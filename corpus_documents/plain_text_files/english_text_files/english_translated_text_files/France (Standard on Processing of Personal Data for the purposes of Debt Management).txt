WHO Is THIS REPOSITORY ?

This repository provides a framework implemented by bodies governed by private law or public
treatment management of unpaid proved, that is to say, cases in which the person concerned is
undoubtedly owed a sum of money.
It does not apply to the processing implemented to detect a non-payment risk or to identify
violations other than monetary (such as, for example, antisocial behaviour of customers).
Given the particular nature of their activities, this repository does not apply to the treatments put in
place by the organizations management and collection of receivables and the investigative agencies, civil.

SCOPE OF THE REPOSITORY

The treatments implemented for the purposes of management of arrears, they are implemented on the basis of tools
internal or outsourced to a service provider, lead to collect data about
individuals (clients, prospects, suppliers, and any person likely to be in a relationship
contract with the organization in the context of the management of its commercial activity). As such, they are
subject to the provisions of the RGPD and the law of 6 January 1978, as amended.
The organizations involved, as controllers, must implement all the measures
technical and organisational measures to ensure a high level of data protection as
personal as the design of treatment and throughout the life of the latter. They must, furthermore, be
able to demonstrate compliance at any time. The treatments implemented must be entered in the
register provided for in article 30 of the RGPD (

see models register on the site cnil.fr
).
The application of this standard allows us to ensure treatment compliance management
outstanding in the light of the principles relating to the protection of data. It is also a
assistance with the completion of an impact assessment on the protection of data (AIPD) in the
cases where it is necessary. The organizations will be able to define the measures to
to ensure proportionality and the necessity of their treatment (points 3 to 7), to ensure the
rights of persons (points 8 and 9) and control their risks (paragraph 10). To this end,

the organization may refer to the guidelines of the CNIL impact analyses
relating to the protection of data (AIPD).

OBJECTIVE(S) PURSUED(S) BY THE TREATMENT (PURPOSES)

Treatment of bad debt management can be implemented for the following purposes :
(a)
the census of unpaid proven ;
(b)
the identification of persons in a situation of a non-payment for the purpose of exclusion for any
transaction to come.
The information collected for these purposes may not be re-used to pursue another
goal, which would be incompatible with the original purpose. Out of any new use of the data must observe
the principles of protection of personal data. The processes used must not give rise
to interconnections or exchanges other than those necessary to the accomplishment of the purposes above
set forth.

Because the more sensitive, this repository is not intended to frame the following treatments :
- prevention of unpaid, including an assessment (scoring) in order to determine whether a person is
likely to be in a situation of a non-payment ;
- the enrichment of the processing on the basis of information collected by or from third parties ;
- share one-time and/or the sharing of the identity of persons in a situation of a non-payment with
third party and/or with other accounts receivable.

BASE(S) LEGAL(S) OF TREATMENT

Each purpose of the processing must match one of the legal foundations laid down by the regulation.
The purpose of the exclusion of the person for the entire transaction to come, can be based on the execution of a
contract to which the person concerned is a party.
In the case where the exclusion decision would be taken in a fully automated way, it is
imperative, in application of article 22, paragraph 2(a) of the RGPD, the processing is based on
his character necessary for the conclusion of a contract between the person concerned and
the body.
The legal basis should be brought to the attention of the persons whose data are being processed as they
allow, in particular, to determine their rights.

5.

PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED

In an effort minimization of personal data processed, the organization should ensure that it does collect and
use the data which is relevant and necessary in the light of its own needs in terms of management of arrears. It
may include data relating to :
(a)
the identification of the person concerned ;
(b)
the means of payment used (see also point 7) ;
(c)
the payment incident (file number, date of occurrence of the unpaid amount of the outstanding
reason of the non-payment, etc).
After being assured of the necessity and the relevance of the personal data that it uses, the agency must
also ensure, throughout the lifetime of the treatment, the quality of the data it processes. This means
in practice that, in accordance with the regulation, the data accurate and up-to-date.

6.

THE RECIPIENTS OF THE INFORMATION

The personal data must only be made accessible to the persons entitled to know
in the light of their duties.
The access right must be documented by the organizations, and the access to the different treatments
should be subject to measures of traceability (see point 9 on the security).
In case of using a sub-contractor, the contract with the agency must make mention of obligations
obligations regarding data protection (article 28 of the RGPD). The
Guide sub-contractor
ished by the
CNIL specifies the obligations and the clauses included in the contracts.
To ensure the continuity of the protection of personal data, the transfers of these
outside the european Union are subject to special rules. Thus, any transmission of data outside
of the EU must :
- be based on a decision of adequacy ; or
- to be framed by binding corporate rules, model clauses, data protection, a code
of conduct or a certification mechanism approved by the CNIL ; or
- to be governed by contractual terms ad hoc pre-authorized by the CNIL ; or
- to respond to one of the derogations provided for in article 49 of the RGPD.

RETENTION PERIODS

A shelf-life of certain should be fixed according to each purpose. In any case, the data
must not be stored for an indefinite period of time.
In the case of regularisation of the non-payment, the information relating to the person concerned must be erased from the
file identifying the persons in a situation of a non-payment at the latest within 48 hours from the time that
the outstanding payment has been actually paid. If the circumstances so warrant, the agency may, on an exceptional basis,
to keep the data relating to the unpaid-even if this has been rectified, provided that it can demonstrate
that such preservation is necessary and proportionate, in order to prevent their renewal.
In the case of non-regularization, the information may be retained in the file, identifying the persons
in the situation of unpaid and excluding the benefit of a service, within the limit of 3 years from
the occurrence of the unpaid amount.
In any event, they can be archived, if the person responsible for the processing is the legal obligation (for
example, to meet obligations, accounting or tax) or if he wants to be used as an evidence in
case of litigation and in the limit of the applicable limitation period.
For more information, you can refer to the guides of the CNIL :
-"
Safety : Archive in a secure manner
"
;
- " Limit the retention of data ".
The data is used for statistical purposes only are more qualified of personal data when
they have been duly anonymized (
See the guidelines of the article 29 working party on the anonymisation
).

PEOPLE INFORMATION

A processing of personal data should be implemented in full transparency vis-Ã -vis the persons
concerned.

terms and conditions of the processing of their personal data under the conditions provided for in articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD.
