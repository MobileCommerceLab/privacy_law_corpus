freedoms and guarantees of the data subject.

for exercising the legal or statutory rights of the controller or when the data subject has given his explicit consent for such processing, in both cases with guarantees of non-discrimination and with the security
measures provided for in Article 15.
3 – The processing of the data referred to in 1 shall also be permitted when one of the following conditions applies:
(a) when it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving his consent;
(b) when it is carried out with the data subject’s consent in the course of its legitimate activities by a foundation, association or non-profit seeking body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade
union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed
to a third party without the consent of the data subjects;
(c) when it relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data subject, provided his consent for their processing can be clearly inferred from his declarations;
(d) when it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and is exclusively carried out for that purpose.
4 – The processing of data relating to health and sex life, including genetic data, shall be permitted if it is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment or
the management of health-care services, provided those data are processed by a health professional bound by professional secrecy or by another person also subject to an equivalent obligation of secrecy and are
notified to the CNPD under article 27, and where suitable safeguards are provided.

Article 8

Suspicion of illegal activities, criminal and administrative offences

1 – Central registers relating to persons suspected of illegal activities, criminal and administrative offences and decisions applying penalties, security measures, fines and additional penalties may only be created

provided the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding.
3 – The processing of personal data for the purposes of police investigations shall be restricted to the processing necessary to prevent a specific danger or to prosecute a particular offence and to exercise the
responsibilities provided for in the respective implementing statutes or another legal provision or in the terms of an international agreement or convention to which Portugal is party.

Combination of personal data

1 - The combination of personal data not provided for in a legal provision shall be subject to the authorisation of the CNPD, requested by the controller or jointly by the corresponding controllers under Article 27.

The recipients or categories of recipients;
Whether replies are obligatory or voluntary, as well as the possible consequences of failure to reply;

and may be at risk of being seen and used by unauthorised third parties.
5 – The obligation to provide information may be waived by a legal provision or decision of the CNPD on the grounds of State security and criminal prevention or investigation and also in particular for processing
for statistical purposes or for the purposes of historical or scientific research, when the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort or if recording or disclosure is
expressly laid down by law.
6 – The obligation to provide information under this Article shall not apply to the processing of data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression.

Article 11

Right of access

right to object free of charge to such disclosure or uses.
Article 13

put his point of view.

Article 14

Security of processing

1 – The controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or
access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their
implementation, such measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected.

processing to be carried out, and must ensure compliance with those measures.

when and by whom (control of input);
h) in transmitting personal data and in transporting the respective media, prevent unauthorised reading, copying, alteration or elimination of data (control of transport).

guaranteeing respect for the fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees of the data subjects.
3 – The systems must guarantee logical separation between data relating to health and sex life, including genetic data, and other personal data.
4 – Where circulation over a network of the data referred to in articles 7 and 8 may jeopardise the fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees of their data subjects the CNPD may determine that
transmission must be encoded.
