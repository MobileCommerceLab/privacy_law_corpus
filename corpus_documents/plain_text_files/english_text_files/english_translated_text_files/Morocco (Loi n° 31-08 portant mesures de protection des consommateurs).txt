consumer or bodily injury caused to him, resulting from an act or a
omission of the supplier;

disproportionately high amount or the accumulation of several indemnities;

he did not have the opportunity to take cognizance before the conclusion of the
contract;

too high in relation to the price or tariff agreed upon when the contract was concluded;

service provided complies with the stipulations of the contract or confers on it the exclusive right
to interpret any clause of the contract;

agents or to subject their commitments to compliance with a specific formality;
15) To oblige the consumer to perform his obligations even though the supplier
would not perform his;
