Remarks :- The reason for the enactment of this Act is that nowadays there are and have been
many cases of violations of the right to the privacy protection of personal data resulting in the
nuisance to or damages to the data subject. In addition, the technological developments has
increased the ease, convenience and swiftness of the collection, use and disclosure of personal
data that are done in a manner constituting such violations, which also causes the damages to
the economy in overall. Therefore, it is appropriate to have the law governing the personal
data protection in general in order to prescribe the rules, mechanism, or measures regulating
personal data protection as a matter of general principles, and thus the Act is necessary to be
enacted.
