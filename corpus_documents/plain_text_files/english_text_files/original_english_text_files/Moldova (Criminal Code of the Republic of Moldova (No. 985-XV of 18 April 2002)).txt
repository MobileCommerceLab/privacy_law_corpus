not be executed while those with a more favorable treatment in a new law shall be

alternative punishment according to the provisions in par. (1)-(4) shall be considered.
(6) Should the act the person was punished for be not considered a crime anymore in line

Chapter II
CRIME
Article 14. Concept of the Crime
(1) A crime is a prejudicial act (action or inaction) set forth in criminal law committed with
culpability and subject to criminal punishment.
(2) An action or inaction that although formally has signs of an act set forth herein but due to
lack of importance does not meet the prejudicial degree of a crime shall not be
considered a crime.
Article 15. Prejudicial Degree of a Crime

characterizes the elements of a crime: the object, the objective side, the subject, and the
subjective side.
Article 16. Classification of Crimes
(1) Depending upon their prejudicial nature and degree, the crimes set forth herein are
classified into the following categories: minor, less serious, serious, especially serious,
and exceptionally serious.

punishment by imprisonment for a term of up to 2 years inclusively.
(3) Less serious crimes are considered acts for which criminal law provides for a maximum
punishment by imprisonment for a term of up to 5 years inclusively.
(4) Serious crimes are considered acts for which criminal law provides for a maximum

realized the prejudicial nature of his/her action or inaction, foresaw its prejudicial
consequences, and wanted or consciously admitted the occurrence of such consequences.
Article 18. Crime Committed by Imprudence
A crime is considered as being committed by imprudence if the person who committed it

prejudicial consequences although the person should have and could have foreseen such
consequences.
Article 19. Crime Committed with Two Forms of Guilt
If a crime committed with intent leads to more severe consequences which according to the
law imply a more severe criminal punishment and which were not part of the intent of the
offender, the criminal liability for such consequences shall be applied only if the person
foresaw the prejudicial consequences but thoughtlessly considered that such could be avoided,

committed with intent.
