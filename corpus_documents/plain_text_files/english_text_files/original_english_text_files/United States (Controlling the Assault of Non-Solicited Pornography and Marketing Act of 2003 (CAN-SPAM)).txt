§7701. Congressional findings and policy
(a) Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1) Electronic mail has become an extremely important and popular means of
communication, relied on by millions of Americans on a daily basis for personal and
commercial purposes. Its low cost and global reach make it extremely convenient and
efficient, and offer unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless
commerce.
(2) The convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are threatened by the extremely rapid
growth in the volume of unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited commercial
electronic mail is currently estimated to account for over half of all electronic mail traffic, up
from an estimated 7 percent in 2001, and the volume continues to rise. Most of these
messages are fraudulent or deceptive in one or more respects.
(3) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail may result in costs to recipients
who cannot refuse to accept such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, or for
the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding such mail, or for both.
(4) The receipt of a large number of unwanted messages also decreases the convenience
of electronic mail and creates a risk that wanted electronic mail messages, both commercial
and noncommercial, will be lost, overlooked, or discarded amidst the larger volume of
unwanted messages, thus reducing the reliability and usefulness of electronic mail to the
recipient.
(5) Some commercial electronic mail contains material that many recipients may consider
vulgar or pornographic in nature.
(6) The growth in unsolicited commercial electronic mail imposes significant monetary costs
on providers of Internet access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit
institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a finite volume of mail that such
providers, businesses, and institutions can handle without further investment in infrastructure.
(7) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail purposefully disguise the source
of such mail.
(8) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail purposefully include misleading
information in the messages' subject lines in order to induce the recipients to view the
messages.
(9) While some senders of commercial electronic mail messages provide simple and
reliable ways for recipients to reject (or "opt-out" of) receipt of commercial electronic mail from
such senders in the future, other senders provide no such "opt-out" mechanism, or refuse to

honor the requests of recipients not to receive electronic mail from such senders in the future,
or both.
(10) Many senders of bulk unsolicited commercial electronic mail use computer programs to
gather large numbers of electronic mail addresses on an automated basis from Internet
websites or online services where users must post their addresses in order to make full use of
the website or service.
(11) Many States have enacted legislation intended to regulate or reduce unsolicited
commercial electronic mail, but these statutes impose different standards and requirements.
As a result, they do not appear to have been successful in addressing the problems
associated with unsolicited commercial electronic mail, in part because, since an electronic
mail address does not specify a geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for
law-abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate statutes they are required to
comply.
(12) The problems associated with the rapid growth and abuse of unsolicited commercial
electronic mail cannot be solved by Federal legislation alone. The development and adoption
of technological approaches and the pursuit of cooperative efforts with other countries will be
necessary as well.
(b) Congressional determination of public policy
On the basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress determines that—
(1) there is a substantial government interest in regulation of commercial electronic mail on
a nationwide basis;
(2) senders of commercial electronic mail should not mislead recipients as to the source or
content of such mail; and
(3) recipients of commercial electronic mail have a right to decline to receive additional
commercial electronic mail from the same source.

Effective Date
Pub. L. 108–187, §16, Dec. 16, 2003, 117 Stat. 2719, provided that: "The provisions of this
Act [see Short Title note below], other than section 9 [enacting section 7708 of this title], shall
take effect on January 1, 2004."
Short Title
Pub. L. 108–187, §1, Dec. 16, 2003, 117 Stat. 2699, provided that: "This Act [enacting this
chapter and section 1037 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, amending section 227 of
Title 47, Telecommunications, and enacting provisions listed in a table relating to sentencing
guidelines set out as a note under section 994 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure] may
be cited as the 'Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of
2003', or the 'CAN-SPAM Act of 2003'."

§7702. Definitions
In this chapter:

(1) Affirmative consent
The term "affirmative consent", when used with respect to a commercial electronic mail
message, means that—
(A) the recipient expressly consented to receive the message, either in response to a
clear and conspicuous request for such consent or at the recipient's own initiative; and
(B) if the message is from a party other than the party to which the recipient
communicated such consent, the recipient was given clear and conspicuous notice at the
time the consent was communicated that the recipient's electronic mail address could be
transferred to such other party for the purpose of initiating commercial electronic mail
messages.
(2) Commercial electronic mail message
(A) In general
The term "commercial electronic mail message" means any electronic mail message the
primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial
product or service (including content on an Internet website operated for a commercial
purpose).
(B) Transactional or relationship messages
The term "commercial electronic mail message" does not include a transactional or
relationship message.
(C) Regulations regarding primary purpose
Not later than 12 months after December 16, 2003, the Commission shall issue
regulations pursuant to section 7711 of this title defining the relevant criteria to facilitate the
determination of the primary purpose of an electronic mail message.
(D) Reference to company or website
The inclusion of a reference to a commercial entity or a link to the website of a
commercial entity in an electronic mail message does not, by itself, cause such message to
be treated as a commercial electronic mail message for purposes of this chapter if the
contents or circumstances of the message indicate a primary purpose other than
commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service.
(3) Commission
The term "Commission" means the Federal Trade Commission.
(4) Domain name
The term "domain name" means any alphanumeric designation which is registered with or
assigned by any domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name
registration authority as part of an electronic address on the Internet.

The term "electronic mail address" means a destination, commonly expressed as a string of
characters, consisting of a unique user name or mailbox (commonly referred to as the "local
part") and a reference to an Internet domain (commonly referred to as the "domain part"),
whether or not displayed, to which an electronic mail message can be sent or delivered.

The term "header information" means the source, destination, and routing information
attached to an electronic mail message, including the originating domain name and
originating electronic mail address, and any other information that appears in the line
identifying, or purporting to identify, a person initiating the message.
(9) Initiate
The term "initiate", when used with respect to a commercial electronic mail message,
means to originate or transmit such message or to procure the origination or transmission of
such message, but shall not include actions that constitute routine conveyance of such
message. For purposes of this paragraph, more than one person may be considered to have
initiated a message.
(10) Internet
The term "Internet" has the meaning given that term in the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47
U.S.C. 151 nt).
(11) Internet access service
The term "Internet access service" has the meaning given that term in section 231(e)(4) of
title 47.
(12) Procure

recipient shall be treated as a separate recipient with respect to each such address. If an
electronic mail address is reassigned to a new user, the new user shall not be treated as a
recipient of any commercial electronic mail message sent or delivered to that address before
it was reassigned.
(15) Routine conveyance

commercial electronic mail message, means a person who initiates such a message and
whose product, service, or Internet web site is advertised or promoted by the message.
(B) Separate lines of business or divisions
If an entity operates through separate lines of business or divisions and holds itself out to
the recipient throughout the message as that particular line of business or division rather
than as the entity of which such line of business or division is a part, then the line of
business or the division shall be treated as the sender of such message for purposes of this
chapter.
(17) Transactional or relationship message

(a) Omitted
(b) United States Sentencing Commission
(1) Directive
Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28 and in accordance with this section,
the United States Sentencing Commission shall review and, as appropriate, amend the
sentencing guidelines and policy statements to provide appropriate penalties for violations of
section 1037 of title 18, as added by this section, and other offenses that may be facilitated by
the sending of large quantities of unsolicited electronic mail.
(2) Requirements
In carrying out this subsection, the Sentencing Commission shall consider providing
sentencing enhancements for—

and prosecute those who send bulk commercial e-mail to facilitate the commission of Federal
crimes, including the tools contained in chapters 47 and 63 of title 18 (relating to fraud and
false statements); chapter 71 of title 18 (relating to obscenity); chapter 110 of title 18 (relating
to the sexual exploitation of children); and chapter 95 of title 18 (relating to racketeering), as
appropriate.

§7704. Other protections for users of commercial electronic mail
(a) Requirements for transmission of messages
(1) Prohibition of false or misleading transmission information
It is unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission, to a protected computer, of a
commercial electronic mail message, or a transactional or relationship message, that
contains, or is accompanied by, header information that is materially false or materially
misleading. For purposes of this paragraph—
(A) header information that is technically accurate but includes an originating electronic
mail address, domain name, or Internet Protocol address the access to which for purposes
of initiating the message was obtained by means of false or fraudulent pretenses or
representations shall be considered materially misleading;

(B) a "from" line (the line identifying or purporting to identify a person initiating the
message) that accurately identifies any person who initiated the message shall not be
considered materially false or materially misleading; and
(C) header information shall be considered materially misleading if it fails to identify
accurately a protected computer used to initiate the message because the person initiating
the message knowingly uses another protected computer to relay or retransmit the
message for purposes of disguising its origin.
(2) Prohibition of deceptive subject headings
It is unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission to a protected computer of a
commercial electronic mail message if such person has actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly
implied on the basis of objective circumstances, that a subject heading of the message would
be likely to mislead a recipient, acting reasonably under the circumstances, about a material
fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message (consistent with the criteria used
in enforcement of section 45 of this title).
(3) Inclusion of return address or comparable mechanism in commercial electronic
mail
(A) In general
It is unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission to a protected computer of a
commercial electronic mail message that does not contain a functioning return electronic
mail address or other Internet-based mechanism, clearly and conspicuously displayed,
that—
(i) a recipient may use to submit, in a manner specified in the message, a reply
electronic mail message or other form of Internet-based communication requesting not to
receive future commercial electronic mail messages from that sender at the electronic
mail address where the message was received; and
(ii) remains capable of receiving such messages or communications for no less than 30
days after the transmission of the original message.
(B) More detailed options possible
The person initiating a commercial electronic mail message may comply with
subparagraph (A)(i) by providing the recipient a list or menu from which the recipient may
choose the specific types of commercial electronic mail messages the recipient wants to
receive or does not want to receive from the sender, if the list or menu includes an option
under which the recipient may choose not to receive any commercial electronic mail
messages from the sender.
(C) Temporary inability to receive messages or process requests
A return electronic mail address or other mechanism does not fail to satisfy the
requirements of subparagraph (A) if it is unexpectedly and temporarily unable to receive
messages or process requests due to a technical problem beyond the control of the sender
if the problem is corrected within a reasonable time period.
(4) Prohibition of transmission of commercial electronic mail after objection
(A) In general

If a recipient makes a request using a mechanism provided pursuant to paragraph (3) not
to receive some or any commercial electronic mail messages from such sender, then it is
unlawful—
(i) for the sender to initiate the transmission to the recipient, more than 10 business
days after the receipt of such request, of a commercial electronic mail message that falls
within the scope of the request;
(ii) for any person acting on behalf of the sender to initiate the transmission to the
recipient, more than 10 business days after the receipt of such request, of a commercial
electronic mail message with actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied on the basis
of objective circumstances, that such message falls within the scope of the request;
(iii) for any person acting on behalf of the sender to assist in initiating the transmission
to the recipient, through the provision or selection of addresses to which the message will
be sent, of a commercial electronic mail message with actual knowledge, or knowledge
fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances, that such message would violate
clause (i) or (ii); or
(iv) for the sender, or any other person who knows that the recipient has made such a
request, to sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise transfer or release the electronic mail
address of the recipient (including through any transaction or other transfer involving
mailing lists bearing the electronic mail address of the recipient) for any purpose other
than compliance with this chapter or other provision of law.
(B) Subsequent affirmative consent
A prohibition in subparagraph (A) does not apply if there is affirmative consent by the
recipient subsequent to the request under subparagraph (A).
(5) Inclusion of identifier, opt-out, and physical address in commercial electronic mail
(A) It is unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission of any commercial electronic
mail message to a protected computer unless the message provides—
(i) clear and conspicuous identification that the message is an advertisement or
solicitation;
(ii) clear and conspicuous notice of the opportunity under paragraph (3) to decline to
receive further commercial electronic mail messages from the sender; and
(iii) a valid physical postal address of the sender.
(B) Subparagraph (A)(i) does not apply to the transmission of a commercial electronic mail
message if the recipient has given prior affirmative consent to receipt of the message.
(6) Materially
For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "materially", when used with respect to false or
misleading header information, includes the alteration or concealment of header information
in a manner that would impair the ability of an Internet access service processing the
message on behalf of a recipient, a person alleging a violation of this section, or a law
enforcement agency to identify, locate, or respond to a person who initiated the electronic
mail message or to investigate the alleged violation, or the ability of a recipient of the
message to respond to a person who initiated the electronic message.

(b) Aggravated violations relating to commercial electronic mail
(1) Address harvesting and dictionary attacks
(A) In general
It is unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission, to a protected computer, of a
commercial electronic mail message that is unlawful under subsection (a), or to assist in the
origination of such message through the provision or selection of addresses to which the
message will be transmitted, if such person had actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly
implied on the basis of objective circumstances, that—
(i) the electronic mail address of the recipient was obtained using an automated means
from an Internet website or proprietary online service operated by another person, and
such website or online service included, at the time the address was obtained, a notice
stating that the operator of such website or online service will not give, sell, or otherwise
transfer addresses maintained by such website or online service to any other party for the
purposes of initiating, or enabling others to initiate, electronic mail messages; or
(ii) the electronic mail address of the recipient was obtained using an automated means
that generates possible electronic mail addresses by combining names, letters, or
numbers into numerous permutations.
(B) Disclaimer
Nothing in this paragraph creates an ownership or proprietary interest in such electronic
mail addresses.
(2) Automated creation of multiple electronic mail accounts
It is unlawful for any person to use scripts or other automated means to register for multiple
electronic mail accounts or online user accounts from which to transmit to a protected
computer, or enable another person to transmit to a protected computer, a commercial
electronic mail message that is unlawful under subsection (a).
(3) Relay or retransmission through unauthorized access
It is unlawful for any person knowingly to relay or retransmit a commercial electronic mail
message that is unlawful under subsection (a) from a protected computer or computer
network that such person has accessed without authorization.
(c) Supplementary rulemaking authority
The Commission shall by regulation, pursuant to section 7711 of this title—
(1) modify the 10-business-day period under subsection (a)(4)(A) or subsection (a)(4)(B), or
both, if the Commission determines that a different period would be more reasonable after
taking into account—
(A) the purposes of subsection (a);
(B) the interests of recipients of commercial electronic mail; and
(C) the burdens imposed on senders of lawful commercial electronic mail; and
(2) specify additional activities or practices to which subsection (b) applies if the
Commission determines that those activities or practices are contributing substantially to the
proliferation of commercial electronic mail messages that are unlawful under subsection (a).

(d) Requirement to place warning labels on commercial electronic mail containing
sexually oriented material
(1) In general
No person may initiate in or affecting interstate commerce the transmission, to a protected
computer, of any commercial electronic mail message that includes sexually oriented material
and—
(A) fail to include in subject heading for the electronic mail message the marks or notices
prescribed by the Commission under this subsection; or
(B) fail to provide that the matter in the message that is initially viewable to the recipient,
when the message is opened by any recipient and absent any further actions by the
recipient, includes only—
(i) to the extent required or authorized pursuant to paragraph (2), any such marks or
notices;
(ii) the information required to be included in the message pursuant to subsection
(a)(5); and
(iii) instructions on how to access, or a mechanism to access, the sexually oriented
material.
(2) Prior affirmative consent
Paragraph (1) does not apply to the transmission of an electronic mail message if the
recipient has given prior affirmative consent to receipt of the message.
(3) Prescription of marks and notices
Not later than 120 days after December 16, 2003, the Commission in consultation with the
Attorney General shall prescribe clearly identifiable marks or notices to be included in or
associated with commercial electronic mail that contains sexually oriented material, in order to
inform the recipient of that fact and to facilitate filtering of such electronic mail. The
Commission shall publish in the Federal Register and provide notice to the public of the
marks or notices prescribed under this paragraph.
(4) Definition
In this subsection, the term "sexually oriented material" means any material that depicts
sexually explicit conduct (as that term is defined in section 2256 of title 18), unless the
depiction constitutes a small and insignificant part of the whole, the remainder of which is not
primarily devoted to sexual matters.
(5) Penalty
Whoever knowingly violates paragraph (1) shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not
more than 5 years, or both.

§7705. Businesses knowingly promoted by electronic mail with false or
misleading transmission information
(a) In general
It is unlawful for a person to promote, or allow the promotion of, that person's trade or
business, or goods, products, property, or services sold, offered for sale, leased or offered for
lease, or otherwise made available through that trade or business, in a commercial electronic
mail message the transmission of which is in violation of section 7704(a)(1) of this title if that
person—
(1) knows, or should have known in the ordinary course of that person's trade or business,
that the goods, products, property, or services sold, offered for sale, leased or offered for
lease, or otherwise made available through that trade or business were being promoted in
such a message;
(2) received or expected to receive an economic benefit from such promotion; and
(3) took no reasonable action—

(b) Limited enforcement against third parties
(1) In general
Except as provided in paragraph (2), a person (hereinafter referred to as the "third party")
that provides goods, products, property, or services to another person that violates subsection
(a) shall not be held liable for such violation.
(2) Exception
Liability for a violation of subsection (a) shall be imputed to a third party that provides
goods, products, property, or services to another person that violates subsection (a) if that
third party—

not be subject to paragraph (1), the rules shall require such providers, in addition to
complying with the other provisions of this chapter, to allow subscribers to indicate a desire
not to receive future mobile service commercial messages from the provider—
(A) at the time of subscribing to such service; and

commercial electronic mail message to reasonably determine that the message is a mobile
service commercial message.

In this section, the term "mobile service commercial message" means a commercial electronic
mail message that is transmitted directly to a wireless device that is utilized by a subscriber of
