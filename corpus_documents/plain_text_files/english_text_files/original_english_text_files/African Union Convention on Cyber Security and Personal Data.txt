AFRICAN UNION CONVENTION ON CYBER SECURITY
AND PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

RSE FA ENC GET PT SAE TET OPT BABEL 8 TTT NNT AIEEE

PREAMBLE
The Member States of the African Union:
Guided by the Constitutive Act of the African Union adopted in 2000;

Considering that this Convention on the Establishment of a Legal Framework for
Cyber-security and Personal Data Protection embodies the existing commitments
of African Union Member States at sub-regional, regional and international levels to
build the Information Society,

Recalling that it aims at defining the objectives and broad orientations of the
Information Society in Africa and strengthening existing legislations on Information
and Communication Technologies (ICTs) of Member States and the Regional
Economic Communities (RECs);

Reaffirming the commitment of Member States to fundamental freedoms and
human and peoples’ rights contained in the declarations, conventions and other
instruments adopted within the framework of the African Union and the United
Nations;

Considering that the establishment of a regulatory framework on cyber-security and
personal data protection takes into account the requirements of respect for the rights
of citizens, guaranteed under the fundamental texts of domestic law and protected
by international human rights Conventions and Treaties, particularly the African
Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights;

Mindful of the need to mobilize all public and private actors (States, local
communities, private sector enterprises, civil society organizations, the media,
training and research institutions, etc.) for the promotion of cyber security,

Reiterating the principles of the African Information Society Initiative (AISI) and the
Regional Action Plan on the Knowledge Economy (ARAPKE),

Aware that it is meant to regulate a particularly evolving technological domain, and
with a view to meeting the high expectations of many actors with often divergent
interests, this convention sets forth the security rules essential for establishing a
credible digital space for electronic transactions, personal data protection and
combating cybercrime;

Bearing in mind that the major obstacles to the development of electronic
commerce in Africa are linked to security issues, particularly:

a) The gaps affecting the regulation of legal recognition of data
communications and electronic signature;

 

 
 

 

1: ART RT HER TE PET ST IE

2

b) The absence of specific legal rules that protect consumers, intellectual
property rights, personal data and information systems;

c) The absence of e-services and telecommuting legislations;

d) The application of electronic techniques to commercial and
administrative acts;

e) The probative elements introduced by digital techniques (time stamping,
certification, etc.);

f) The rules applicable to cryptology devices and services;
g) The oversight of on-line advertising,

h) The absence of appropriate fiscal and customs legislations for electronic
commerce;

Convinced that the afore-listed observations justify the call for the establishment of
an appropriate normative framework consistent with the African legal, cultural,
economic and social environment; and that the objective of this Convention is
therefore to provide the necessary security and legal framework for the emergence
of the knowledge economy in Africa;

Stressing that at another level, the protection of personal data and private life
constitutes a major challenge to the Information Society for governments as well as
other stakeholders: and that such protection requires a balance between the use of
information and communication technologies and the protection of the privacy of
citizens in their daily or professional lives, while guaranteeing the free flow of
information;

Concerned by the urgent need to establish a mechanism to address the dangers
and risks deriving from the use of electronic data and individual records, with a view
to respecting privacy and freedoms while enhancing the promotion and development
of ICTs in Member States of the African Union;

Considering that the goal of this Convention is to address the need for harmonized
legislation in the area of cyber security in Member States of the African Union, and
to establish in each State party a mechanism capable of combating violations of
privacy that may be generated by personal data collection, processing, transmission,
storage and use; that by proposing a type of institutional basis, the Convention
guarantees that whatever form of processing is used shall respect the basic
freedoms and rights of individuals while also taking into account the prerogatives of
States, the rights of local communities and the interests of businesses; and take on
board internationally recognized best practices;

Considering that the protection under criminal law of the system of values of the
information society is a necessity prompted by security considerations, that is

 
 

 

aed eatin ced STL

3

reflected primarily by the need for appropriate criminal legislation in the fight against
cybercrime in general, and money laundering in particular;

Aware of the need, given the current state of cybercrime which constitutes a real
threat to the security of computer networks and the development of the Information
Society in Africa, to define broad guidelines of the strategy for the repression of
cybercrime in Member States of the African Union, taking into account their existing
commitments at sub-regional, regional and international levels;

Considering that this Convention seeks, in terms of substantive criminal law, to
modernize instruments for the repression of cybercrime by formulating a policy for
the adoption of new offences specific to ICTs, and aligning certain offences,
sanctions and criminal liability systems in force in Member States with the ICT
environment;

Considering further that in terms of criminal procedural law, the Convention
defines the framework for the adaptation of standard proceedings concerning
information and telecommunication technologies and spells out the conditions for
instituting proceedings specific to cybercrime;

Recalling Decision Assembly/AU/Decl.1(XIV) of the Fourteenth Ordinary Session
of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union on
Information and Communication Technologies in Africa: Challenges and Prospects
for Development, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 31 January to 2 February 2010;

Taking into account the Oliver Tambo Declaration adopted by the Conference of
African Ministers in charge of Information and Communication Technologies held in
Johannesburg, South Africa on 5 November 2009;

Recalling the provisions of the Abidjan Declaration adopted on 22 February 2012
and the Addis Ababa Declaration adopted on 22 June 2012 on the Harmonization of

Section Il: Contractual Obligations in Electronic Form

Article 5
Electronic contracts

The information requested for the purpose of concluding a contract or
information available during contract execution may be transmitted by
electronic means if the recipients have agreed to the use of that means. The
use of electronic communications is presumed to be acceptable unless the
recipient has previously expressly stated a preference for an alternative
means of communication.

A service provider or supplier, who offers goods and services in a
professional capacity by electronic means, shall make available the
applicable contractual conditions directly or indirectly, in a way that facilitates
the conservation and reproduction of such conditions according to national

legislations.

For the contract to be validly concluded, the offeree shall have had the
opportunity to verify details of his/her order, particularly the price thereof, prior
to confirming the said order and signifying his/her acceptance.

The person offering his/her goods and services shall acknowledge receipt of
the order so addressed to him/her without unjustified delay and by electronic

means.

The order, the confirmation of acceptance of an offer and the
acknowledgment of receipt are deemed to be received when the parties to
whom they are addressed are able to access to them.

Exemptions may be made to the provisions of Articles 5.3 and 5.4 of this
Convention for agreements concluded between businesses or professionals

(B2B).

a) Any natural or legal person engaged in the activity defined in the first
paragraph of Article 2.1 of this Convention shall, ipso facto, be
accountable to his/her contractual partner for the proper performance of
the obligations arising from the contract, irrespective of whether such
obligations are to be carried out by himself/herself or by other service
providers, without prejudice to his/her right to claim against the said
service providers.

b) However, the natural or legal person may be released from all or part of
the liability by proving that the non-fulfilment or poor performance of the
contract is due either to the contractual partner or a case of force

majeure.

Article 6
Writing in electronic form

Without prejudice to existing domestic legislative provisions in the State Party,
no person shall be compelled to take legal action by electronic means.

a) Where a written document shall be required for the validity of a legal act
each State Party shall establish the legal conditions for functional
equivalence between electronic communications and paper-based
documents, when the internal regulations require a written document for

the validity of a legal act.

b) Where a paper document has been subject to specific conditions as to
legibility or presentation, the written document in electronic form shall be
subject to the same conditions.

c) The requirement to transmit several copies of a written document shall

be deemed to have been met in electronic form, where the said written
document can be reproduced in material form by the addressee.

The provisions of Article 6.2 of this Convention do not apply to the following:

a) Signed private deeds relating to family law and law of succession; and

b) Acts under private signature relating to personal or real guarantees in
accordance with domestic legislations, whether made under civil or
commercial law, unless they are entered into by a person for the

purposes of his/her profession.

The delivery of a written document in electronic form shall be effective when
the addressee takes due note and acknowledges receipt thereof.

Given their tax functions, invoices must be in writing to ensure the readability,
integrity and sustainability of the content. The authenticity of the origin must

also be guaranteed.

Among the methods that may be implemented to fulfil the tax purposes of the
invoice and to ensure that its functions have been met is the establishment of
management controls which create a reliable audit trail between an invoice
and a supply of goods or services.

In addition to the type of controls described in § 1, the following methods are
examples of technologies that ensure the authenticity of origin and integrity of

content of an electronic invoice:
a) aqualified electronic signature as defined in Article 1;

b) electronic data interchange (EDI), understood as the electronic transfer,
from computer to computer, of commercial and administrative data in the

Aer

a erg

 

 
 

 

12

form of an EDI message structured according to an agreed standard,
provided that the agreement to the exchange provides for the use of
procedures guaranteeing the authenticity of the origin and data integrity.

A written document in electronic form is admissible in evidence in the same
way as a paper-based document, and shall have the same force of law,
provided that the person from whom it originates can be duly identified and
that it has been made out and retained in a manner that guarantees its
integrity.

Section Ill: Security of Electronic Transactions

Article 7
Ensuring the Security of Electronic Transactions

a) The supplier of goods shall allow his/her clients to make payments using
electronic payment methods approved by the State according to the
regulations in force in each State Party.

b) The supplier of goods or provider of services by electronic means who
claims the discharge of an obligation must prove its existence or
otherwise prove that the obligation was discharged or did not exist.

Where the legislative provisions of State Parties have not laid down other
principles, and where there is no valid agreement between the parties, the
judge shall resolve proof related conflicts by determining by all possible
means the most plausible claim regardless of the message base employed.

a) A copy or any other reproduction of contracts signed by electronic
means shall have the same probative value as the contract itself, where
the said copy has been certified as a true copy of the said act by bodies
duly accredited by an authority of the State Party.

b) Certification will result in the issuance, where necessary, of a certificate
of conformity.

a) Anelectronic signature created by a secure device which the signatory is
able to keep under his exclusive control and is appended to a digital
certificate shall be admissible as signature on the same terms as a
handwritten signature.

b) The reliability of the procedure is presumed, unless otherwise proven, if
the electronic signature is generated by a secure signature creation
device, the integrity of the act is guaranteed and the identification of the
signatory is ensured.
