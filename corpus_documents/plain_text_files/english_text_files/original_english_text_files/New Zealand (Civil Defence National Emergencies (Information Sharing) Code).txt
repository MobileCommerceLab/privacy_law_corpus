Meaning of permitted purpose

(1)

A permitted purpose is a purpose that directly relates to the government or local
government management of response to, and recovery from, an emergency in relation
to which a state of national emergency exists.

(2)

Without limiting subclause (1), any of the following is a permitted purpose in
relation to an emergency—
(a)

identifying individuals who—
(i)

are or may be injured, missing or dead as a result of the emergency; or

(ii) are or may be otherwise involved in the emergency; or

For the purposes of subclause (2), a person is responsible for an individual if the

a parent of the individual; or

(b)

a child or sibling of the individual and at least 18 years old; or

(c)

6

Collection, use and disclosure of personal information for permitted purpose

(1)

In relation to an emergency, an agency may collect, use or disclose personal
information relating to an individual if the agency believes, on reasonable grounds,
that—
(a)

the individual concerned may be involved in the emergency; and

3

Civil Defence National Emergencies (Information Sharing) Code 2020

(b)

the collection, use or disclosure is for a permitted purpose in relation to the
emergency; and

(c)

in the case of a disclosure of personal information, the disclosure is to—
(i)

a public sector agency, or

(ii) an agency that is, or is likely to be, involved in managing, or assisting
in the management of, the emergency; or
(iii) an agency, or a foreign person or entity, that is directly involved in
providing repatriation services, medical or other treatment, health
services or financial or other humanitarian assistance services to
individuals involved in the emergency, and the disclosing agency has
no reason to believe the individual would not want the information to
be disclosed to that other agency, or foreign person or entity, in the
circumstances; or

(2)

(d)

a person who is responsible for the individual (within the meaning of clause
5(3)); and

(e)

in the case of a disclosure of personal information, the disclosure is not to a
news entity.

Subclause (1) modifies the information privacy principles as follows—
(a)

information privacy principles 2, 10 and 11 by providing additional grounds to
collect, use or disclose information in the circumstances where subclause (1)
applies; and

(b)

information privacy principle 12(1) applies to a disclosure to a foreign person or
entity under clause 6(1)(c)(iii) only to the extent that it is reasonably practicable
in the circumstances for the agency to comply with the requirements of that
principle.

(3)

For the avoidance of doubt, subclause (1) does not limit the exceptions contained in
information privacy principles 2, 10, 11, and 12 or the equivalent rules in any code of
practice.

(4)

Subclause (1) is not limited to collection, use and disclosure of personal information
by agencies within a district directly affected by the emergency.
