NIGERIA DATA PROTECTION REGULATION

(2) Anyone who is entrusted with Personal Data of a Data Subject or who is in
possession of the Personal Data of a Data Subject owes a duty of care to the
said Data Subject;
(3) Anyone who is entrusted with Personal Data of a Data Subject or who is in
possession of the Personal Data of a Data Subject shall be accountable for his
acts and omissions in respect of data processing, and in accordance with the
principles contained in this Regulation.
2.2
LAWFUL PROCESSING
Without prejudice to the principles set out in this Regulation, processing shall be lawful if
at least one of the following applies:
a) the Data Subject has given consent to the processing of his or her Personal
Data for one or more specific purposes;
b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data
Subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject
prior to entering into a contract;
c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the
Controller is subject;
d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data
Subject or of another natural person, and

public interest or in exercise of official public mandate vested in the
controller;

2.3

PROCURING CONSENT
(1)
No data shall be obtained except the specific purpose of collection is
made known to the Data Subject;
(2)

Data Controller is under obligation to ensure that consent of a Data
Subject has been obtained without fraud, coercion or undue influence;
accordingly:
a) where processing is based on consent, the Controller shall be able to
demonstrate that the Data Subject has consented to processing of his or
her Personal Data and the legal capacity to give consent;
8
NIGERIA DATA PROTECTION REGULATION

b) if the Data Subject's consent is given in the context of a written
declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent
shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the
other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear
and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an
infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding on the Data Subject;
c) prior to giving consent, the Data Subject shall be informed of his right
and method to withdraw his consent at any given time. However, the
withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based
on consent before its withdrawal;

whatsoever

purpose other than that for which the Personal Data were collected, the
controller shall provide the Data Subject prior to that further processing with

15

processing where one of the following applies:
a)

a period enabling the Controller to verify the accuracy of the Personal
Data;

b)

The processing is unlawful, and the Data Subject opposes the erasure
of the Personal Data and requests the restriction of their use instead;

(13) The Controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of Personal Data or
restriction to each recipient to whom the Personal Data have been disclosed,
unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller

(14) The Data Subject shall have the right to receive the Personal Data concerning him
or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly
