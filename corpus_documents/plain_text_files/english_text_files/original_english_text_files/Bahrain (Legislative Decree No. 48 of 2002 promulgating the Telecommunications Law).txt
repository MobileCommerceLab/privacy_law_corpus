1

Note that the Arabic word “‫ ”ﻗﺮار‬is used in the Arabic version of the Telecommunications Law for the word
“Determination” in this sentence. “‫ ”ﻗﺮار‬can be translated into the English words of “Decision”, “Determination” or
“Resolution”. In practice TRA Bahrain has tended to use these English words to define specific legal instruments,
whereby “Decisions” or “Determinations” are used for the results of a regulatory process (e.g. a Decision on
Merger Clearance) or regulatory action (e.g. a Determination of Dominance or Significant Market Power) and
where “Resolutions” have been used for mainly administrative decisions such as setting of license fees or
business hours. In preparing this English translation of the Telecommunications Law TRA has attempted used
the word it considers most suitable to define the instrument based upon its purpose in each instance of the use of
the Arabic word “‫”ﻗﺮار‬. This does not prevent TRA from amending its practices in the future. For purposes of
interpretation the Arabic text shall prevail.
