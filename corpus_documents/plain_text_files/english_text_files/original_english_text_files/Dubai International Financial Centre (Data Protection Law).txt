DATA PROTECTION LAW
PART 1: INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
1.

Title and repeal
(1)

This Law may be cited as the “Data Protection Law 2020”.

(2)

This Law repeals and replaces the Data Protection Law, being Law No. 1 of 2007, as it was in force
immediately prior to the commencement of this Law ("the Previous Law"), and all Regulations
made under the Previous Law from commencement of this Law.

(3)

Except where otherwise provided in this Law, anything done or omitted to be done pursuant to or
for the purposes of the Previous Law is deemed to be done or omitted to be done pursuant to or for
the purposes of this Law.

(4)

Without limiting the generality of Article 1(3) and Article 4, and subject only to Article 1(5), such
repeal and replacement shall not affect:
(a)

any right, privilege, remedy, obligation or liability accrued to or incurred by any person;
or

(b)

any investigation, legal or administrative proceeding commenced, or to be commenced, in
respect of any such right, remedy, obligation or liability,

under the Previous Law, and any such legal proceeding shall be instituted, continued or enforced,
including any penalty, fine or forfeiture, under this Law.

2.

(5)

Where there is no equivalent provision in this Law to a provision in the Previous Law, a relevant
provision of the previous Law is deemed to survive the repeal and replacement under this Article 1
until such time as necessary for the purpose of any investigation, legal or administrative proceedings
specified in Article 1(4)(b).

(6)

Unless otherwise provided, any reference to the Previous Law includes Regulations made under the
Previous Law.

Legislative authority
This Law is made by the Ruler.

3.

Date of enactment
This Law is enacted on the date specified in the Enactment Notice in respect of this Law.

4.

Commencement
This Law comes into force on 1 July 2020.

5.

Purpose of this Law
The purpose of this Law is to:
(a)

provide standards and controls for the Processing and free movement of Personal Data by a
Controller or Processor; and

(b)

protect the fundamental rights of Data Subjects, including how such rights apply to the protection
of Personal Data in emerging technologies.

1

DATA PROTECTION LAW
6.

Application of the Law
(1)

This Law applies in the jurisdiction of the DIFC.

(2)

This Law applies to the Processing of Personal Data:

(3)

(a)

by automated means; and

(b)

other than by automated means where the Personal Data forms part of a Filing System or
is intended to form part of a Filing System.

This Law applies as follows:
(a)

This Law applies to the Processing of Personal Data by a Controller or Processor
incorporated in the DIFC, regardless of whether the Processing takes place in the DIFC or
not.

(b)

This Law applies to a Controller or Processor, regardless of its place of incorporation, that
Processes Personal Data in the DIFC as part of stable arrangements, other than on an
occasional basis. This Law applies to such Controller or Processor in the context of its
Processing activity in the DIFC (and not in a Third Country), including transfers of
Personal Data out of the DIFC.

(c)

For the purposes of this Article 6(3), Processing "in the DIFC" occurs when the means or
personnel used to conduct the Processing activity are physically located in the DIFC, and
Processing "outside the DIFC" is to be interpreted accordingly.

(4)

International Organisations,

that address regulating the transfer of Personal Data and include appropriate safeguards for the
relevant Data Subjects.
7.

Schedules
Schedule 1 contains:

8.

(a)

interpretative provisions that apply to this Law; and

(b)

a list of defined terms used in this Law.

Administration of the Law
This Law and any Regulations made under it are administered by the Commissioner.

Processed in accordance with Article 10;

(b)

Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to a Data Subject;

(c)

Processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes determined at the time of

Any one (1) or more of the following shall constitute a lawful basis for Processing Personal Data:
(a)

a Data Subject has given consent, which complies with Article 12, to the Processing of
that Personal Data for specific purposes;

(b)

Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which a Data Subject is a
party, or in order to take steps at the request of a Data Subject prior to entering into such
contract;

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(iii)

(f)

the exercise of powers or functions vested by a DIFC Body in a Third Party to
whom Personal Data is disclosed by the DIFC Body; or

Processing is necessary for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by a Controller or
a Third Party to whom the Personal Data has been made available, subject to Article 13,
except where such interests are overridden by the interests or rights of a Data Subject.

Part 2B: Processing of Special Categories of Personal Data
11.

Processing of Special Categories of Personal Data
In addition to general obligations set out in Article 9 and lawful Processing in accordance with a basis set
out in Article 10, and regardless of the Controller's other Processing obligations, Special Categories of
Personal Data shall not be Processed unless one (1) or more of the following applies:
(a)

a Data Subject has given explicit consent that complies with Article 12, to the Processing of those
Special Categories of Personal Data for one (1) or more specified purposes;

(b)

Processing is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the obligations and exercising the specific
rights of a Controller or a Data Subject in the context of the Data Subject's employment, including
but not limited to recruitment, visa or work permit processing, the performance of an employment
contract, termination of employment, the conduct of proceedings relating to employment and the
administration of a pension, retirement or employee money purchase benefit scheme;

(c)

Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a Data Subject or of another natural person,
where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;

(d)

Processing is carried out by a foundation, association or any other non-profit-seeking body in the
course of its legitimate activities, subject to appropriate assurances and provided that the Processing
relates:
(i)

solely to the members or former members of such an entity; or

(ii)

to other persons who have regular contact with such a body in connection with its purpose,

and the Personal Data is not disclosed to a Third Party without the consent of a Data Subject;
(e)

Processing relates to Personal Data that has been made public by a Data Subject;

(f)

Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (including,
without limitation, arbitration and other structured and commonly recognised alternative dispute
resolution procedures, such as mediation) or is performed by the Court acting in its judicial
capacity;

(g)

Processing is necessary for compliance with a specific requirement of Applicable Law to which a
Controller is subject, and in such circumstances the Controller must provide a Data Subject with
clear notice of such Processing as soon as reasonably practicable unless the obligation in question
prohibits such notice being given;

(h)

Processing is necessary to comply with Applicable Law that applies to a Controller in relation to
anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing obligations or the prevention, detection or
prosecution of any crime;

(i)

Processing is required for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, the assessment of
the working capacity of an employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or
the treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services, provided that the
Personal Data is processed by or under the responsibility of a health professional subject to an
obligation of professional secrecy under Applicable Law or by another person also subject to an
obligation of secrecy under Applicable Law;
4

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(j)

Processing is required for protecting members of the public against dishonesty, malpractice,
incompetence or other improper conduct of persons providing banking, insurance, investment,
management consultancy, information technology services, accounting or other services or
commercial activities (either in person or indirectly by means of outsourcing), including any
resulting financial loss; or

(k)

Processing is proportional and necessary to protect a Data Subject from potential bias or inaccurate
decision making, where such risk would be increased regardless of whether Special Category
Personal Data is Processed.

(l)

Processing is necessary for Substantial Public Interest reasons that are proportionate to the aim(s)
pursued, respect the principles of data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to
safeguard the rights of the Data Subject.

Part 2C: Conditions of consent and reliance on legitimate interests
12.

Consent
(1)

Consent must be freely given by a clear affirmative act that shows an unambiguous indication of
consent if it is to be relied on as a basis for Processing under Article 10(1)(a) or under Article
11(1)(a). If the performance of an act by a Controller, a Data Subject or any other party, (including
the performance of contractual obligations), is conditional on the provision of consent to Process
Personal Data, then such consent will not be considered to be freely given with respect to any
Processing that is not reasonably necessary for the performance of such act or where the consent
relates to excessive categories of Personal Data.

(2)

Where Processing is based on consent, a Controller must be able to demonstrate that consent has
been freely given.

(3)

If the Processing is intended to cover multiple purposes, consent must be obtained for each purpose
in a manner that is clearly distinguishable, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear
and plain language.

(4)

If a Controller seeks to obtain consent for one (1) or more other matters not expressly concerned
with the Processing of Personal Data, the request for consent for the Processing of Personal Data
must be clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form,
using clear and plain language.

(5)

A Data Subject may withdraw consent at any time in accordance with the right afforded to Data
Subjects under Article 32. A Data Subject must be informed of this right and how to exercise it as
set out in Article 40 at the time consent is obtained. Withdrawing consent should not require undue
effort on the part of the Data Subject and should be at least as easy as the process of giving consent.
Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of Processing carried out before the date of
withdrawal. Where consent is withdrawn a Controller must comply with Article 3232(3).

(6)

Other than for the purpose of a Single Discrete Incident, where a Controller relies on a Data
Subject’s consent for Processing, the Controller should implement appropriate and proportionate
measures to assess the ongoing validity of the consent. This includes considering whether the Data
Subject, acting reasonably, would expect Processing to continue based on the consent given, taking
into account the circumstances and the terms of such consent.

(7)

Where such ongoing assessment conducted in accordance with Article 12(6) concludes that a Data
Subject would no longer reasonably expect the Processing to be continuing, he must be contacted
without delay and asked to re-affirm consent.

(8)

In the circumstances referred to in Article 12(7), consent shall be deemed to be withdrawn if there
is no positive act of re-affirmation of consent within a reasonable period after a Data Subject has
been contacted.

5

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(9)

A Controller must be able to demonstrate to the Commissioner that appropriate methods and
procedures are in place to manage the recording of consent and the withdrawal of consent, and that
periodic evaluations of the same are conducted.

(10)

Where Processing is not a Single Discrete Incident and continues on the basis of consent, a Data
Subject should be given the opportunity to re-affirm or withdraw consent on a periodic basis.

(11)

A "Single Discrete Incident" means a Processing operation or a collection of Processing operations
that relate to a:
(a)

single, non-recurring transaction; or

(b)

non-recurring and clearly defined purpose that a Data Subject is seeking to achieve,

in each case, with a definable end point.
(12)

13.

For the avoidance of doubt, consent given for Processing to perform a Single Discrete Incident
remains subject to all foregoing provisions of this Article except for Article 12(6) and Article
12(10).

Legitimate interests
(1)

A public authority subject to DIFC law may not rely on the basis of legitimate interests under Article
10(1)(f) to Process Personal Data.

(2)

A Controller that is part of a Group may have a legitimate interest in transferring Personal Data
within its Group for internal administrative purposes.

(3)

Processing of Personal Data shall be considered a legitimate interest of a Controller if it is necessary
and proportionate to prevent fraud or ensure network and information security.

Part 2D: General requirements
14.

Accountability and notification
(1)

A Controller or Processor is required to establish a program to demonstrate compliance with this
Law, the level and detail of which will depend on the scale and resources of the Controller or the
Processor, the categories of Personal Data being Processed and the risks to the Data Subjects.

(2)

A Controller or Processor is required to implement appropriate technical and organisational
measures to demonstrate that Processing is performed in accordance with this Law, including:
(a)

(b)

taking into account:
(i)

the nature, scope, context and purpose of the Processing;

(ii)

the risks presented by the Processing to a relevant Data Subject; and

(iii)

prevailing information security good industry practice.

ensuring a level of security:
(i)

appropriate to the risks associated with Processing, taking account of any wilful,
negligent, accidental, unauthorised or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
disclosure of or access to Personal Data; and

(ii)

against all other unlawful forms of Processing;

6

DATA PROTECTION LAW

(3)

(4)

(5)

15.

(c)

ensuring that, by default, only Personal Data necessary for each specific purpose is
Processed. This obligation applies to the amount and type of Personal Data collected, the
extent of the Processing, the period of storage and accessibility; and

(d)

reviewing and updating such measures where necessary to reflect legal, operational and
technical developments.

A Controller or Processor shall integrate necessary measures into the Processing in order to meet
the requirements of this Law, protect a Data Subject’s rights and follow the principle of "data
protection by design and by default", which shall at least require assurances that:
(i)

Processing is designed to reinforce data protection principles such as data minimisation
at the time of determining the means for Processing and at the time of Processing itself;
and

(ii)

by default, only Personal Data that is necessary for each specific purpose is Processed,
and that Personal Data is not made accessible to an indefinite number of persons without
the Data Subject's intervention.

Where a Controller is offering online services through a platform, the default privacy preferences
of the platform shall be set such that no more than the minimum Personal Data necessary to deliver
or receive the relevant services is obtained or collected, and a Data Subject should be:
(a)

prompted to actively select his privacy preferences on first use; and

(b)

able to easily change such preferences.

A Controller or Processor that collects or Processes Personal Data shall implement and maintain a
data protection policy in writing that is:
(a)

proportionate to the extent and type of Processing of Personal Data undertaken; and

(b)

consistent with this Law.

(6)

Notwithstanding Article 14(5), any person that can demonstrate adherence to approved codes of
conduct under Article 48 or approved certification schemes under Article 50 has complied with the
obligations in this Article 14.

(7)

A Controller or Processor shall register with the Commissioner by filing a notification of Processing
operations, which shall be kept up to date through amended notifications.

(8)

Notifications referred to in Article 14(7) shall be:
(a)

kept on a publicly available register maintained by the Commissioner; and

(b)

accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed in Regulations made by the DIFCA Board
of Directors.

Records of Processing activities
(1)

A Controller shall maintain a written record, which may be in electronic form, of Processing
activities under its responsibility, which shall contain at least the following information:
(a)

name and contact details of the Controller, its appointed DPO, where applicable, and Joint
Controller, if any;

(b)

the purpose(s) of the Processing;

(c)

a description of the categories of Data Subjects;
7

DATA PROTECTION LAW

16.

17.

(d)

a description of the categories of Personal Data;

(e)

categories of recipients to whom the Personal Data has been or will be disclosed, including
recipients in Third Countries and International Organisations;

(f)

where applicable, the identification of the Third Country or International Organisation that
the Personal Data has or will be transferred to and, in the case of transfers under Article
27, the documentation of suitable safeguards;

(g)

where possible, the time limits for erasure of the different categories of Personal Data; and

(h)

where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures
referred to in Article 14(2).

(2)

A Processor shall maintain a written record of all categories of Processing activities carried out on
behalf of a Controller containing the information specified in Article 15(1).

(3)

The DIFCA Board of Directors may make Regulations on the procedures relating to recording of
Processing activities under this Article 15.

Designation of the DPO
(1)

A Controller or Processor may elect to appoint a DPO that meets the requirements of Article 17.

(2)

Notwithstanding Article 16(1), a DPO shall be appointed by:
(a)

DIFC Bodies, other than the Courts acting in their judicial capacity; and

(b)

a Controller or Processor performing High Risk Processing Activities on a systematic or
regular basis.

(3)

A Controller or Processor to which Article 16(2)(b) does not apply may be required to designate a
DPO by the Commissioner.

(4)

If a Controller or Processor is not required to appoint a DPO, it shall clearly allocate responsibility
for oversight and compliance with respect to data protection duties and obligations under this Law,
or any other applicable data protection law, within its organisation and be able to provide details of
the persons with such responsibility to the Commissioner upon request.

(5)

The role of a DPO may be performed by a member of a Controller’s or Processor’s staff, an
individual employed within a Controller’s or Processor’s Group in accordance with Article 16(6)
or by a third party under a service contract.

(6)

A Group may appoint a single DPO provided that he is easily accessible from each entity in the
Group.

(7)

A DPO must reside in the UAE unless he is an individual employed within the organisation's Group
and performs a similar function for the Group on an international basis.

(8)

A Controller or Processor shall publish the contact details of its DPO in a manner that is readily
accessible to third parties, such that a third party could determine how to contact the DPO without
disproportionate effort. On request, a Controller or Processor shall confirm identity of its DPO to
the Commissioner in writing.

The DPO: competencies and status

A Controller or Processor shall ensure that:
(a)

its DPO is properly involved in a timely manner, on all issues relating to the protection of
Personal Data and is given sufficient resources necessary to carry out the role;

(b)

its DPO is free to act independently; and

(c)

undertake an assessment of the Controller's Processing activities, at least once per year ("the Annual
Assessment"), which shall be submitted to the Commissioner.

(2)

A Controller shall report on its Processing activities in the Annual Assessment and indicate whether
it intends to perform High Risk Processing Activities in the following annual period.

(3)

The Commissioner shall prescribe and make publically available the format, required content and
deadline for submission of Annual Assessments.

Data protection impact assessment
(1)

Prior to undertaking High Risk Processing Activities a Controller shall carry out an assessment of
the impact of the proposed Processing operations on the protection of Personal Data, considering
the risks to the rights of the Data Subjects concerned. A Controller may also elect to carry out such
assessment in relation to the Processing of Personal Data that is not a High Risk Processing Activity.

(2)

A single assessment may address a set of similar Processing operations that present similar risks. If
another member of a Controller's Group has conducted a data protection impact assessment,
complying with the requirements of Article 20(6), in relation to substantially the same Processing
that remains current and accurate, the Controller may rely on such data protection impact
assessment for the purpose of this Article 20.

(3)

A DPO, where appointed, shall be responsible for overseeing data protection impact assessments.

(4)

The Commissioner may at his discretion publish a non-exhaustive list of types or categories of
Processing operations that are considered to be High Risk Processing Activities. Such a list is not
intended to be exhaustive and does not absolve a Controller from responsibility for complying with
this Law in all respects with regard to High Risk Processing Activities.

(5)

The Commissioner may also publish a list of the types or categories of Processing operations for
which no data protection impact assessment is required.

(6)

A data protection impact assessment shall contain at least:
(a)

a systematic description of the foreseen Processing operations and the purpose(s) of the
Processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by a Controller;

(b)

an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the Processing operations in relation
to the purpose(s);

(c)

identification and consideration of the lawful basis for the Processing, including:
(i)

where legitimate interests are the basis for Processing, an analysis and
explanation of why a Controller believes the interests or rights of a Data Subject
do not override its interests; and

(ii)

where consent is the basis for Processing, validation that such consent is validly
obtained, consideration of the impact of the withdrawal of consent to such

10

DATA PROTECTION LAW
Processing and of how a Controller will ensure compliance with the exercise of
a Data Subject's right to withdraw consent;
an assessment of the risks to the rights of Data Subjects; and

(e)

the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and
mechanisms to ensure the protection of Personal Data and to demonstrate compliance with
this Law, taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of Data Subjects and other
concerned persons.

(7)

In assessing the impact of the Processing operations, compliance with approved codes of conduct
referred to in Article 48 by a Controller or Processor shall be taken into account.

(8)

Taking into account protection of commercial or public interests or the security of Processing
operations, a Controller shall seek the input of Data Subjects or their representatives on the intended
Processing, where appropriate.

(9)

A new data protection impact assessment is not required unless Applicable Law requires that it is
necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to undertaking Processing activities, where:

(10)

(11)

21.

(d)

(a)

Processing pursuant to Articles 10(1)(c) or 10(1)(e) has a lawful basis in Applicable Law
to which a Controller is subject;

(b)

Applicable Law regulates the specific Processing operation or set of operations in
question; and

(c)

a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact
assessment in the context of the adoption of that lawful basis.

A Controller shall carry out a review to assess if Processing is performed in accordance with a data
protection impact assessment:
(a)

on a regular basis, proportionate to the extent and type of Processing the Controller
conducts; or

(b)

when there is a change in the risk related to the Processing operations.

A Processor appointed, or in the process of being appointed, by a Controller to carry out a
Processing activity shall assist the Controller by providing all information reasonably requested by
the Controller in connection with the relevant data protection impact assessment.

Prior consultation
(1)

A Controller shall consult the Commissioner where a data protection impact assessment under
Article 20 indicates that, despite taking the measures referred to in Article 20(6)(e), the risks to the
rights of Data Subjects remain particularly high and the Controller has already carried out or wishes
to commence or continue carrying out a Processing activity.

(2)

Where the Commissioner determines that a Processing activity referred to in Article 21(1) would
or does breach this Law, the Commissioner shall provide written confirmation to the Controller
and, where applicable, to the Processor, and may also use any of the powers referred to in Article
46.

(3)

A Controller may consult with the Commissioner before commencing a Processing activity. A
Controller is not prohibited from commencing a Processing activity before or during a consultation
period where there is insufficient time to complete such consultation in advance and there is a
pressing business need to commence Processing, provided it is not likely to override the vital
interests of Data Subjects whose Personal Data is being Processed. Such Processing shall comply

11

DATA PROTECTION LAW
with the Law at all times and the Controller shall remain liable for breaches of the Law prior to or
during the consultation period.
(4)

If the Commissioner makes a direction with respect to a Processing activity as a result of a
consultation then a Controller shall implement such directions without delay including, if so
directed, discontinuing the Processing activity.

(5)

A Controller's decision regarding a consultation will be taken into account by the Commissioner
when considering any applicable sanctions under this Law. Where Processing is determined to be
in violation of the Law, a failure to consult with the Commissioner may result in the application of
more severe penalties.

(6)

A Controller may complete a data protection impact assessment or carry out prior consultation with
other Controllers or Joint Controllers (as applicable), including where multiple Controllers wish to
use a new technology or platform, or where there is an innovation in a particular industry that
changes the way Personal Data is Processed.

(7)

The Commissioner shall endeavour to provide its written confirmation within four (4) weeks of the
beginning of the consultation period, but may notify a relevant Controller that the time period is
being extended by up to a further four (4) weeks where the Processing in question is particularly
complex.

(8)

Where the Commissioner determines that the Processing is unlawful, a relevant Controller or
Processor shall cease all such Processing immediately, unless otherwise directed by the
Commissioner.

(9)

When consulting with the Commissioner pursuant to Article 21(1), a Controller shall provide the
Commissioner with:

(10)

22.

(a)

where applicable, its respective responsibilities and those of any Joint Controllers and
Processors involved in the Processing, in particular for Processing within a Group;

(b)

the purposes and means of the intended Processing;

(c)

the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights of Data Subjects pursuant to
this Law;

(d)

where applicable, the contact details of its DPO;

(e)

the relevant data protection impact assessment; and

(f)

any other information requested by the Commissioner.

A Processor appointed, or in the process of being appointed, by a Controller to carry out a
Processing activity shall assist the Controller in any prior consultation process with the
Commissioner.

Cessation of Processing
(1)

Where the basis for Processing changes, ceases to exist or a Controller is required to cease
Processing due to the exercise of a Data Subject’s rights, the Controller shall ensure that all Personal
Data, including Personal Data held by Processors is:
(a)

securely and permanently deleted;

(b)

anonymised so that the data is no longer Personal Data and no Data Subject can be
identified from the data including where the data is lost, damaged or accidentally released;

(c)

pseudonymised;
12

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(d)

securely encrypted; or

(2)

Where a Controller is unable to ensure that Personal Data is securely and permanently deleted,
anonymised, pseudonynmised or securely encrypted, the Personal Data must be archived in a
manner that ensures the data is put beyond further use.

(3)

"Put beyond further use" in Article 22(2) means that:

(4)

(a)

a Controller and a relevant Processor is unable to use the Personal Data to inform any
decision with respect of the Data Subject or in a manner that affects the Data Subject in
any way, other than where such Personal Data needs to be cross-checked by automated
means solely in order to prevent further Processing of Personal Data related to the Data
Subject;

(b)

no party has access to the Personal Data other than the Controller and any relevant
Processor;

(c)

Personal Data is protected by appropriate technical and organisational security measures
that are equivalent to those afforded to live Personal Data; and

(d)

a Controller and any relevant Processor have in place and must comply with a strategy for
the permanent deletion, anonymisation, pseudonymisation or secure encryption of the
Personal Data, complies and can demonstrate compliance with such policy.

Notwithstanding Article 22(1), a Controller and any relevant Processor is not required to securely
and permanently delete, anonymise, pseudonymise or encrypt Personal Data or put it beyond further
use, where such Personal Data:
(a)

is necessary for the establishment or defence of legal claims or must be retained for
compliance with Applicable Law; or

(b)

is being used in scientific research activity conducted in the public interest or in the
interests of the DIFC in accordance with all Applicable Laws, in a manner that does not
present risks to the rights of Data Subjects; or

(c)

is part of a dataset used to lawfully train or refine an artificial intelligence system in a
manner that does not present risks to a Data Subject’s rights.

(5)

A Controller or Processor seeking to rely on Articles 22(4)(b) or 22(4)(c) shall conduct a data
protection impact assessment in accordance with Article 20 before doing so. Any Processing of
Personal Data in accordance with Article 22(4) must be limited to the extent necessary for such
purposes.

(6)

A Controller or Processor shall have a policy and process for managing Personal Data that is subject
to Article 22(4) when the grounds for retention no longer apply, and shall securely and permanently
delete, anonymise, pseudonymise, encrypt Personal Data or to put it beyond further use when such
grounds no longer apply.

PART 3: JOINT CONTROLLERS AND PROCESSORS
Part 3A: Joint Controllers
23.

Joint Controllers
(1)

Where two (2) or more persons jointly determine the purposes and means of Processing Personal
Data, they shall be Joint Controllers.

(2)

Joint Controllers shall, by way of legally binding written agreement, define their respective
responsibilities for ensuring compliance with the obligations under this Law. Such agreement shall
clarify the process for ensuring that a Data Subject can exercise his rights under this Law and for
providing a Data Subject with the information referred to in Articles 29 and 30.

(3)

The written agreement referred to in Article 23(2) or an appropriate summary shall be made
available to an affected Data Subject.

(4)

Notwithstanding the terms of any written agreement between the Joint Controllers, they shall
remain responsible for all Controller obligations under this Law and the Data Subject’s rights may
be exercised under this Law in respect of and against each of the Joint Controllers.

Part 3B: Processors
24.

Processors and Sub-processors
(1)

Where Processing is to be carried out on behalf of a Controller by a Processor, the Processing shall
be governed by a legally binding written agreement between the Controller and the Processor. A
Controller shall only enter into agreements with Processors that provide sufficient assurances to
implement appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure the Processing meets the
requirements of this Law and protects a Data Subject’s rights.

(2)

A Processor may not engage another Processor to act as a Sub-processor without the prior written
authorisation of a Controller. A Controller may only give a general written authorisation where it
has ensured that conditions are in place to enable appointed Sub-processors (present or future) to
provide the assurances under Article 24(1). If a general written authorisation has been given, a
Processor shall inform a Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement
of a Sub-processor. A Processor shall take into account any good faith objection raised by a
Controller to such intended changes.

(3)

Subject to Article 24(2), a Processor may not engage a Sub-processor for carrying out specific
Processing activities on behalf of the Controller, unless a legally binding written agreement
containing the requirements set out in Article 24(5) is in place with such Sub-processor that ensures
a full delegation of the obligations that the Processor owes to the Controller under the agreement
with the Controller in respect of such specific Processing activities.

(4)

Where a Sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under an agreement or
Applicable Law, the Processor that engaged it shall remain fully liable to a relevant Controller for
the performance of the Sub-processor's obligations.

(5)

Each agreement referred to in Articles 24(1) and 24(3):
(a)

shall set out the:
(i)

subject-matter and duration of the Processing;

(ii)

nature and purpose of the Processing;

(iii)

type of Personal Data and categories of Data Subjects; and

14

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(iv)
(b)

(6)

obligations and rights of the Controller; and

must include commitments that each Processor and Sub-processor (if any) shall:
(i)

Process Personal Data based on documented instructions from a Controller,
including sharing of Personal Data in response to a request made by a Requesting
Authority (as described in Article 28), or transfers of Personal Data to a Third
Country or an International Organisation, unless required to do so by Applicable
Law to which the Processor is subject;

(ii)

where Applicable Law, as referred to in Article 24(5)(b)(i), applies:
(A)

inform any relevant counterparty; or

(B)

where there is a chain of Processors and Sub-processors, ensure that the
Controller is notified, unless the Applicable Law in question prohibits
such information being provided on grounds of Substantial Public
Interest;

(iii)

ensure that persons authorised to Process relevant Personal Data are under legally
binding written agreements or duties of confidentiality;

(iv)

take all measures required pursuant to Article 14;

(v)

comply with the conditions referred to in Articles 24(2) and (3) for engaging any
Sub-processor;

(vi)

assist a relevant counterparty by providing appropriate technical and
organisational measures for the fulfilment of the Controller's obligation to
respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject's rights, having taken into
account the nature of the Processing;

(vii)

assist a relevant counterparty in ensuring the Controller's compliance with the
obligations pursuant to Articles 14, 20, 21, 41 and 42, taking into account the
nature of Processing and the information available to the Processor;

(viii)

delete or return all Personal Data to the Controller, at the Controller’s option, or
make the same available for return to a relevant counterparty after the end of the
provision of services relating to Processing, and delete existing copies unless
Applicable Law requires storage of the Personal Data;

(ix)

make available to the Controller, relevant counterparty or the Commissioner
(upon request) all necessary information to demonstrate compliance with the
obligations in this Article 24; and

(x)

permit and provide reasonable assistance with audits, including inspections,
conducted by:
(A)

a relevant counterparty;

(B)

another auditor mandated by a relevant counterparty; or

(C)

the Commissioner.

A Processor or Sub-processor shall immediately inform the Controller or Processor (as applicable)
whether, in its opinion, the Processing activity infringes this Law.

15

DATA PROTECTION LAW

25.

(7)

Adherence by a Processor or Sub-processor to an approved code of conduct referred to in Article
48, or an approved certification mechanism referred to in Article 50, may demonstrate the
sufficiency of the measures referred to in Articles 24(1) and 24(2).

(8)

The Commissioner may publish standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in Articles
24(1) and (3). The incorporation of such clauses in an applicable written agreement shall be
sufficient to discharge the obligations in Articles 24(5)(b)(i) to 24(5)(b)(x) inclusive.

(9)

If a Processor infringes this Law by determining the purposes and means of Processing, the
Processor shall be considered to be a Controller in respect of that Processing and will assume all
the responsibilities and obligations of a Controller.

(10)

Both a Controller and Processor are in breach of this Law if they commence mutually agreed
Processing activity without a written agreement referred to in Articles 24(1) and 24(3).

Confidentiality
A Controller or Processor, and where applicable, a Joint Controller or a Sub-processor, shall take steps to
ensure that any person acting under its respective authority that has access to Personal Data shall not Process
it except on the instructions of the Controller, unless it is required to do so under Applicable Law.

PART 4: DATA EXPORT AND SHARING
26.

Transfers out of the DIFC: adequate level of protection
(1)

(2)

27.

Processing of Personal Data that involves the transfer of Personal Data from the DIFC to a Third
Country or to an International Organisation may take place only if:
(a)

an adequate level of protection for that Personal Data is ensured by Applicable Law, as set
out in Articles 26(2) and (3), including with respect to onward transfers of Personal Data;
or

(b)

it takes place in accordance with Article 27.

For the purposes of Article 26(1), the Commissioner may determine from time to time that a Third
Country, a territory or one (1) or more specified sectors within a Third Country, or an International
Organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection, taking into account factors including:
(a)

the rule of law, the general respect for individual's rights and the ability of individuals to
enforce their rights via administrative or judicial redress;

(b)

the access of a public authority to Personal Data;

(c)

the existence of effective data protection law, including rules on the onward transfer of
Personal Data to a Third Country or International Organisation;

(d)

the existence and functioning of one (1) or more independent, competent data protection
or similar supervisory authorities with adequate enforcement powers; and

(e)

international commitments and conventions binding on such Third Country or
International Organisation and its membership of any multilateral or regional
organisations.

(3)

The Commissioner may, at his discretion, make such a determination that any Third Country, a
territory or one (1) or more specified sectors within a Third Country, or an International
Organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection based on adequacy decisions made by
other competent data protection authorities where such decisions have taken into account the same
factors listed at Article 26(2)(a) to (e) above.

(4)

The Commissioner shall pass Regulations to provide details of his determinations under Article
26(2) and 26(3).

(5)

The Commissioner may repeal, amend or suspend the adequacy status of any Third Country,
territory or one (1) or more specified sectors within a Third Country, or International Organisation
determined under Article 26(2). In such circumstances, the Commissioner will issue amended
Regulations if necessary.

(6)

Processing in accordance with this Article 26 does not require any specific authorisation or
notification to the Commissioner other than as required under any other provision of this Law which
may apply to such Processing.

Transfers out of the DIFC in the absence of an adequate level of protection
(1)

A transfer or a set of transfers of Personal Data to a Third Country or an International Organisation
may take place on condition that:
(a)

the Controller or Processor in question has provided appropriate safeguards (as described
in Article 27(2)), and on condition that enforceable Data Subject rights and effective legal
remedies for Data Subjects are available;

17

DATA PROTECTION LAW

(2)

(3)

(b)

one of the specific derogations in Article 27(3) applies; or

(c)

the limited circumstances in Article 27(4) apply.

a legally binding instrument between public authorities;

(b)

Binding Corporate Rules, subject to Article 27(6);

(c)

standard data protection clauses as adopted by the Commissioner in accordance with
Regulations setting out a procedure for developing such clauses;

(d)

an approved code of conduct pursuant to Article 48 together with binding and enforceable
commitments of the Controller or Processor in the Third Country or the International
Organisation to apply the appropriate safeguards, including regarding a Data Subject’s
rights; or

(e)

an approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 50 together with binding and
enforceable commitments of the Controller or Processor in the Third Country or the
International Organisation to apply the appropriate safeguards, including regarding Data
Subjects' rights.

The derogations referred to in Article 27(1)(b) are:
(a)

a Data Subject has explicitly consented to a proposed transfer, after being informed of
possible risks of such transfer due to the absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate
safeguards;

(b)

the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between a Data Subject and
Controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to the Data
Subject's request;

(c)

the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract that is in the
interest of a Data Subject between a Controller and a Third Party;

(d)

the transfer is necessary for reasons of Substantial Public Interest;

(e)

the transfer is necessary or legally required in the interests of the DIFC, including in the
interests of the DIFC Bodies relating to the proper discharge of their functions;

(f)

the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim;

(g)

the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of a Data Subject or of other
persons where a Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;

(h)

the transfer is made in compliance with Applicable Law and data minimisation principles,
set out in Article 9(1)(e), from a register that is:

(i)

(i)

intended to provide information to the public; and

(ii)

open for viewing either by the public in general or by any person who can
demonstrate a legitimate interest;

subject to Article 28, the transfer is:

or competent authority;

(j)

subject to international financial standards, the transfer is necessary to uphold the
legitimate interests of a Controller recognised in international financial markets, except
where such interests are overridden by the legitimate interests of the Data Subject relating
to the Data Subject's particular situation; or

(k)

the transfer is necessary to comply with applicable anti-money laundering or counterterrorist financing obligations that apply to a Controller or Processor or for the prevention
or detection of a crime.

Where a transfer could not be based on one of the provisions in this Article 27(1) to (3) or Article
26, such transfer to a Third Country or an International Organisation may take place only if:
(a)

the transfer is not repeating or part of a repetitive course of transfers;

(b)

concerns only a limited number of Data Subjects;

(c)

is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the Controller
that are not overridden by the interests or rights of the Data Subject; and

(d)

the Controller has completed a documentary assessment of all the circumstances
surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable
safeguards with regard to the protection of Personal Data.

(5)

A Controller shall inform the Commissioner of any transfer made pursuant to Article 27(4) and
shall, in addition to providing the information referred to in Articles 29 or 30, as applicable, inform
the Data Subject of the transfer and the compelling legitimate interests.

(6)

A public authority subject to DIFC law may not rely on Articles 27(3)(a), (b) and (c), or on Article
27(4).

(7)

A Controller or Processor may rely on its existing Binding Corporate Rules subject to the following:

(8)

(a)

relevant Binding Corporate Rules may only be used for lawful transfers within the
Controller's or the Processor's respective Group (and, in the case of the Processor, only
where permitted by the Controller); and

(b)

relevant Binding Corporate Rules must have been reviewed and approved by the
Commissioner.

A Controller or Processor may make a request to the Commissioner for approval of its Binding
Corporate Rules that have been approved by a competent data protection or similar supervisory
authority in any jurisdiction to which Article 26(2) applies, and the Commissioner shall approve or
reject such request, which shall include:
(i)

a full copy of its Binding Corporate Rules and confirmation as to whether such Binding
Corporate Rules have been approved by any competent data protection authority;

(ii)

details of the transfers it intends to make or receive in reliance on the Binding Corporate
Rules; and

(iii)

where the Binding Corporate Rules operate on the basis that members of the Controller's
or Processor’s Group (including the Controller or Processor) will bind other members of
the Group, such as by way of power of attorney, full evidence of all valid instruments
necessary to create such powers to bind should also be provided.

19

DATA PROTECTION LAW

28.

(9)

If a set of Binding Corporate Rules is amended at any time, a Controller or Processor shall provide
a revised copy to the Commissioner without delay, in a form that clearly shows all edits. The
Commissioner may approve or reject the revised Binding Corporate Rules. If the revised Binding
Corporate Rules are rejected then the Controller or Processor may no longer rely on them.

(10)

A Controller or Processor shall confirm in writing annually to the Commissioner that an approved
set of Binding Corporate Rules remains in the same form and is used to facilitate the same transfers
as approved.

(11)

The Commissioner may provide guidance or make Regulations regarding the procedure for
approving or rejecting and suggested contents of Binding Corporate Rules, and may require a
Controller or Processor to provide evidence of any matter relating to Binding Corporate Rules.

(2)

(3)

Subject to any other obligations under this Law and, in particular, a Controller’s or Processor’s
obligations under Part 2 regarding accountability, transparency and compliance with general data
protection principles or Part 4 regarding transfers out of the DIFC, where a Controller or Processor
receives a request from any public authority over the person or any part of its Group ("a Requesting
Authority") for the disclosure and transfer of any Personal Data, it should:
(a)

exercise reasonable caution and diligence to determine the validity and proportionality of
the request, including to ensure that any disclosure of Personal Data in such circumstances
is made solely for the purpose of meeting the objectives identified in the request from the
Requesting Authority;

(b)

affected Data Subject and, where appropriate, implement measures to minimise such risks,
including by redacting or minimising the Personal Data transferred to the extent possible
or utilising appropriate technical or other measures to safeguard the transfer; and

(c)

where reasonably practicable, obtain appropriate written and binding assurances from the
Requesting Authority that it will respect the rights of Data Subjects and comply with the
general data protection principles set out in Part 2 in relation to the Processing of Personal
Data by the Requesting Authority.

A Controller or, as applicable, its Processor(s) or any Sub-processor(s), having provided (where
possible under Applicable Law) reasonable notice to the Controller, may disclose or transfer
Personal Data to the Requesting Authority where it has taken reasonable steps to satisfy itself that:
(a)

a request by a Requesting Authority referred to in Article 28(1) is valid and proportionate;
and

(b)

the Requesting Authority will respect the rights of Data Subjects in the Processing of any
Personal Data transferred to it by the Controller pursuant to a request under Article 28(1).

A Controller or Processor may consult with the Commissioner in relation to any matter under this
Article 28.

means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available; and

(g)

any necessary information regarding the specific circumstances in which the Personal Data
is Processed, to ensure fair and transparent Processing in respect of the Data Subject,
including:
(i)

the period for which the Personal Data will be stored, or if that is not possible,
the criteria used to determine that period;

(ii)

if the Controller's lawful basis for the Processing is legitimate interests or
compliance with any Applicable Law to which the Controller is subject, the
Controller shall state clearly what those legitimate interests or compliance
obligations are;

(iii)

notice of the right to request from the Controller access to and rectification or
erasure of Personal Data or restriction of Processing concerning the Data Subject

(2)

(3)

31.

if applicable, the existence of automated decision-making, including Profiling,
and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance
and the possible outcomes of such Processing for the Data Subject.

The Controller must provide the information referred to in Article 30(1):
(a)

no longer than one (1) month from obtaining the Personal Data; or

(b)

if the Personal Data is used for communicating with the Data Subject, no later than the
first communication; or

(c)

if a disclosure (including the making available for Processing) to a Processor or a Third
Party is envisaged, no later than the time when the Personal Data is first disclosed.

Article 30(1) shall not apply:
(a)

to require the Controller to provide information the Data Subject already has;

(b)

to require the provision of such information if it proves impossible or would involve a
disproportionate effort.

(c)

where disclosure is expressly required by a Requesting Authority or an Applicable Law
and which provides appropriate measures to protect the Data Subject’s legitimate interests;
or

(d)

where the Personal Data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional
secrecy in accordance with Applicable Law to which the Controller is subject, including a
statutory obligation of secrecy.

Nature of Processing information
(1)

Subject to Article 31(2), the information to be provided under Articles 29 and 30 shall be provided
in writing, including, where appropriate, by electronic means.

(2)

The information to be provided under Articles 29 and 30 may be provided orally upon a Data
Subject’s request, including where the Personal Data is being collected by means of a telephone
conversation between the Controller and the Data Subject, on the condition that the identity of the
Data Subject has been verified at the time of the request.

(3)

A Controller may comply with the requirements under Articles 29 and 30, to the extent that the
required information is contained within publicly available policies maintained by the Controller,
by clearly directing the Data Subject to such policies. Such policies must be written in a concise,
transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. The Controller
may include within such policies links directing the Data Subject to additional information about
the Processing.

23

DATA PROTECTION LAW
PART 6: RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS
32.

33.

Right to withdraw consent
(1)

Where the basis for the Processing of Personal Data is consent under Article 10(1)(a) or under
Article 11(1)(a), the Data Subject may withdraw consent at any time by notifying the Controller in
accordance with Article 12(5). Where a Controller has not complied with Article 12(5) a Data
Subject may notify the Controller by any reasonable means.

(2)

The right to withdraw consent is an absolute right available to a Data Subject if the basis for the
Processing of the Data Subject’s Personal Data is consent under Article 10(1)(a) or Article 11(1)(a).

(3)

Upon the exercise of a Data Subject's right to withdraw consent, a Controller must comply with
Article 22 and must cease Processing the Personal Data as soon as reasonably practicable, and
ensure that any Processors do the same.

Rights to access, rectification and erasure of Personal Data
(1)

(2)

(3)

Upon request, a Data Subject has the right to obtain from a Controller without charge and within
one (1) month of the request:
(a)

confirmation in writing as to whether or not Personal Data relating to him is being
Processed and information at least as to the purposes of the Processing, the categories of
Personal Data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the
Personal Data are disclosed;

(b)

a copy of the Personal Data undergoing Processing in electronic form and of any available
information as to its source, including up-to-date information corresponding with the
information requirements set out in Articles 29 and 30; and

(c)

subject to Article 33(4), the rectification of Personal Data unless it is not technically
feasible to do so.

Subject to Article 33(3), the Data Subject has the right to require the Controller to erase the Data
Subject's Personal Data where:
(a)

the Processing of the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for
which it was collected;

(b)

a Data Subject has withdrawn consent to the Processing where consent was the lawful
basis for Processing and there is no other lawful basis, provided that in such circumstances
the Controller must comply with Article 22;

(c)

the Processing is unlawful or the Personal Data is required to be deleted to comply with
Applicable Law to which the Controller is subject; or

(d)

the Data Subject objects to the Processing and there is no overriding legitimate grounds
for the Controller to continue with the Processing.

The Controller is only required to comply with a request by a Data Subject to erase Personal Data
where:
(a)

one of the conditions in Article 33(2) applies; and

(b)

subject to Article 33(4), the Controller is not required to retain the Personal Data in
compliance with Applicable Law to which it is subject or for the establishment or defence
of legal claims.

24

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(4)

Where rectification or erasure of Personal Data is not feasible for technical reasons, then the
Controller is not in violation of this Law for failing to comply with a request for rectification or
erasure of the Personal Data, in accordance with Articles 33(1)(c), 33(2)(a) or Article 33(2)(d) as
applicable, if:
(a)

the Controller collected the Personal Data from the Data Subject; and

(b)

the information provided to the Data Subject under Article 29(1)(h)(ix) was explicit, clear
and prominent with respect to the manner of Processing the Personal Data and expressly
stated that rectification or erasure (as the case may be) of the Personal Data at the request
of the Data Subject would not be feasible.

(5)

Where a Data Subject suffers adverse effects as a result of the inability of a Controller to rectify
Personal Data and where the need for rectification was not caused by the Data Subject's own
provision of inaccurate data, the Controller shall provide all reasonable assistance to the Data
Subject to enable the Data Subject to take steps to mitigate the adverse effects.

(6)

A Controller shall direct all recipients and Processors to rectify or erase Personal Data where the
respective right is properly exercised or to cease Processing and return or erase the Personal Data
where the right to object is validly exercised. In such circumstances, Article 22 applies to the erasure
of the Personal Data by both the Controller and the Processor.

(7)

If a Data Subject request under Article 33(1) is particularly complex, or requests are numerous, the
Controller may send notice to the Data Subject, within one (1) month, to increase the period for
compliance by a further two (2) months citing the reasons for the delay.

(8)

Where requests from a Data Subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because
of their repetitive character, the Controller may either:
(a)

charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the
information or communication or taking the action requested; or

(b)

refuse to act on the request, providing written confirmation to the Data Subject reasons for
the refusal.

(9)

A Controller must be able to demonstrate to the Commissioner upon request that a Data Subject’s
request made in accordance with Article 33(8) is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

(10)

If a Controller has reasonable doubts as to the identity of a Data Subject asserting a right under this
Article 33, it may require the Data Subject to provide additional information sufficient to confirm
the individual’s identity. In such cases, the time period for complying with the Data Subject request
does not begin until the Controller has received information or evidence sufficient to reasonably
identify that the person making the request is the Data Subject.

(11)

Where a Controller complies with a request under Article 33(1)(b) it shall not disclose the Personal
Data of other individuals in a way that may infringe their rights under Applicable Law and the
Controller may redact or otherwise obscure Personal Data relating to such other individuals. Where
the Data Subject's request is received by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the
Data Subject, the information may be provided in a commonly used electronic form.

(12)

The information to be supplied pursuant to a request under this Article 33 must be supplied by
reference to the data in question at the time the request is received, except that it may take account
of any amendment or deletion made between that time and the time when the information is
supplied, being an amendment or deletion that would have been made regardless of the receipt of
the request.

(13)

Without derogating from the requirements on DIFC Bodies as set out in Article 65(2), a Controller
may restrict, wholly or partly, the provision of information to the Data Subject under Article 33(1)

25

DATA PROTECTION LAW
to the extent that and for so long as the restriction is, having regard to the fundamental rights and
legitimate interests of the Data Subject, a necessary and proportionate measure to:

(14)

(15)

34.

(a)

avoid obstructing an official or legal inquiry, investigation or procedure;

(b)

avoid prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal
offences or the execution of criminal penalties;

(c)

protect public security;

(d)

protect national security; or

(e)

protect the rights of others.

Where the provision of information to a Data Subject under Article 33(1) is restricted in accordance
with Article 33(13), a Controller must inform the Data Subject in writing without undue delay:
(a)

that the provision of information has been restricted;

(b)

of the reasons for the restriction;

(c)

of the Data Subject’s right to lodge a complaint with the Commissioner under Article 60;
and

(d)

of the Data Subject’s right to apply to the Court under Article 63.

Article 33(14)(a) and (b) do not apply to the extent that complying with them would undermine the
purpose of the restriction.

Right to object to Processing
(1)

A Data Subject has the right to:
(a)

object at any time on reasonable grounds relating to his particular situation to Processing
of Personal Data relating to him where such Processing is carried out on the basis that:
(i)

it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
in the exercise of official authority vested in a Controller; or

(ii)

it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests, where applicable, of a
Controller or of a Third Party; and

(b)

be informed before Personal Data is disclosed for the first time to third parties or used on
their behalf for the purposes of direct marketing, and to be expressly offered the right to
object to such disclosures or uses, subject to any provision of this Law that does not permit
disclosure; and

(c)

where Personal Data is Processed for direct marketing purposes, object at any time to such
Processing, including Profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

(2)

Where there is a justified objection, Processing initiated by a Controller shall no longer include that
Personal Data, and Article 22 shall apply with respect to such Personal Data. An objection under
Article 34(1)(a) is deemed justified unless the Controller can demonstrate compelling grounds for
such Processing that overrides the interests, rights of a Data Subject or that the circumstances in
Article 34(3) apply.

(3)

If a Controller collected Personal Data from a Data Subject and the Controller can demonstrate that
the information provided to the Data Subject under Article 29(1)(h)(ix) was explicit, clear and
prominent with respect to the manner of Processing the Personal Data and expressly stated that it
26

DATA PROTECTION LAW
would not be possible to implement an objection to the Processing at the request of the Data Subject,
then the Controller may continue Processing the Personal Data in the same manner, subject to this
Law in all other respects.
(4)

35.

Right to restriction of Processing
(1)

36.

A Controller shall, no later than its first communication to a Data Subject, explicitly bring to the
attention of the Data Subject in clear language that is prominent and separate from other
communications or information, the rights referred to in Article 34(1).

Subject to Article 35(3), a Data Subject shall have the right to require a Controller to restrict
Processing to the extent that any of the following circumstances apply:
(a)

the accuracy of the Personal Data is contested by the Data Subject, for a period allowing
the Controller to verify the accuracy of the Personal Data;

(b)

the Processing is unlawful and the Data Subject opposes the erasure of the Personal Data
and requests the restriction of its use instead;

(c)

the Controller no longer needs the Personal Data for the purposes of the Processing, but
they are required by the Data Subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
claims;

(d)

the Data Subject has objected to Processing pursuant to Article 34 pending verification of
whether the legitimate grounds of the Controller override those of the Data Subject.

(2)

If a Controller lifts the period of restriction it shall inform the Data Subject in writing.

(3)

Where Article 35(1) applies, the only Processing that may continue to be conducted without the
consent of the Data Subject is:
(a)

storage of the Personal Data concerned;

(b)

Processing of the Personal Data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;

(c)

Processing for the protection of the rights of another person; and

(d)

Processing for reasons of Substantial Public Interest.

Controller's obligation to notify
The Controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of Personal Data or Processing restriction
carried out in accordance with Articles 33, 34 and 35 to each recipient to whom the Personal Data has been
disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. A Controller shall inform the
Data Subject about those recipients if a Data Subject requests it.

37.

Right to data portability
(1)

(2)

A Data Subject shall have the right to receive Personal Data that he has provided to a Controller in
a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format where the Processing is:
(a)

based on the Data Subject's consent or the performance of a contract; and

(b)

carried out by automated means.

The purpose of Article 37(1) is to enable ready portability between Controllers if so required by the
Data Subject, and the Data Subject shall have the right to have the Personal Data transmitted directly
from the Controller to whom the request is made to any other person, where technically feasible.

27

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(3)

38.

39.

A Controller is not required to provide or transmit any Personal Data where doing so would infringe
the rights of any other natural person.

Automated individual decision-making, including Profiling
(1)

A Data Subject shall have the right to object to any decision based solely on automated Processing,
including Profiling, which produces legal consequences concerning him or other seriously
impactful consequences and to require such decision to be reviewed manually.

(2)

Article 38(1) shall not apply if the decision is:
(a)

necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between a Data Subject and a
Controller;

(b)

authorised by Applicable Law to which the Controller is subject and which also lays down
suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject's rights; or

(c)

based on the Data Subject's explicit consent.

(3)

DIFC law concerning fraud, counter-terrorism, money laundering, and tax-evasion monitoring and
prevention which requires Processing of Personal Data that produces legal consequences
concerning a Data Subject is regarded as falling within Article 38(2)(b).

(4)

Article 38(2) does not apply if the Data Subject in question is a minor (by reference to the legal age
of majority in the United Arab Emirates from time to time).

(5)

A Controller may only rely on Articles 38(2)(a) and 38(2)(c) if it has implemented suitable
measures to safeguard a Data Subject's rights which includes, at least, the ability for the Processing
to be reviewed manually.

(6)

Decisions affecting a Data Subject may not be based solely on the automated Processing, including
Profiling, of Special Categories of Personal Data unless:
(a)

the Data Subject has given explicit consent to the Processing of those Personal Data for
such specific purposes; or

(b)

the Processing is necessary for reasons of Substantial Public Interest, on the basis of
Applicable Law, is proportionate to the aim pursued, respects the principles of data
protection and provides for suitable measures to safeguard the rights and interests of the
Data Subject.

Non-discrimination
(1)

(2)

A Controller may not discriminate against a Data Subject who exercises any rights under this Part
6, including by:
(a)

denying any goods or services to the Data Subject;

(b)

charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of
discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;

(c)

providing a less favourable level or quality of goods or services to the Data Subject; or

(d)

suggesting that the Data Subject will receive a less favourable price or rate for goods or
services or a less favourable level or quality of goods or services.

Nothing in this Article 39 prohibits a Controller from charging a Data Subject a different price or
rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is
objectively and reasonably directly related to the value provided by the Data Subject’s data.
28

DATA PROTECTION LAW
(3)

(4)

40.

Notwithstanding Article 39(1), a Controller may offer financial or non-financial incentives for the
Processing of Personal Data provided that:
(a)

the terms of the incentive are clearly communicated;

(b)

the process for receiving the benefit of the incentive is clearly communicated, is
transparent and does not require material additional effort or expense on the part of the
Data Subject;

(c)

the nature of the Processing involved is clearly communicated;

(d)

the Processing complies in all respects with this Law; and

(e)

it complies with Article 39(4).

A Data Subject shall have the right to withdraw without penalty from, and require the cessation of
Processing carried out under, any incentive scheme at any time. Incentive schemes must not be
coercive or unreasonable in nature with respect to the Processing of Personal Data, including where
the incentive is based on probability or a competition where the chance of receiving the incentive
is disproportionately low compared to the value of the Personal Data and the impact on the Data
Subject’s rights.

Methods of exercising Data Subject rights
A Controller shall make available a minimum of two (2) methods (which may include but shall not be limited
to post, telephone, email or an online form), which shall not be onerous, by which a Data Subject can contact
the Controller to request to exercise his rights under this Part. If a Controller maintains a website, at least
one (1) method of contact shall be available without charge via the website, without the need to submit data
to create an account of any sort. At least one of the methods should correspond to the contact details provided
under Article 29 or 30 as applicable.

DATA PROTECTION LAW
PART 7: PERSONAL DATA BREACHES
41.

42.

Notification of Personal Data Breaches to the Commissioner
(1)

If there is a Personal Data Breach that compromises a Data Subject's confidentiality, security or
privacy, the Controller involved shall, as soon as practicable in the circumstances, notify the
Personal Data Breach to the Commissioner.

(2)

A Processor shall notify a relevant Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a
Personal Data Breach.

(3)

A Controller or Processor shall fully co-operate with any investigation of the Commissioner in
relation to a Personal Data Breach.

(4)

The notification referred to in Article 41(1) shall at least:
(a)

describe the nature of the Personal Data Breach including where possible, the categories
and approximate number of Data Subjects concerned and the categories and approximate
amount of Personal Data records concerned;

(b)

communicate the name and contact details of the DPO or other contact point where more
information can be obtained;

(c)

describe the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach; and

(d)

describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Controller to address the
Personal Data Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible
adverse effects.

(5)

Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information
may be provided in phases when available.

(6)

A Controller shall document in writing any Personal Data Breaches, comprising the facts relating
to the Personal Data Breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. The information recorded
shall be sufficient to enable the Commissioner to verify compliance with this Article and shall be
made available without delay on request.

Notification of Personal Data Breaches to a Data Subject
(1)

When a Personal Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to the security or rights of a Data
Subject, the Controller shall communicate the Personal Data Breach to an affected Data Subject as
soon as practicable in the circumstances. If there is an immediate risk of damage to the Data Subject,
the Controller shall promptly communicate with the affected Data Subject.

(2)

The communication to the Data Subject referred to in Article 42(1) shall describe in clear and plain
language the nature of the Personal Data Breach and contain at least the information provided for
in Articles 41(4)(b) to (d). Such communication shall, where possible, make recommendations for
the Data Subject to mitigate potential adverse effects.

(3)

Where a communication to the individual Data Subjects referred to in Article 42(1) will involve
disproportionate effort, a public communication or similar measure by the Controller whereby the
Data Subjects are informed in an equally effective manner shall be sufficient.

(4)

If a Controller has not already communicated the Personal Data Breach to all relevant Data
Subjects, the Commissioner may require it to do so, including where the Commissioner considers
that there is a high risk to the security or rights of the Data Subjects involved, or otherwise direct it
to make a public communication under Article 42(3).
