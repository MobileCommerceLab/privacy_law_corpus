may direct and such person may accordingly enter upon the premises of

as a result of the exercise of any of the powers aforesaid its receipts during the period of
such exercise of powers from public telecommunication services or broadcasting as the case
may be with respect to which the said powers have been exercised or from any other systems
of telecommunication owned or operated by it have been less than its receipts from the same
source during the corresponding period on the average of the three years last preceding the
exercise of such powers there shall be paid to the Carrier or broadcasting station as
compensation for any loss of profit sustained by the said Carrier or broadcasting station by
reason of the exercise by the Governor of any of the powers hereby reserved such sum as
may be settled by agreement or as in case of difference may be determined by arbitration:

purpose of preventing indirect or suspected communication with any of Her Majesty’s
enemies or of protecting the interests of Her Majesty under the apprehension of impending
war.

provided, the arbitrator shall take into account all the circumstances of the case including

use of the Carrier’s telecommunication services so taken possession of or controlled or from
the user by it of any other system of telecommunication for the transmission of traffic which
would normally have been handled by the Carrier’s telecommunication services so taken
possession of or controlled, and as regards the Carrier’s telecommunication services with
respect to which the said powers have been exercised the receipts of the Carrier on the
average of the three years last preceding the exercise of the said powers during a period
corresponding to that of the exercise of the said powers shall be deemed to be the receipts
which the Carrier would have taken during the period of the exercise of the said powers had
the powers not been exercised.
(4) A certificate signed by the Minister to the effect that an order under the terms
of subsection (1) was made in time of war or during a proclamation of emergency and in the
public interest shall be conclusive evidence of a state of war or the existence of a
proclamation of emergency and that the order was made in the public interest.
