regarding a matter deemed urgent is made
shall provide the requested information
within, a period of not more than ten
working days.

10/ Without prejudice to other matters stipulated
to be deemed urgent by public bodies,

demonstrates that failure to provide an
information urgently would pose an
immediate risk of danger to the life or
physical well being of a person is
lodged;or

b) an applicant ,whose main engagement is
dissemination of information in the mass
media ,made a request which reasonably
demonstrates that an action taken or
about to be taken by the public body
should be released to the public
immediately.
11/ Where the public relation officer deems that
request made in accordance with sub article
(10) (a) and ( b) of this Article is not an
urgent request that requires an expedited
access ,he shall communicate his decision
along with a statement indicating the
requester’s right to make an administrative
appeal within the time limit referred to in
sub-article (9) of this Article No court may
review on appeal such a decision.
12/ The fees payable for access to information in
accordance with sub-article (2) of this Article
shall not exceed the actual cost of searching,
collecting and duplicating the record containing
the information provided that no fee shall be
charged for requests of personal information or for
requests from those who cannot afford to pay.

by law, regulation, directives or order to be
