Chapter Three POSSESSORY RIGHTS
Section I. General Rules
227.
(1)

(Definition of possession)
“Possession” refers to the holding of a thing.

(2)
“Holding” means the state of controlling a thing as a matter of
fact, whether directly or indirectly.

228.
(1)

(Direct possession and indirect possession)
A thing may be possessed indirectly through another person.

(2)
In cases described in paragraph (1), a person directly holding
a thing is referred to as a direct possessor, and a person holding a
thing indirectly through another person is referred to as an indirect
possessor.

229.

(Assignment of possession)

(1)
Possession is assigned by delivery of the thing in possession.
This form of assignment of possession is referred to as “actual
delivery”.
(2)
Possession may be assigned without actual transfer, by agreement
of the parties alone. In this case, the assignee of possession acquires
the indirect possession through [the direct possession of] the assignor.
This form of assignment of possession is referred to as “assighment of
possession by agreement” [in Khmer "agreement on possession"].
(3)
If the assignee of possession currently actually holds the thing
directly, possession may be assigned by agreement of the parties alone.
In this way, the assignor of possession loses the indirect possession
that he had through the holder of the thing. This form of assignment
of possession is referred to as “summary delivery”.
(4)
A person who possesses a thing indirectly through another person
may assign possession to a third party by agreement with such third party
and notice to this effect to the person in direct possession. This form
of assignment of possession is referred to as “assignment of possession
by direction”.

230.

(Extinguishment of possession)

Possession shall be extinguished when the possessor ceases to hold the
thing; provided that this shall not apply, where the possessor has been
dispossessed of the thing, if the possessor repossesses the thing or

within one year of such dispossession 3 .
231.

(Extinguishment of possession of an indirect possessor)

(1)
The possession of an indirect possessor will be extinguished in
the following cases:

If the authority of the direct possessor to possess on behalf
of the indirect possessor and duty of direct possessor to
possess on behalf of the indirect possessor extinguish.
b)
If a state is recognized that the direct possessor has not
agree with the possession of the indirect possessor; or
c)

the possessor has been dispossessed of the thing, the possession shall
not be extinguished if the direct possessor or indirect possessor
repossesses the thing or brings an action for recovery of possession
of the thing within one year of such dispossession.

232.

(Possession with or without intention of ownership)

(1)
In some cases of possession the possessor has the intention to
become the owner of the thing possessed and in other cases the possessor
does not have such intention. Whether such intention exists or not will
be determined on the basis of the objective nature of the ground of
acquisition of the possession.
(2)
If on the basis of the objective nature of the acquisition of
possession, the possessor does not have the intention to become the
owner of the thing, the nature of possession shall not be altered into
that involving an intention to become the owner unless the possessor
declares to the person who put him into possession that he intends to
become the owner, or unless he commences possession [anew] on the basis
of a new ground of acquisition of possession with the intention of
becoming the owner.

233.

(Flawed possession)

(1)
Possession that is acquired with knowledge that one has no right
of possession to it is referred to as “possession in bad faith” and
possession acquired without knowledge that one has no right of
possession to it as “possession in good faith”. If the lack of knowledge
results from negligence, the possession is referred to as “negligent
possession”.
(2)
“Peaceful possession” refers to possession acquired and
maintained without violence; provided that it will still be peaceful
possession if a person who has initially acquired possession peacefully

This sounds like the English action in “detinue”, but the translator has not used
this term because “return" as used later in this law extends to immovable as well
as goods, unlike detinue which is limited to goods.

uses violence to protect such possession against unlawful infringement
by a third party.

concealment, so that persons having rights over the possessed thing can
know or see the fact of such possession.
(4)

possession that despite being in good faith is negligent, to possession
that is not peaceful and to possession that is not open.

234.

(Presumptions)

(1)
Possessors are presumed to be in possession with the intention
of becoming the owners of the thing.

Possessors are presumed to be in possession in good faith,
peacefully and openly.

If there is proof of possession at two different times, possession
is presumed to have been continuous throughout the intermediate time.

(1)
A successor to possession may at his option assert his own
possession only or his own possession together with that of his
predecessor in possession.
(2)
If he asserts the possession of his predecessor together with his
own, he also succeeds to any flaws in the possession of the predecessor.
Consequently if there are flaws in the possession of the predecessor,
even if the successor’s possession is unflawed, the two possessions
together will be flawed.

principal ratifies such act. If the putative principal does not respond
within the established period of time, ratification shall be deemed to
have been rejected.
(4)

Section V. Contract for the Benefit of a Third Party
379.

(Definition)

(1)
The parties to a contract can agree to confer a right or benefit
arising under the contract upon a third party. In this case, the person
who is to perform a duty under the contract for the third party is termed
the contract donor, and the other party to the contract is termed the
contract donee. The person to receive the right or benefit is termed
a third-party beneficiary.
(2)
A third-party beneficiary is entitled to make a direct demand on
the contract donor for performance.

380.

(Third-party beneficiary)

In the course of the formation of the contract, the third-party
beneficiary need not exist when the requirements identifying the
third-party beneficiary are clearly stated. However, where a
third-party beneficiary does not exist at the scheduled time for
performance of the duty by the contract donor, the promise to perform
the contract for the benefit of a third party shall lose its effect,
and the contract donor may be discharged from the responsibility upon
performance of the contract with respect to the contract donee.
381.

(Declaration of intention to receive a benefit)

(1)
A contract donee may, at any time prior to an intended third-party
beneficiary's declaration of intention to accept the benefit to the
contract donor or the contract donee, withdraw the promise to perform
the contract for the benefit of a third party via notification to the
contract donor and the third-party beneficiary.
(2)
After the third-party beneficiary declares an intention to accept
the right or benefit, the parties to the contract may not thereafter
alter or extinguish the third-party beneficiary's right.

382.

(Defense of contract donor)

A contract donor under a contract to confer a right or benefit on a third
party may assert against the third-party beneficiary any defenses
arising under the contract.
383.

(Invalidity, rescission or termination of contract)

(1)
Where grounds for invalidity or rescission of the contract exist
between the contract donee and contract donor, either party may assert
the invalidity of or seek to rescind the contract in accordance with
the provisions of Section III or Chapter Two of this Book concerning
invalidity and rescission, notwithstanding the existence of a provision
in the contract conferring a right or benefit on a third party.

(2)
A contract donor may terminate the contract on the ground of the
contract donee's breach thereof. Where the contract donor's breach is
grounds for termination, and the third-party beneficiary has already
declared an intention to accept the right or benefit, the contract donee
can terminate the contract only with the consent of the third-party
beneficiary.

Chapter Three PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT
384.

(Obligor's duty to perform obligation)

(Right to demand performance of obligation)

(1)
An obligee is entitled to demand that the obligor perform the
obligation either with or without filing a lawsuit.
(2)
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), an obligee may
not file a lawsuit demanding performance where the parties to the
contract have agreed not to seek judicial enforcement of performance.
(3)
Even where a lawsuit seeking judicial enforcement of performance
is barred under paragraph (2), if the obligor carries out such
performance voluntarily, the obligee may receive and retain the
benefits thereof.

386.

(Defense of simultaneous performance)

Each party to a bilateral contract may refuse to perform its own
obligation until the other party tenders the performance of its
obligation. However, this shall not apply where the time for performance
of the other party's obligation has not arrived.
387.

(Defense of insecurity)

A party to a bilateral contract who is required to perform an obligation
in advance of the other party may refuse to perform the obligation if
there is a significant risk that the other party will not substantially
perform its obligation in accordance with its intended purpose. However,
this shall not apply where the other party provides security or
otherwise takes a measure that extinguishes the existing risk.

(Definition and types of non-performance)

‘Non-performance’ is defined as an obligor's failure to perform an
obligation arising under a contract. The types of ‘non-performance’ are
as follows:
a)
cases in which performance cannot be carried out by the
established time for performance due to a delay in
performance;
b)
cases in which performance is impossible;
c)
cases in which full and complete performance in accordance
with the intended purpose of the obligation is not carried
out; and
d)
other cases in which performance is not carried out in
accordance with the intended purpose.
390.

(Remedies for non-performance)

Where an obligor fails to perform an obligation, the obligee may demand
specific performance, damages, or termination of the contract, in
accordance with the provisions set forth in Sections II through IV of
this Chapter IV.
391.

(Delayed performance)

An obligor shall be liable for delayed performance if he fails to perform
the obligation at the time described below:
a)
where performance is to occur at a time certain, when such
time has arrived;
b)
where performance is to occur at a time that is uncertain,
when the obligor knows that such time has arrived; or
c)
where no time for performance is specified, when the obligor
receives a demand for performance.
392.

(Impossibility of performance)

(1)
Where it is physically impossible to perform the obligation, the
performance is deemed impossible. Performance shall also be deemed
impossible where performance is determined to be impossible from a
social or economic standpoint.
(2)
Where it is established prior to the time for performance that
the performance of an obligation will be impossible at the time for
performance, the performance shall be deemed impossible when such
impossibility is established.

393.

performed but the act of performance was not complete, where only
partial performance was carried out, or where for any other reason
complete performance in accordance with the intended purpose of the
obligation was not carried out.
394.

(Other non-performance)

In addition to the types of non-performance described in Articles
391(Delayed performance) through 393(Incomplete performance), where
there is a breach of any other duty arising under the contract, the
contract shall be deemed non-performed.
395.

(Multiple remedies)

Where multiple remedies are available to the obligee, the obligee may
select any or all of such remedies so long as they are not in mutual
conflict.

Section II. Specific Performance
396.

(Court order for specific performance)

Where an obligor does not voluntarily perform an obligation, the obligee
may seek an order of specific performance from the court, except where
the nature of the obligation is not suitable for specific performance.
The provisions set forth in the Civil Enforcement Law shall apply to
the proceedings of specific performance.
397.

(Relationship to demand for performance and other remedies)

Where the obligor fails to perform an obligation, the obligee may demand
damages either instead of performance or together with performance so
long as there is no conflict between these two demands.

Section III. Damages
398.

(Requirements for damages)

(1)
Where an obligation is not performed, the obligee may demand
damages from the obligor for any resulting harm. However, if the obligor

obligor is not liable for damages.
(2)
Where an obligor uses another person as an assistant to assist
in carrying out performance of the obligation, the obligor may not avoid
liability unless the obligor proves that the obligor was not negligent
in the selection of and supervision over the assistant and that the
assistant was not at fault.

(1)
Where the subject matter of the obligation is the payment of money,
the obligor is not exempted from payment of interest for delay even where
the obligor proves that the delay in payment was the result of force
majeure. The interest for delay shall be calculated based on the legal
rate of interest. Where an agreed-upon interest rate exceeds the legal
interest rate, the agreed-upon interest rate shall be applied.
(2)
The obligor shall be exempted from liability for damages beyond
interest for delay if the obligor proves that the obligor was not at
fault for the non-performance.

400.

(Concept of damages)

(1)
The obligee may demand as damages (a) compensation for the benefit
of performance that would have been received under the contract, as well
as (b) expenditures that were wasted due to the non-performance to the
extent that such expenditures do not duplicate amounts received as
benefit of performance damages, and (c) additional expenditures or
burdens resulting from non-performance.
(2)
The court may, based on a demand from the obligee, order payment
of damages for mental harm. The amount of damages payable for mental
harm shall be determined by the court after consideration of the
surrounding circumstances.

401.

(Scope of damages)

The obligor shall provide compensation for the following types of
damages:
a)
Normally occurring damages suffered by the obligee due to
non-performance;
b)
Regarding special damages suffered by the obligee due to
special circumstances, [such damages shall be compensated]
where the occurrence of such special damages could have been
anticipated by the parties when the contract was executed.
However, this shall not apply where the parties did not take
the
possible
occurrence
of
special
damages
into
consideration when the contract was executed; and
c)
Notwithstanding subparagraphs (a) and (b), where the
non-performance is the result of [the obligor’s] malicious
intent or bad faith conduct, the court may, based on the
obligee's demand for damages, order that the obligor pay to
the obligee as damages the profit or benefit obtained by the
obligor from the conduct comprising the non-performance.
402.

(Grounds for reduction of damages)

(1)
Where the obligee's negligence or fault contributed to the
occurrence of non-performance or damages, the court may reduce the
amount of damages to be paid by the obligor to the extent that the
obligee's conduct contributed thereto.
(2)

Where damages have been expanded due to the obligee’s negligent

failure to mitigate damages, the court may reduce the amount to be paid
by the obligor in proportion to the amount of the damages that could
have been mitigated by the obligee.
403.

(Liquidated damages, etc.)

(1)
The obligor and obligee may separately and in advance establish
conditions for the payment of damages and an amount to be paid.
(2)
A special agreement exempting the obligor from liability for
non-performance that is intentional or the result of gross negligence
is void.
(3)
Where the parties agree on the amount of damages, the court may
not increase or reduce the agreed-upon amount. However, where the
amount fixed by the parties as liquidated damages is either grossly
higher or grossly lower than the amount of damages calculated in
accordance with the provisions of Article 401(Scope of damages), the
court may increase or decrease the liquidated damages amount fixed by
the parties.
(4)
The liquidation of damages does not obstruct a claim for
performance or for termination of the contract. An amount fixed and
agreed to by the parties as damages for delay shall not be binding on
the parties where the obligee seeks termination of the contract and
compensation for damages as a substitute for [the delivery of] the
property comprising the subject matter of the contract.
(5)
A penalty for breach of contract shall be presumed to constitute
liquidated damages.

404.

(Compensation in money)

Compensation for damages for non-performance shall be made by the
obligor in money. However, this shall not apply where the parties
separately agree otherwise.
405.

(Subrogation by compensation)

Where an obligee has received as damages compensation for the value of
the property or right comprising the subject matter of the obligation,
the obligor shall be automatically subrogated to the position of the
obligee in regard to that property or right.
406.

(Extinctive prescription)

The period of extinctive prescription applicable to the right to demand
compensation for damages based on non-performance is five years from
the time when the damages occurred.

Where a thing has been destroyed or rendered incapable of being
returned due to the negligence of or any other reason attributable to
the other party, the person possessing a right of termination is not
obligated to return the price of the thing pursuant to the provisions
of Paragraph (2).

property may recover the property from the person receiving the invalid
performance.

current residence of the obligee.
446.

(Costs of performance)

In the absence of an agreement regarding the costs of performance, such

Sub-section II. Assignment of Performance
449.

(Assignment via designation)

(1)
Where an obligor owes to the same obligee multiple obligations
of the same type, if a tender of performance is not sufficient to
discharge all of the obligations, the performing party may at the time
of performance designate the obligation to which the performance shall
be assigned.
(2)
If the performing party does not make the designation described
in paragraph (1), the party accepting the performance may make the
assignment when performance is accepted. However, the [provisions of]
statutory assignment shall apply if the performing party makes an
immediate objection to such assignment.
(3)
The assignment described in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made
via notice to the other party.

450.

(Statutory assignment)

If neither the performing party nor the party receiving performance make
an assignment of performance, the performance shall be assigned
according to the following rules:
a)
Between the obligations that are due and those that are not
due, the former shall have priority.
b)
Where all of the obligations are either due or not due, the
obligation as to which discharge would confer the greatest
benefit on the obligor shall have priority.
c)
If the obligor would benefit equally from the discharge of
all obligations, the obligation which first became due or
will become due shall have priority.
d)
Among multiple obligations that are equal in regard to the
benefit of discharge for the obligor and that become due at
the same time, the performance shall be assigned in
proportion to the amount of each obligation.
451.

(Order of assignment among costs, interests and principal)

If an obligor as to one or more obligations is obligated to pay interest
and costs in addition to principal, a performance that is insufficient
to discharge all of these shall be assigned in the order of costs,
interest and principal. However, if the obligor and the obligee have
agreed otherwise, such agreement shall prevail.
452.

(Performance for two or more obligees)

The provisions of Articles 449(Assignment via designation),
450(Statutory assignment) and 451(Order of assignment among costs,
interests and principal) shall apply mutatis mutandis where the obligor

Sub-section II. Tender and Deposit
453.

(Meaning and basic effect of tender of performance)

(1)
Tender of performance shall mean that the obligor has completed
preparations for an act of performance and has asked the obligee to
accept such performance.
(2)
Even where the obligor has made a tender of performance, if an
obligee does not take the actions necessary to accept the performance,
the obligor is relieved of liability for non-performance.
(3)
Where the obligor who owes a monetary obligation with interest
accruing thereon makes a tender of performance, if the obligee does not
accept the performance, the obligor shall subsequently not be required
to pay interest thereon.

454.

(Method of tender)

A tender of performance must constitute an actual tender of performance
in accordance with the intended purpose of the obligation. However,
where the obligee has refused in advance to accept the tender of
performance, or an act on the part of the obligee is necessary for
performance of the obligation, it is sufficient for the obligor to give
notice to the obligee that preparations for performance have been
completed and demand the obligee's acceptance of performance.
455.

(Effect of tender)

Where an obligee does not accept a tender of performance, the following
effects shall occur, in addition to the effect described in Article
453(Meaning and basic effect of tender of performance):
a)
where the obligor bears the risk in a bilateral contract,
the risk shall be transferred to the obligee;
b)
the obligee shall lose the defense of simultaneous
performance in a bilateral contract; and
c)
the obligor may be exempted from the obligation by carrying
out deposit.
456.

(Delayed receipt)

(1)
Where the obligee has in advance refused to accept performance,
or where tender of performance has been made to the obligee, if
performance is not accepted due to the obligee’s fault, the obligor may
demand damages from the obligee for any injury caused by such
non-acceptance.
(2)
Where the obligee's non-acceptance of a tender of performance
constitutes a material breach of the obligee's contractual duties, the
obligor may terminate the contract.

comprising the subject matter of the obligation with an authorized
depository office in the following situations:

but the obligee refuses to accept or cannot accept the
performance; or
b)
where the identity of the obligee cannot be determined
without any fault of the obligor.
(2)
The performing party may recover the property deposited until the
obligee has accepted the deposit or a judgment declaring the deposit
valid has become final and binding. In such a case, the deposit shall
be deemed not to have occurred. However, this shall not apply where a
pledge or hypothec has been extinguished as a result of the deposit.
(3)
The details and procedures governing deposit shall be prescribed
in the [Official Deposit Act].

458.

(Obligor's right to sell)

suitable for official deposit, or is in danger of perishing or being
damaged, the obligor may, with the permission of the court, sell the

depository office. The same applies where the cost of preserving the
property is prohibitive.
Sub-section III. Subrogation by performance
459.

(Subrogation by performance)

A person who has procured a discharge through his own performance
or other expenditure and thereby obtains the right to demand
indemnification from the obligor may exercise via subrogation the claim
held by the obligee and all other rights associated therewith.
(2)
The provisions of Article 503(Requirement for Assertion of
Assignment of Nominative Claim against Third Parties) shall apply
mutatis mutandis to the situation described in paragraph (1).

for
indemnification) may be substituted for the notification described in

from a security interest. However, this shall not apply to rights that
directly accompany the contractual position of the obligee under the
contract.

461.

The following conditions shall apply to a subrogee:
a)
Unless the existence of a subrogation is entered in the
registration of a statutory lien, pledge of immovable or
hypothec that is created over any of the obligor's property,
a guarantor or third party security provider cannot assert
his subrogation to the position of an obligee against a
third-party acquirer who acquires an immovable comprising
the object of such statutory lien, pledge or hypothec.
b)
A third-party acquirer who acquires a thing comprising the
object of any security interest from an obligor shall not
be subrogated to the position of an obligee with respect to
a guarantor.
c)
A third-party acquirer who acquires a thing comprising the
object of any security interest from an obligor shall be
subrogated to the position of an obligee with respect to
other third-party acquirers who acquire the objects of other
security interests from such obligor in proportion to their
respective values of the acquired things.
d)
The provisions of sub-paragraph (c) shall apply mutatis
mutandis to the relationship between third party security
providers as described in Article 758.a.766(Definition of

subrogation to the position of the obligee shall be made in
accordance with the number of persons of each group. However,
where there are multiple third-party security providers,
subrogation to the position of the obligee shall be made in
accordance with the respective prices of the things
[provided for security by each third-party security
provider] with regard to the portion of the obligation
remaining after subtracting the portion for which [a group
of] guarantors is responsible.
(Partial subrogation)

(1)
Where subrogated performance of a part of an obligation has been
made, a subrogee shall exercise the rights of the obligee together with
the obligee to the extent of the partial performance. However, where
the subrogee seeks to execute these rights, the obligee's consent must
be obtained. Furthermore, at the request of the obligee, such rights
or ranking shall be transferred to the obligee at no cost to the extent
of the remaining obligation.
(2)
In the case described in paragraph (1), only the obligee may
terminate the contract on the ground of non-performance. However, the
subrogee shall be compensated to the extent of the subrogee's

Where a person exists who could be subrogated to the position of an
obligee pursuant to the provisions of Article 459(Subrogation by
performance), and the security has been lost or diminished due to the
intentional or negligent act of the obligee, a person qualified to
invoke such subrogation may be exempted from his own responsibility or

A set-off shall be effected by a party's declaration to set-off
to the other party.

BOOK SIX “SECURITY” 10
Chapter One GENERAL PROVISIONS
766.

(Definition of security provider and third party acquirer)

(1)
A person who creates a real security right over his own property
so as to secure the debt of another shall be called a 'security
provider'.
(2)
A person who receives the assignment of the object of a real
security right created by the debtor to secure his own debt shall be
called a 'third party acquirer.'
10

In the translation of this Book, the terms ‘debt,’ ‘debtor,’ and ‘creditor’ are
used in lieu of ‘obligation,’ ‘obligor’ and ‘obligee’ (the terms used in the Khmer
original). Because it is assumed that cases to which this Book will apply will
typically involve monetary obligations, it is thought that the use of such terms
will aid in understanding the underlying concepts. However, regardless of
terminology, the provisions of this Book should be understood to apply to both
monetary and non-monetary obligations.

obligation, as a defense to a claim for indemnification by the joint
obligor who obtained a discharge from the obligation through
performance or other expenditure. However, where the other obligor's

obligor may deem his own performance or other action discharging the
obligation as effective.

obligee, if the obligors are not acknowledged to have in common an
intention to assume joint and several responsibility with the others,
the provisions of Article 921(Definition of joint obligation) shall
apply mutatis mutandis. However, where performance of the obligation
is divisible, and divided performances will not harm the obligee, each
obligor shall assume a divided and separate obligation corresponding
to his respective share. Where each obligor's share cannot be determined,
each share shall be presumed to be equal.
(2)
In the case described in the first sentence of paragraph (1),
events occurring with respect to one obligor shall not affect the other
obligors except in the cases described in Article 925(Universal effect
of performance, etc.) and paragraph (1) of Article 926(Universal effect
of offset).

Where one obligor described in the first sentence of paragraph
(1) obtains a discharge of the obligation through his own performance
or other expenditure and the other obligors are thereby discharged as
well, if it is necessary to preserve fairness between the performing
obligor and the other obligors, the performing obligor may, to the
extent necessary to preserve fairness among the obligors, demand
