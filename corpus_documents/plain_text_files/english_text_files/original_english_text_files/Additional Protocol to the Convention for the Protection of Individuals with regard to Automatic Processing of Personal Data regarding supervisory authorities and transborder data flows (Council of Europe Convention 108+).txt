regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data regarding supervisory
authorities and transborder data flows
Strasbourg, 8.XI.2001

Preamble
The Parties to this additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with
regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, opened for signature in Strasbourg on
28 January 1981 (hereafter referred to as "the Convention");
Convinced that supervisory authorities, exercising their functions in complete independence,
are an element of the effective protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data;
Considering the importance of the flow of information between peoples;
Considering that, with the increase in exchanges of personal data across national borders, it
is necessary to ensure the effective protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
and in particular the right to privacy, in relation to such exchanges of personal data,
Have agreed as follows:
Article 1 – Supervisory authorities
1

Each Party shall provide for one or more authorities to be responsible for ensuring compliance
with the measures in its domestic law giving effect to the principles stated in Chapters II
and III of the Convention and in this Protocol.

2

a

To this end, the said authorities shall have, in particular, powers of investigation and
intervention, as well as the power to engage in legal proceedings or bring to the attention
of the competent judicial authorities violations of provisions of domestic law giving effect
to the principles mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 1 of this Protocol.

b

Each supervisory authority shall hear claims lodged by any person concerning the
protection of his/her rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the processing of
personal data within its competence.

3

The supervisory authorities shall exercise their functions in complete independence.

4

Decisions of the supervisory authorities, which give rise to complaints, may be appealed

In accordance with the provisions of Chapter IV, and without prejudice to the provisions of
Article 13 of the Convention, the supervisory authorities shall co-operate with one another to

Article 2 –

Transborder flows of personal data to a recipient which is not subject to
the jurisdiction of a Party to the Convention

Each Party shall provide for the transfer of personal data to a recipient that is subject to the
jurisdiction of a State or organisation that is not Party to the Convention only if that State or
organisation ensures an adequate level of protection for the intended data transfer.

the transfer of personal data :

if domestic law provides for it because of :

authorities according to domestic law.
