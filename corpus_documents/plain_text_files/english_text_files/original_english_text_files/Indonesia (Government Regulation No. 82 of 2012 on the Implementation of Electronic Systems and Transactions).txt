using the Electronic Signature.

Business Actor conducting an Electronic Transaction may be granted a certification by
the Reliability Certification Institution. This Institution will issue a Certificate of Reliability
of Reliability through the process of Reliability Certification, including examination of
complete and correct information regarding the Business Actor.
Reliability Certification Institution should be established, at least, by consultants,
