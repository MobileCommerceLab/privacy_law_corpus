Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

Malta Bankers’ Association

Introduction
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR)) will become directly applicable in all Member States,
including Malta, as from 25 May 2018. It will replace the EU’s Data Protection Directive
95/46/EC which is currently transposed under the Data Protection Act (Chapter 440 of the
Laws of Malta), and provides for a harmonisation of the legal data protection regime
throughout the EU.
The GDPR retains the core rules stipulated by previous data protection legislation and
continues to regulate the processing of personal data with its goal being that of protecting
individuals in this regard.
Banks are amongst the businesses that are directly affected by the GDPR, since they process
significant amounts of personal data.
These Guidelines have been developed after a consultation process with the Information
and Data Protection Commissioner who ascertained that the provisions of these Guidelines
comply with the Regulation. This notwithstanding, such guidelines and the interpretations
contained therein are without prejudice to any decision which the Commissioner may take
in relation to complaints and, or any other specific data protection issues.
The purpose of these Guidelines is not to provide a detailed and comprehensive coverage of
the whole Regulation. Rather, these Guidelines are intended to focus only on those sections
of the Regulation which may not be entirely clear, or which could lend themselves to
differing interpretations, in order that a common understanding is arrived at and a
consistent interpretation is applied across the banking sector.
The Guidelines will be further developed over time, as practical issues and problems arise,
and the banks’ coordinated response to such issues is agreed and documented in the
Guidelines. These Guidelines are also without prejudice to any further Guidelines which
might be issued by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party.

SECTION 1: Article 3 – Territorial scope
The Regulation primarily applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the
activities of an establishment of a data controller or processor established in the Union,
regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Although the term
“establishment” implies the effective and real exercise of the processing activity through a
stable arrangement, the legal form of such arrangement is not a determining factor and
could be through a branch or a subsidiary with legal personality (Recital 22).
The Regulation also applies to businesses based outside the Union that offer goods and
services to, or monitor, individuals in the Union. Therefore, controllers and processors will
be subject to the GDPR where the processing activities relate to:


the offering of goods or services to individuals in the Union. It captures both free and
paid for goods and services; and



monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the Union.

In either case, the Regulation will apply when processing personal data in the Union, thus
the nationality or habitual residence of those individuals is irrelevant.
These businesses will need to appoint a representative in the Union (Article 27), subject to
certain limited exemptions. Such a representative must be established in a Member State
where the relevant individuals are based. There is a limited exemption to the obligation to
appoint a representative: where the processing is occasional, unlikely to be a risk to
individuals and does not involve large scale processing of special categories of personal
data. The representative should be explicitly designated by means of a written mandate of
the controller or processor to act on its behalf and should be subject to enforcement
proceedings in the event of non-compliance by the controller or processor.
Processors established outside the Union may also be subject to the provisions of the GDPR
despite the fact that in these circumstances such processor would only be acting upon the
instructions of a controller. For instance, the Regulation shall still apply if the processor
established outside the Union:




is dealing with a controller or processor based in the Union. This is because the
processor would be processing personal data “in the context of the activities of” a
controller or processor in the Union. (Article 3 (1)). In other words, when processing
the personal data of data subjects who are in the Union, the provisions of the GDPR
shall apply; or
supplies services to a controller or processor who in turn supplies services to
provide goods or services to, or monitor, individuals in the Union. In particular, the
processor’s activities arguably “relate to” that offering of goods or services, or
monitoring (Article 3 (2)). Therefore, in some cases, processors based outside the
Unionmight be subject to the provisions of the GDPR if it only deals with entities
based outside the Union.

SECTION 2: Article 5 – Principles relating to processing of personal data
The guiding principles are listed under Article 5 (‘Principles relating to processing of personal
data’). These are worth recalling at the outset as any reading or interpretation of other
sections must be consistent with these principles.
Article 5 of the GDPR requires a controller (the person who determines the purposes and
means of processing of personal data) to ensure that:
a) personal data are processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner;
b) personal data are only collected for specific, explicitly stated and legitimate purposes
and are not processed for any purpose that is incompatible with that for which the
information is collected;
c) personal data that are processed are adequate, relevant and limited to what is
necessary in relation to the purposes of the processing;
d) personal data that are processed are accurate and, where necessary, up to date and
all reasonable measures are taken to complete, correct, block or erase data to the
extent that such data are incomplete or incorrect, having regard to the purposes for
which they are processed;
e) personal data are kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no
longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed;
Personal data are kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no
longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed
Data on customers should not be retained for a longer period than is necessary.
In this regard, banks should be guided by the retention periods which were agreed by the
Malta Bankers’ Association with the Office of the Information and Data Protection
Commissioner (see Annex I to these Guidelines). Furthermore, with reference to retention
periods, it should be emphasised that in view of the amplified requirements to inform
clients about the data processing pursuant to Articles 13 and 14, banks are required to
inform clients about the intended storage periods, or at least the criteria used to determine
such retention periods (e.g. by referring to the specific legal obligations laying down a
mandatory retention period).
f) personal data are processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the
personal data, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

SECTION 3: Article 6 – Lawfulness of processing
Apart from the principles detailed in Article 5 of the GDPR, processing must also satisfy at
least one of the legal criteria under Article 6. Where special categories of personal data are
processed, at least one of the legal criteria under Article 9 must be satisfied (see Section 5).
Article 6 (1) makes it clear that the processing of personal data will only be lawful if it
satisfies at least one of the following six processing conditions:
a.

If the data subject has unambiguously given his consent.

This implies that the individual has given his consent to the processing for one or more
specific purposes. By definition, consent must be freely given, specific and informed. The
controller must keep records in order to be able to demonstrate that consent has been
given by the data subject. Reference must also be made to Article 7 of the GDPR (see
Section 4) which makes provision for the conditions for consent.
Where consent has been given under the Data Protection Directive (as transposed into
national law by the Data Protection Act), it will continue to be valid under the Regulation to
the extent that it meets the new and stringent requirements for consent provided for by the
GDPR.
Controllers must ensure that their procedures to obtain consent are valid in terms of the
prescriptive requirements set out in the GDPR. Procedures must also be in place to record
and act upon a withdrawal of consent.
If the individual has not given his consent to the processing (as qualified above), the
processing is only allowed if it falls under one of the following five headings.
b. If processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject
is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering
into a contract.
Therefore, processing in order to provide a product or service requested by a customer is
perfectly permissible, and no further consent is needed.
Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is
party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a
contract.
In those instances where banks process personal data which are necessary for the provision
of a service requested by a client or prospective client, in line with agreed terms and
conditions aimed at regulating the relationship between the client and the bank, such
processing is considered legitimate under Article 6(1) (b).
Examples
(1) Various types of insurance policies (life, fire, theft, etc…) are regularly pledged to the
banks as security for credit facilities extended to the pledgor himself, or to a third party
for whom the pledgor is standing as surety.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

5

Malta Bankers’ Association

In order to complete and validate their security, the banks give notice of such pledges to the
insurance companies concerned, also requesting the current surrender value / expected
maturity value of life policies, confirmation that the premium has been paid to date,
notification by the insurance company to the bank in the event of future premium
remaining unpaid, and confirmation that there are no existing prior-ranking charges on the
policies.
Processing of the above data at the time that a policy is pledged, and periodically thereafter,
is essential for the banks to be able to look at the pledged policies as effective security, and
such processing should not require the pledgor’s specific consent as the pledgor himself is a
party to the pledge agreement. Moreover, such processing ‘is necessary for a purpose that
concerns a legitimate interest of the controller’ (see Article 6 (1) (f)).
The position of the insurance companies, when responding to such requests by the banks, is
likewise covered by Article 6 (1) (f) (see below).
(2) In the course of their business, banks discount or accept as security Bills of Exchange
which are payable to, or have been endorsed in favour of, their customers.
Bills of Exchange are negotiable instruments, and by their very nature contain details of
various third parties, including the drawer, drawee, beneficiary and subsequent endorsees,
all of whom are parties to the Bill of Exchange. As such, no notification to any of these
parties is deemed necessary when banks are processing Bills of Exchange handed to them by
their customers for discounting or as security for credit facilities.
c. If processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the
controller is subject.
This applies in situations involving data processing which is carried out to comply with
statutory obligations imposed by law on controllers, e.g. reporting to the tax authorities, or
reporting of suspicious transactions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Regulations.
Only legal obligations under Union or national law will satisfy this condition.
Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is
subject.
(1) This covers processing due to statutory duties imposed by law such as reporting or due
diligence obligations arising from the Prevention of Money Laundering Regulations,
reporting to tax authorities in terms of FATCA or other agreements or laws.
(2) Banks must necessarily process and maintain data relating to attachment / freezing
orders issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering legislation, persons who have
been interdicted, garnishee orders and any other order issued by a Court of law or any
other competent authority.
(3) Banks are required, under the Prevention of Money Laundering legislation, to process
and retain copies of customers’ identification documents.
Where the information is directly requested from the clients, banks shall inform clients that
such data are being requested due to its statutory requirements.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

Malta Bankers’ Association

In other instances, where banks process personal information as part of their statutory or
legal obligations, and such data are not directly obtained from the client, banks are exempt
from notifying the client where the individual already has the information, or where
processing or disclosure is expressly laid down by law to which the bank is subject and which
provides appropriate measures to protect data subject’s rights.
d. If processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or
of another natural person.
The Regulation does not define ‘vital interests’. This is typically limited to processing
needed for medical emergencies.
e. If processing is necessary for the performance of a task that is carried out in the
public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller

This article may also be utilised when processing of personal data is necessary for the
performance of an activity that is carried out in the public interest. The notion of public
interest is developed mainly through case law.
f. If processing is necessary for a purpose that concerns a legitimate interest of the
controller or of a third party, except where such interest is overridden by the interest
to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular
where the data subject is a child.
This principle sets up a balance between two interests. Thus, if the consequences of the
processing are detrimental to a particular individual, and there are no other ‘necessary’
grounds that would take precedence, then one would expect the individual’s interests to
override the controller’s interests in the continuation of the processing.
Processing is necessary for a purpose that concerns a legitimate interest of the controller
or of a third party, except where such interest is overridden by the interest to protect the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular where the data subject
is a child.
(1) Lending is one of the banks’ major business activities and ‘Loans and Advances to
Customers’ normally account for a large proportion (+50%) of their total assets. Such
business carries significant potential credit risks which banks must manage with great
caution and prudence in the interests of their shareholders, customers, staff and the
financial services industry in general.
For this reason, banks consider it vital and certainly in their legitimate interest to maintain
relevant information to alert their lending officers to the risks of making new or further
advances to certain individuals who, on the basis of past experience, clearly do not qualify
for such new or additional lending.
Typically, the nature of the information maintained would include details of:



Defaulting borrowing customers, where recovery of the debt is doubtful or very
problematic.
Customers whose current account or payment card account has been misconducted.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

Malta Bankers’ Association










Individuals (both customers and non-customers) whose application for credit facilities
has been declined by any branch of the bank.
Individuals who have been declared bankrupt, or in respect of whom bankruptcy
proceedings are in course.
Drawers of cheques returned unpaid to the bank by other banks (on which the cheques
are drawn) with answer ‘Refer to Drawer’.
Drawees (both customers and non-customers) of Bills of Exchange which were
discounted /accepted as security by the bank, and which were not honoured when
payment fell due.
Individuals (both customers and non-customers) who are known / suspected of having
forged or stolen cheques, or to be in possession of forged or stolen cheques. Such
information would need to be supported by a police report or other reliable sources
(e.g. the bank’s security officer who would have conducted the necessary
investigations).
Information received from Credit Reference Agencies, the Central Credit Register
maintained by the Central Bank of Malta and from other reference databases.

For obvious reasons, banks may need to retain such information even after termination of
their banking relationship with the customers concerned. However, the banks shall review
all such information periodically to ensure that it is correct/ up-to-date, and judiciously
consider deletion of such information in those cases where retention of the data is no
longer deemed necessary.
(2) The processing of personal data by the banks for the purposes of pledged insurance
policies and any notice of pledge which is issued to insurance companies is covered not
only by Article 6 (1) (b) but also by Article 6 (1) (f).
This interpretation is supported by the wording of Article 6 (1) (f) which permits the
processing of personal data when such processing “...is necessary for the purposes of the
legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party. . .” (i.e. the banks in the
case of pledged policies).
It is certainly in the banks’ legitimate interest to be informed that a pledgor has not paid his
premium, since this would enable the bank to pay the premium itself (as it is legally entitled
to do) and thus preventing the lapse of the policy which could be extremely detrimental to
the bank. Likewise, a bank has a legitimate interest to ascertain the value of the security
against which it is allowing credit facilities to a debtor.

(3) The ‘Know Your Customer’ principle is particularly relevant to bank business, and banks
must seek to have maximum knowledge of a prospective customer’s affairs, including
details of his background, means, etc. This is also necessary for banks to comply with the
due diligence procedures which are called for under the anti-money laundering
legislation (see Article 6 (1) (c) above).
While the processing which is necessary as part of the ‘Know Your Customer’ and due
diligence process may be carried out in view of the legal obligations to which banks are
subject and also for purposes concerning legitimate business interests, a distinction needs
to be drawn between instances where processing is necessary in view of such obligations or
for purposes involving core business activities of banks, and other situations where the
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

8

Malta Bankers’ Association

processing is intended to provide value-added services aimed at specific clients based on
their unique customer profile. When collecting and processing personal data as part of their
due diligence, Banks should take into account the principles contained in Article 5 of the
GDPR, more specifically the purpose limitation principle.
In this regard, where customers are subject to profiling aimed at targeting them with
specific customised offers, products or services, similar profiling would require the consent
of such persons.
Other market segmentation or profitability analyses, carried out for the purposes of
enabling the bank to render an overall better service to its customers, may be considered in
the legitimate interest of banks.

The Necessity Factor
The use of the word ‘necessary’ in Article 6 (b)–(f) should not be overlooked. This word
implies that under these provisions, processing is permitted only if the purpose is attained
by means of such processing.
Why processing conditions really matter
Under the GDPR, it is important to clearly understand and identify the legal ground for the
processing of personal data. In view of the prescriptive nature of consent under the GDPR,
relying on consent as a legal basis will only be possible in limited circumstances where all
the conditions required for a valid consent (as outlined in Section 7), are fulfilled.

Other processing operations where banks cannot rely on consent as legal ground for
processing.
CCTV
Video surveillance constitutes processing of personal data. Persons within the monitored
area must be aware that they are being monitored. For this purpose banks should affix
appropriate signs, which are clearly visible, on the façade of their premises. The signs should
clearly state the purpose of processing.
Normally, CCTV recordings within a bank are used for security purposes. It is not excluded,
however, that available CCTV recordings could be used by a bank for the purpose of an
internal investigation involving a member(s) of its staff provided, however, that the staff
concerned had been made aware that they could have been recorded on the bank’s
monitoring system.
CCTV recordings shall not be retained for a period longer than is necessary. In so far as
customer-facing footage is concerned, such period shall not be longer than 30 days,
provided that where specific footage is used in connection with an investigation, a copy of
the relevant extract from the recordings may be retained as evidence until the case is
concluded. Back-office operations footage does not as a rule capture the faces of the
employees, but only their hands and the cash handling process. In such cases, the footage of
back-office operations can be kept for a period which is not longer than 90 days.
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

9

Malta Bankers’ Association

CCTV’s in the form of pin-hole cameras are used by banks on ATM’s. In this case, since such
monitoring is carried out mainly for the prevention of crimes, no signs indicating the
presence of the pin-hole camera need be affixed to the ATM.
Telephone Recordings
Recordings of telephone conversations constitute processing of personal data. Callers and
staff should therefore be advised beforehand if such recording is being carried out. This
requirement is also applicable to the recording of outbound calls. In similar cases, staff
members shall, prior to proceeding with the telephone call, inform the recipient that the call
will be recorded.
The retention period for telephone recordings varies depending on the purpose for
processing such recordings. As a general rule, telephone recordings ought not be kept for a
period longer than thirty (30) days. However, those telephone recordings which have a
bearing on the legal or contractual obligations of the bank can be kept for the term of the
contract or for as long as the legal obligation subsists.
In the case of all telephone recordings retained for training purposes, the identity of the
person and as much as possible the voice of the person ought to be masked.
Monitoring of Electronic Mail and Internet Usage
In accordance with the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party’s Opinion 2/2017 on data
processing at work (adopted on 8 June 2017), when processing data relating to the use of
technologies by employees, banks as employers should always consider whether:





The processing activity is necessary, and if so, the legal grounds that apply;
The proposed processing of personal data is fair to the employees;
The processing activity is proportionate to the concerns raised; and
The processing activity is transparent.

Where it is the bank’s policy to monitor staff e-mails and Internet usage, this policy should
be clearly stated and communicated to all staff. It is recommended that in these instances
banks adopt a read and sign approach.
Further detailed guidance on the monitoring by employers of their employees’ use of
technology at the workplace or outside the workplace can be accessed by reference to the
Article 29 Data Protection Working Party’s Opinion 2/2017 on data processing at work – see
Annex II to these Guidelines.

SECTION 4: Article 7 – Conditions for consent
Article 7 of the GDPR stipulates the following conditions for consent:
(i)

Plain language
A request for consent must be in an intelligible and easily accessible form in clear
and plain language.

(ii)

Separate
Where the request for consent is part of a written form, it must be clearly
distinguishable from other matters.

(iii)

Affirmative action
The consent must consist of a clear affirmative action. Inactivity or silence is not
enough and the use of “pre-ticked boxes” is not permitted.

(iv)

Consent to all purposes

(v)

If the relevant processing has multiple purposes, consent must be given for all of
them. For example, in the context of the provision of a service, it is not possible to
rely on the consent obtained in this regard if direct marketing is envisaged. A
separate consent must be obtained for the latter.
No detriment
Consent will not be valid if the individual does not have a genuine free choice or if it
is detrimental to him/her should he/she refuse or withdraw consent.

(vi)

No power imbalance
Consent might not be valid if there is a clear imbalance of power between the
individual and the controller.

(vii)

Unbundled consent
“Bundle Consent” is not permitted. Where different processing activities are taking
place, consent is not valid unless the individual can consent to them separately.

(viii)

Not tied to contract
Consent is not valid if it is a condition for the performance of a contract.

(ix)

Withdrawable
The individual can withdraw consent at any time and prior to giving consent, the
data subject shall be informed thereof. For a data subject to withdraw his or her
consent, it should be as easy as it was at the stage when the consent was given.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

11

Malta Bankers’ Association

(x)

Explicit
When special categories of personal data or when transferring personal dataoutside
the Union, the consent must be explicit. This entails a degree of formality, for
example, the individual being requested to tick a box containing the express word
“consent”.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

12

Malta Bankers’ Association

SECTION 5: Article 9 – Processing of special categories of personal data
Article 9 of the GDPR deals with the processing of ‘special categories of personal data’ and
places much stronger controls when processing such data.
‘Special categories of personal data’ are in terms of the GDPR (Article 9 (1)) ”personal data
revealing race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religions or philosophical beliefs, or trade
union membership” as well as “genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely
identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s
sex life or sexual orientation”
Any processing of special categories of personal data must satisfy at least one of the
following conditions:
a. Explicit consent
The individual has given explicit consent.
b. Legal obligation related to employment
The processing is necessary for a legal obligation in the field of employment and social
security law or for a collective agreement.
c. Vital interests
The processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the individual or of
another natural person. This is typically limited to processing needed for medical
emergencies.
d. Not for profit bodies
The processing is carried out in the course of the legitimate activities of a not-for-profit
body and only relates to members or related persons and the personal data is not
disclosed outside that body without consent.
e. Public information
The processing relates to personal data which is manifestly made public by the data
subject.
f. Legal claims
The processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or
whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity.
g. Substantial public interest
The processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of
Union or Member State law.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

13

Malta Bankers’ Association

h. Healthcare
The processing is necessary for healthcare purposes and is subject to suitable
safeguards.
i. Public health
The processing is necessary for public health purposes and is based on Union or
Member State law.
or
j. Archive
The processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
historical research purposes or statistical purposes and is based on Union or Member
State law.
Special categories of personal data
Banks may process special categories of personal data in relation to employees. Such data is
usually obtained from the employees themselves. When the processing of special categories
of data is necessary for the bank to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in
the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as it is
authorised by law, the employees’ explicit consent is not required for the processing of such
data. Strict levels of access and access rights apply in relation to special categories of
personal data, hence allowing access only to those officials who must essentially process
said data in the performance of their duties.
Examples of special categories of personal data:
(1) Data concerning cause of illness
As a rule, whenever a bank employee reports that he or she is unable to attend work due to
illness, the bank cannot request such employee to divulge the cause of his or her illness.
That said, banks may still send a medical practitioner and subject an employee to a medical
check-up, provided that the cause of illness is only processed by such practitioner, and the
bank will only receive confirmation as to whether the person was unfit for work. Should an
employee repeatedly report sick, or in the event of long-term illness, the bank can request
the medical practitioner to draw up a brief report on the employee, including where strictly
necessary general information on the employee’s medical condition, in order to enable the
assessment of his working capacity by the employer (vide Article 9 (2) (h)). The employee
should be informed accordingly.
(2) Pre-employment medical assessment
It is permissible for banks to request employees selected to be employed by the bank,
following a recruitment process, to attend a medical examination in order for a medical
professional to ascertain that they are fit for work. It is sufficient for the certificate issued by
the medical professional to state that the prospective employee is fit for work, with no
further details as to the diagnosis divulged therein. Should the certificate not give the
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

14

Malta Bankers’ Association

prospective employee a clean bill of health, banks may request further explanations from
the medical professional who would have assessed the candidate.
Should a candidate for a post not be recruited further to such medical assessment, the bank
should only retain records of such medical assessment or diagnosis for a period of four
months which is the legal period within which the candidate could contest the nonengagement by the employer (vide Article 30 (1) of the Employment and Industrial Relations
Act, Chapter 452 of the Laws of Malta). Should the bank decide to engage the employee
despite the negative diagnosis, the medical records relating to such an employee can be
retained in the file should the medical condition have an impact on the working
environment and in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the employee
himself/herself. In view of the sensitive nature of the data, this should be subject to strict
security measures and shall be kept separate from other HR records which are likely to be
processed as part of routine HR practices (e.g. payroll, CV, employment contract, benefits).

SECTION 6:
Article 10 – Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offences
Article 10 of the GDPR restricts the processing of personal data concerning legal offences.
Information about criminal convictions, offences or related security measures can be
processed only pursuant to Union or national law, or under the control of an official
authority. There are no other justifications. Even consent from the individual will not
provide a justification under the Regulation to process this type of personal data.
Processing concerning legal offences
Article 10 of the GDPR precludes the banks from processing data relating to offences,
criminal convictions or security measures.
(1) Bank customers
For the reasons elaborated upon in Section 3, it is critically important for the banks to
maintain relevant information to alert their lending officers to the risks of making new or
further advances to individuals who clearly do not qualify for such new or additional
lending. Therefore, the banks may retain, on a particular customer file, press cuttings/ other
information relating to court proceedings / convictions against that customer and similar
information on any other person (e.g. a debtor of the customer) where such information
may affect the relationship between the bank and the customer. This on the basis of
maintaining the recognised ‘Know Your Customer’ principle.
(2) Applicants for business
In so far as applicants for business are concerned, criminal record checks about an applicant
for business are carried out as part and parcel of the due diligence exercise which banks are
obliged to conduct in terms of Prevention of Money Laundering laws or any other law. The
decision as to whether a record of such checks is to be retained depends on whether or not
the bank decides to take the applicant on board as a client or not.
If the applicant becomes a client, it is imperative that the latter is informed of the data
being retained about him or her. It is important that strict retention periods for such data
are adhered to. In the case of information which is publicly available, the bank could link to
the official source rather than create its own record.
If an applicant for business is refused by the bank, the bank may wish to keep an annotation
of the fact in the eventuality that the same applicant seeks to re-apply. It is important that
any black lists created by the bank are not retained for longer than necessary to fulfil the
conduct of due diligence requirements. In the case of information which is publicly available
in relation to any such applicant for business, the bank could link to the official source rather
than create its own record. Banks can also retain a flagging to the effect that business was
declined due to diligence findings without maintaining any additional records.

(3) Recruitment
In terms of Section 7.4 of the FIAU’s Implementing Procedures on Anti-Money Laundering,
banks shall ensure that they have in place appropriate procedures for due diligence when
engaging employees. This would generally include obtaining professional references,
confirming employment history and qualifications and requesting a recent police conduct
certificate. Consequently, banks as employers are under obligation to process such data as
required in terms of the Implementing Procedures. In order to prove that they have abided
by such requirement, banks are allowed to process and keep copies of police conduct
certificates for selected candidates, given that such processing is deemed in compliance
with Article 6 (1) ( c ) of the GDPR as discussed in Section 3. That said, given its sensitivity,
such document shall be retained separately from other HR records which are accessed on a
regular basis by HR personnel.

SECTION 7:
Article 12 – Transparent information, communication and modalities for the
exercise of the rights of the data subject
Article 13 – Information to be provided where personal data are collected
from the data subject
Article 14 – Information to be provided where personal data have not been
obtained from the data subject
The Regulation makes provision for the information which must be provided in privacy
notices. It also requires controllers to ensure their privacy notices are “concise, transparent,
intelligible and easily accessible” (Article 12 (1) of the GDPR).
The information which must be included in the privacy notice is the following:















The identity and contact details of the controller and details of your representative
(where applicable).
The contact details of your data protection officer.
The purpose and legal basis of processing. Where legitimate interests are relied
upon, details of those interests.
The right to withdraw consent (if this is the basis for such processing).
The categories of personal data processed. This is only needed when personal data is
obtained from a third party.
The recipients or categories of recipients of personal data.
The source of the personal data, including use of public sources. This is only needed
when personal data is obtained from a third party.
Details of any intended transfer outside the Union. Details of any safeguards relied
upon and the means to obtain copies of transfer agreements.
The period for which data will be stored or the criteria used to determine this period.
A list of the individual’s rights as per Article 13 (2) (b) and Article 14 (2) (c) namely,
the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of
personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to
processing as well as the right to data portability .
Details of any automated decision making, including details of the logic used and
potential consequences for the individual.
Whether provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement,
whether disclosure is mandatory and the consequence of not disclosing personal
data. This is only needed when collecting personal data directly from the individual.
The right to complain to a supervisory authority.

A privacy notice must be supplied to data subjects at the time they provide you with their
personal data. If you obtain that personal data from or disclose it to a third party, the notice
must be provided:


within a reasonable time after obtaining the data, but at the latest within a month;

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

18

Malta Bankers’ Association



if the personal data is used to communicate with the individual, at the latest when that
communication is made; and



if the personal data is disclosed to a third party, at the latest when that data is disclosed.

If you obtain that personal data from a third party, there is no need to provide a privacy
notice if:


the data subject already has the information;



providing the information would be impossible or involve disproportionate effort,
particularly where the processing is for archiving, scientific or historical research purposes
or statistical purposes;



the obtaining or disclosure is pursuant to Union or Member State law and there are
appropriate measures to protect the data subject; or



the information is subject to professional secrecy.
Finally, if you process that personal data for a new purpose, you must give prior notification
to the data subject.
Article 12 (1) - Information to data subject
Banks must have in place a general privacy policy covering all types of data processing. They
should also have internal privacy policies dealing with the processing of specific types of
personal data, for instance, on cctv recordings, telephone recordings and also the
monitoring of email and internet usage of staff members. Apart from information within the
meaning of Article 13, such policies should provide detailed information the modalities
concerning the intended usage of such data, including the situations where the bank may
resort to such systems (e.g. review the CCTV recordings, or conduct specific monitoring
concerning email or internet usage).

Article 14 – Data Collected from other sources
It is normal for banks in the course of their business, to require references from third parties
on individuals who may be existing or prospective account holders, borrowers, guarantors,
etc. Such references are collected from third parties, including Credit Reference Agencies,
other banks, other existing customers and professional persons. Furthermore, banks may
request additional documentation from third parties such as professional references in
order to screen prospective employees as required under the FIAU Implementing
Procedures, or to fulfil obligations emanating from other laws or for any other purpose.

In all such cases, since the necessary information is being sourced by the bank from a third
party, the bank is obliged in terms of Article 14 of the GDPR to inform the potential
customer/employee of the fact that the bank is sourcing such information from a third party
and this upon first contact with the individual concerned. Within the context of the specific
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

19

scenarios described in the first paragraph above, the individual must therefore be so
informed upon applying for a particular facility or the opening of an account or upon
applying for a specific post with the bank.

SECTION 8: Article 15 – Right of access by the data subject
Individuals have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not
personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, a
copy of the personal data and the following information:










The purposes of the processing: The individual should have the right to verify the
lawfulness of the processing the bank is carrying out;
The categories of personal data concerned;
The recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will
be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations.
Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international
organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate
safeguards relating to the transfer (see Section 23);
Where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or,
if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
The existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of
personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data
subject or to object to such processing;
The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
Where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available
information as to their source;
The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful
information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
consequences of such processing for the data subject.

Whereas the controller must respond to the subject access request for free, a fee may be
charged if the individual asks for further copies of the personal data. The bank may also
refuse to respond to the request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive (or charge an
administrative fee). Where large volumes of personal data are processed, the individual
should specify exactly what information or processing the request relates to.
It must be possible to make requests electronically. Where such a request is made, the
information should also be provided electronically, unless otherwise requested by the
individual.
The controller is entitled to withhold personal data if disclosure would “adversely affect the
rights and freedoms of others” (Article 15 (4)).
With reference to the time for compliance in order to fulfil requests in relation to this
right, the right to reject any such request, or the right to impose a fee, reference should be
made to Section 15.
Article 15 – Right of access
1. Upon the request of a data subject, banks are obliged to provide to him/her not only
“confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed,
and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and” certain “information”, but
banks must also “provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing”. Strict
timelines as defined in Section 15 of these Guidelines must be adhered to.
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

21

2. In response to such requests, banks may not be aware of particular information that is
stored in files not pertaining directly to the person making the enquiry e.g. deceased
customers’ files containing details of the heirs, corporate client files containing details of
individual shareholders and directors, etc. . In such cases banks are not to be expected to
include such information in their response.
3. Any personal data relating to third parties and contained in the file of a customer making
a request should not be included in a reply to an access request unless the bank has
obtained the consent of such third party.
However in the case of a joint account, all parties to the account may have access to
information relating to transactions passed over that account, notwithstanding that some or
all of the transactions may have been originated by another joint account holder.
4. Article 15 (1) (h) of the GDPR requires banks responding to such requests to provide
information about “the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, . . . .
and, . . .., meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and
the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject”.
In this regard, no specific technical details or trade secrets should be divulged by the banks,
though the logical sequence of such processing would need to be explained.
5. Banks must accede to requests by data subjects to access CCTV recordings in which they
feature. This is so provided that such access does prejudice an ongoing criminal
investigation. It is also important to note that the identity of any third parties who feature
in such recordings must be masked or blurred.

SECTION 9: Article 16 – Right to rectification
Data subjects may request controllers to rectify personal data that has not been processed
in accordance with the GDPR, in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature
of the data. The controller shall immediately rectify or complete the data accordingly and
notify any third parties to whom data had been disclosed about the measures undertaken.
With reference to the time for compliance in order to fulfil requests in relation to this
right, the right to reject any such request, or the right to impose a fee, reference should be
made to Section 15.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

23

Malta Bankers’ Association

SECTION 10: Article 17 – Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)
The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data
concerning him or her. The bank must comply with the request where:


the individual has objected to the processing (other than in relation to objections to
direct marketing) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds to justify that
processing;



the personal data is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected or
processed;



the individual withdraws consent and there are no other grounds for the processing;



the personal data is unlawfully processed;



there is a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to erase the personal
data.

In all such cases, the controller must without undue delay erase the personal data processed
both manually and by electronic means. If he had made the personal data public, he must
take reasonable steps to inform other controllers of the request for erasure.
The controller does not need to comply with such a request if the processing is necessary:


for exercising rights of freedom of expression or information;



for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law;



in the public interest or carried out by an official authority;



for public interest in the area of public health;



for archiving or research; or



for legal claims.

With reference to the time for compliance in order to fulfil requests in relation to this
right, the right to reject any such request, or the right to impose a fee, reference should be
made to Section 15.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

24

Malta Bankers’ Association

SECTION 11: Article 18 – Right to restriction of processing
The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing. You
must comply with the request where:





the individual has objected to the processing and you are considering if there are
overriding legitimate grounds that justify continued processing;
the processing is no longer necessary but retention of the data is needed by the data
subject to deal with legal claims;
the processing is unlawful but the individual wants the data to be restricted not
erased; or
the accuracy of the personal data is being contested and the controller is verifying
that data.

Where data is restricted, you may only process personal data:





with consent of the data subject;
for legal claims;
for protection of the rights and freedoms of others; or
for reasons of important public interest.

The data subject shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing
is lifted.
Controllers need to ensure that their systems are set up to identify restricted personal data
and to limit access to that data.
With reference to the time for compliance in order to fulfil requests in relation to this
right, the right to reject any such request, or the right to impose a fee, reference should be
made to Section 15.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

25

Malta Bankers’ Association

SECTION 12: Article 20 – Right to data portability
Individuals already have a right to access their personal data through a subject access
request (see Section 8). Data portability enhances this right, giving the individual the right to
get that personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format.
Individuals can also ask for the data to be transferred directly from one controller to
another, where technically feasible (Article 20 (2)). There is no right to charge fees for this
service.
However, this right:


only applies where the controller is processing personal data in reliance on the
processing conditions of consent or performance of a contract.



only applies if the data processing is carried out by automated means and
therefore does not cover paper files.



only applies to personal data concerning data subject.
You can only exercise the right to data portability with regard to personal data.
Therefore, any data, which is anonymous or does not concern the data subject,
cannot be requested. However, a data subject may request portability of
pseudonymous data that can be clearly linked to the data subject (e.g. by him or her
providing the respective identifier – Article 11 (2)).



only applies to personal data “provided to” the controller.
There are many examples of personal data which will be knowingly and actively
“provided by” the data subject such as account data (e.g. mailing address, user
name, age) submitted via online forms. Nevertheless, the data controller must also
include the personal data that are generated by and collected from the activities of
users in response to a data portability request, that is, raw data. This latter category
of data does not include data that are exclusively generated by the data controller,
such as a user profile created by analysis of the raw data collected.

A distinction can be made between different categories of data, depending on their origin,
to determine if they are covered by the right to data portability. The following categories
can be qualified as “provided by the data subject”:
- Data actively and knowingly provided by the data subject are included in the scope of the
right to data portability (for example, mailing address, user name, age, etc.);
- Observed data are “provided” by the data subject by virtue of the use of the service or
the device. They may for example include a person’s search history. It may also include
other raw data.

In contrast, inferred data and derived data are created by the data controller on the basis of
the data “provided by the data subject”. These personal data do not fall within the scope of
the right to data portability. For example, a credit score is a typical example of inferred data.
Even though such data may be part of a profile kept by a data controller and are inferred or
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

26

Malta Bankers’ Association

derived from the analysis of data provided by the data subject, this data will typically not be
considered as “provided by the data subject” and thus will not be within scope of the data
portability right.
Nevertheless, the data subject can still exercise his or her “right to obtain from the
controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being
processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data” as well as information
about “the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article
22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved,
as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data
subject”. (Article 15 refers).
The term “provided by the data subject” must be interpreted broadly, and only to exclude
“inferred data” and “derived data”, which include personal data that are generated by a
service provider (for example, algorithmic results). A data controller can exclude those
inferred data but should include all other personal data provided by the data subject
through technical means provided by the controller. This includes all data observed about
the data subject during the activities for the purpose of which the data are collected, such
as a transaction history or access log. Data collected through the tracking and recording of
the data subject (such as technology used to track browsing behaviour) should also be
considered as “provided by” him or her, even if the data are not actively or consciously
transmitted.
Thus, the terms “provided by” includes personal data that relate to the data subject
activity or result from the observation of an individual’s behaviour but not subsequent
analysis of that behaviour. By contrast, any personal data which have been generated by
the data controller as part of the data processing, e.g. by a personalisation or
recommendation process, by user categorisation or profiling are data which are derived or
inferred from the personal data provided by the data subject, and are not covered by the
right to data portability.


The right to data portability must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
others.

This condition intends to avoid retrieval and transmission of data containing the personal
data of other (non-consenting) data subjects to a new data controller in cases where these
data are likely to be processed in a way that would adversely affect the rights and freedoms
of the other data subjects (Article 20(4) of the GDPR). Such an adverse effect would occur,
for instance, if the transmission of data from one data controller to another, under the right
to data portability, would prevent third parties from exercising their rights as data subjects
under the GDPR (such as the rights to information, access, etc.).
The data subject initiating the transmission of his or her data to another data controller
either gives consent to the new data controller for processing or enters into a contract with
them. Where personal data of third parties are included in the data set, another ground for
lawfulness of processing must be identified. For example, a legitimate interest under Article
6(1)(f) may be pursued by the data controller to whom the data is transmitted, in particular
when the purpose of the data controller is to provide a service to the data subject that
allows the latter to process personal data for a purely personal or household activity.
For example, when a data subject exercises his/her right to data portability on his/her bank
account, such an account can contain personal data relating to the purchases and
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks
27

Malta Bankers’ Association

transactions of the account holder but also information relating to transactions, which have
been “provided by” other individuals who have transferred money to the account holder. In
this context, the rights and freedoms of the third parties are unlikely to be adversely
affected in the webmail transmission or the bank account history transmission, if their data
are used for the same purpose in each processing, i.e. as a contact address only used by the
data subject, or as a history of one of the data subject’s bank account. Conversely, their
rights and freedoms will not be respected if the new data controller uses the contact
directory for marketing purposes.
Therefore, to prevent adverse effects on the third parties involved, the processing of such a
directory by another controller is allowed only to the extent that the data are kept under
the sole control of the requesting user and is only managed for purely personal or
household needs. A receiving ‘new’ data controller (to whom the data can be transmitted at
the request of the user) may not use the transmitted third party data for his own purposes
e.g. to propose marketing products and services to those other data subjects. Otherwise,
such processing is likely to be unlawful and unfair, especially if the third parties concerned
are not informed and cannot exercise their rights as data subjects.
To further help reduce the risks for other data subjects whose personal data may be ported,
all data controllers (both the ‘sending’ and the ‘receiving’ parties) should implement tools to
enable data subjects to select the relevant data and exclude (where relevant) other data
subjects’ data. Additionally, they should implement consent mechanisms for other data
subjects involved, to ease data transmission for those cases where such parties are willing
to consent, e.g. because they as well want to move their data to some other data controller.
Such a situation might arise with social networks.
Data controllers must clearly explain the difference between the types of data that a data
subject can receive using the portability right or the access right. It is also recommended
that data controllers always include information about the right to data portability before
any account closure. This allows users to take stock of their personal data, and to easily
transmit the data to their own device or to another provider before a contract is
terminated. As a best practice for “receiving” data, controllers ought to provide data
subjects with complete information about the nature of personal data which are relevant
for the performance of their services. This allows users to limit the risks for third parties,
and also any other unnecessary duplication of personal data even where no other data
subjects are involved.
With reference to the time for compliance in order to fulfil requests in relation to this
right, the right to reject any such request, or the right to impose a fee, reference should be
made to Section 15.
For guidance on the following questions, refer to attached Annex III to these guidelines:


How can the data controller identify the data subject before answering his
request?



What is the expected data format?



How do you deal with a large or complex personal data collection?

SECTION 13: Article 21 – Right to object
When the processing is legitimised on the basis of the controller’s legitimate interests or
based on the necessity of performing a task in the public interest, the data subject has the
right to object at any time to the processing of his/her personal data, including any profiling.
The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller can
demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing which override the
interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or in order for the establishment to
exercise or defend legal claims.

Right to object to direct marketing
The Regulation provides that individuals have the right to object to direct marketing (Article
21 (2) and (3)). When an individual exercises this right, the bank must not only stop sending
direct marketing material to the individual, but also stop any processing of that individual’s
personal data for marketing purposes. For example, in the case of an objection from a data
subject, the bank should stop profiling that individual for the purposes of direct marketing.
The e-Privacy Directive 2002/58EC, transposed under the local statute by virtue of
Subsidiary Legislation 440.01, contains specific obligations for direct marketing by electronic
means, and in principle, requires the prior consent of the individual. The e-Privacy Directive
is still applicable.
With reference to the time for compliance in order to fulfil requests in relation to this
right, the right to reject any such request, or the right to impose a fee, reference should be
made to Section 15.

Article 21 (2) and (3) – Direct marketing
Communication for direct marketing purposes by means of an automatic calling machine, a
facsimile machine or electronic mail are regulated by Subsidiary Legislation 440.01, and are
hereunder referred to as ‘communication by electronic means’. SMS adverts and other
forms of electronic messaging including instant messages (e.g. via social media or other
similar platforms) are also considered as electronic mail for the purposes of such regulation.
All other types of communications for direct marketing purposes are referred to as
‘conventional mail’.
Communication for direct marketing purposes of third party products or services (that is,
products or services offered by a separate legal entity other than the bank itself which is
conducting the advertising) via any medium whatsoever, (that is, whether via conventional
mail, by electronic means or printed on any type of stationery issued by banks) always
requires the explicit consent of the customer.
1)

Conventional Mail

The processing of legitimately collected personal data for direct marketing purposes is
allowed as long as the data subject does not give notice to the controller that he opposes it.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

30

Malta Bankers’ Association

The controller is duty bound to appropriately inform the data subject of his right to oppose,
at no cost, the processing for direct marketing purposes.
The provisions of Article 13 (2) (b) of the GDPR require that information about the right to
oppose is appropriately given by the bank to its customers. In practice, this is normally done
at the beginning of a relationship.
If no objection has been/ is received, banks may continue to process these customers’ data
for direct marketing purposes by conventional mail.
2)

Communication by Electronic Means

Regulation 9 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 440.01 prohibits the use of an automatic calling
machine, or a facsimile machine, or electronic mail to make an unsolicited communication
to a subscriber (whether a natural person or a legal person) for the purpose of direct
marketing, unless that subscriber has given his prior consent in writing to the receipt of
such a communication.
However, Regulation 9 (2) of Subsidiary Legislation 440.01 allows some leeway in this
regard, in that where a customer’s contact details for electronic mail have been obtained by
a bank ‘…in relation to the sale of a product or service’, that bank may use such contact
details ‘…for direct marketing of its own similar products or services.’ But this leeway comes
with a Proviso: ‘That customers shall be given the opportunity to object … to such use of
electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message
where the customer has not initially refused such use’.

3)

Marketing material with stationery issued by banks

Stationery issued by banks, such as bank account statements, ATM receipts, transaction
vouchers etc. may contain general additional information about the services offered by the
bank or that of a third party. This information is not considered equivalent to direct
marketing, provided that such communication is general in nature and not specifically
tailored or targeted to a customer or group of customers based on their profile. By way of
example, leaflets, circulars, inserts, accompanying Bank’s stationery, but which are sent
indiscriminately and which are not specifically addressed to an individual, would in principle,
fall outside the scope of direct marketing. The same applies to information or advertising
messages which are printed on the bank’s stationery material, provided that there is no
evidence to suggest that these messages are specifically targeted to the recipient.

SECTION 14:
Article 22 – Automated individual decision–making, including profiling
Individuals have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated
processing that produce legal effects or significantly affect the individual (Article 22).
However, this right does not apply where the decision is:


based on explicit consent from the individual, subject to suitable safeguards,
including a right for a human review of the decision;



necessary for a contract with the individual, subject to suitable safeguards, including
a right for a human review of the decision; or



authorised by EU or national law.

Additional restrictions apply to automated decision making or profiling using special
categories of personal data or when carried out on children.
With reference to the time for compliance in order to fulfil requests in relation to this
right, the right to reject any such request, or the right to impose a fee, reference should be
made to Section 15.

Article 22 – Decisions based on automated processing
This Article applies in particular to credit scoring. Where the outcome of such scoring
results in a request for credit facilities being declined, the applicant is entitled to:
1.
2.

Request that the decision be reconsidered other than in a manner based solely on
automated processing.
Obtain information from the bank about what has controlled the automated
processing that resulted in the negative decision.

Such obligations would not apply in those cases where the decision is necessary for entering
into, or the performance of, a contract between the controller and data subject, or if it is
established by a law laying down suitable safeguards and measures to protect the subject.
In any case, banks would have an obligation under Article 13 or 14, to inform data subjects
about the existence of automated decision-making, by providing meaningful information
about the logic involved and the consequences envisaged for the data subject. The bank,
however, is not obliged to reveal specific information about the algorithm involved or the
computations leading to a credit score. No specific technical details or trade secrets need to
be divulged.

SECTION 15:
Other provisions relating to the rights of data subjects under Articles 15 to 22
15.1: Time for compliance by the data controller in order to fulfil requests by data subjects:
Article 12 (3) provides that the data controller must comply with the exercise of all the
captioned rights “without undue delay” and in any case “within one month of receipt of
the request” or within a maximum of three months for complex cases, provided that the
data subject has been informed about the reasons for such delay within one month of the
original request.
Data controllers who do not take action on any request of the data subject must indicate to
the data subject “the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a
complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy”, no later than one
month after receiving the request.
Data controllers must respect the obligation to respond within the given terms, even if it
concerns a refusal. In other words, the data controller cannot remain silent when it is
asked to answer a request.
15.2: In which cases can a request be rejected or a fee be charged?
Article 12 (5) prohibits the data controller from charging a fee for “any communication and
any actions taken” in fulfilment of the captioned rights of the data subject, unless the data
controller can demonstrate that the requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, “in
particular because of their repetitive character”. In the latter case, the controller can refuse
to act on the request but bears the burden of proving the manifestly unfounded or
excessive character of the request.
The overall cost of the processes to answer requests, such as data portability requests,
should not be taken into account to determine the excessiveness of a request. The overall
system implementation costs should neither be charged to the data subjects, nor be used to
justify a refusal to answer requests.

SECTION 16: Article 25 – Data protection by design and by default
The Regulation makes specific provisions on the use of technical and organisational
measures tailored to enhance the level of data protection compliance. When deploying
systems, applications, products or services that rely on the processing of personal data to
fulfil their tasks, banks should take into account the right to data protection and should
encourage their IT department or IT service providers, including developers, to design
products or services that contain technical measures which are data protection friendly,
embedded in the design.
Such measures could consist inter alia of:










Facilitating data controllers in creating and improving security measures;
Data minimisation and pseudonymisation;
Transparency both in relation to processing and the functions within an organisation;
Default settings which limit the processing of personal data to what is strictly
necessary;
Features enabling data subjects to have more control on their personal data
including its access and further usage;
Measures protecting data subjects’ rights;
Strong access controls including audit trails and flagging systems;
Data segregation mechanisms;
Automated deletion or anonymisation of personal data upon expiry of the storage
period.

Similar measures shall be taken into consideration when issuing tenders for such services
and in any case, well before the product design.

SECTION 17: Article 28 – Processor (Outsourcing)
The GDPR impacts on all aspects of the processing relationship, from how to choose a
processor, to what to include in the processing contract and how data is dealt with at the
end of that arrangement. It also impacts heavily on the risks associated with processing
personal data for both controllers and processors, which in turn affects the contractual risk
allocation between those parties.
Choosing a processor
Under the GDPR controllers can only use processors “providing sufficient guarantees to
implement appropriate technical and organisational measures so that the processing meets
the requirements of GDPR and ensures the protection of the rights of data subjects.”
This is much broader than the current requirements and means that controllers must carry
out a broader due diligence exercise when selecting a processor. Controllers may therefore
consider whether it is necessary, or good practice, to carry out a data protection impact
assessment (DPIA) before entering into a major new processing arrangement.
Negotiating a processor contract
The GDPR requires that whenever processing is carried out on behalf of a controller by a
third party, such parties must enter into a written agreement (including in electronic form).
The said agreement must clearly abide by the below requirements:

Article
28 (3)

28(3) (a)

28 (3) (b)
28 (3) (c)
28 (3) (d)

28 (3) (e)
28 (3) (f)

28 (3) (g)

Requirement
Processing by a processor must be governed by a contract that is binding on the
processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter
and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the
type of personal data, categories of individuals whose data is being processed
and the obligations and rights of the controller. The contract must stipulate, in
particular, that the processor will:
process only on documented instructions, including with regard to transfers of
personal data to a third country or to an international organisation (unless,
subject to certain restrictions, legally required to transfer to a third country or
international organisation);
ensure those processing personal data are under a confidentiality obligation
(contractual or statutory);
take all measures required under the security provisions (Article 32) which
includes pseudonymising and encrypting personal data as appropriate;
only use a sub-processor with the controller’s consent (specific or general,
although where general consent is obtained processors must notify changes to
controllers, giving them an opportunity to object);
flow down the same contractual obligations to sub-processors;
assist the controller in responding to requests from individuals (data subjects)
exercising their rights;
assist the controller in complying with the obligations relating to security,
breach notification, DPIAs and consulting with supervisory authorities (Articles
32-36);
delete or return (at the controller’s choice) all personal data at the end of the

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

35

Malta Bankers’ Association

28 (3) (h)

agreement (unless storage is required by EU/member state law);
make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate
compliance; allow/contribute to audits (including inspections); and inform the
controller if its instructions infringe data protection law.

It is important to note that while processors have some direct obligations, controllers still
have more extensive liability than processors under the GDPR. They remain liable for all
damage caused by processing which infringes the GDPR, whereas processors are only liable
under the GDPR when they breach processor specific provisions or act outside the
controller’s instructions. Controllers are often reliant on processors to enable them to fulfil
their legal obligations. Despite the detailed nature of Article 28(3), there are instances
where banks, as controllers, may want to go beyond the GDPR’s contractual requirements .
For example, in relation to breach notification, controllers have an obligation to notify their
supervisory authority of a data breach without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72
hours from the moment that they become aware of such breach. However, processors only
have a duty to notify their controllers ‘without undue delay’. In this regard, controllers
should consider including specific terms in their contractual agreement with the processor,
requiring them to notify the breach promptly and within an established timeframe, such as
24hrs.
In terms of Article 28 (7) and (8), both the European Commission and the supervisory
authority may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters alluded to above.

SECTION 18: Article 30 – Records of processing activities
Banks are no longer obliged to notify data processing activities to the Data Protection
Commissioner. However, in view of the processing activities concerning regular and
systematic monitoring of data subjects which are deemed to involve risks on the rights and
freedoms of individuals, and also taking into account the processing of special categories of
personal data, criminal convictions and offences, banks are subject to the record-keeping
obligations emanating from Article 30.
Controllers:
If you act as a controller, you must keep a record of the following information:


your name and contact details and, where applicable, any joint controllers,
representatives and data protection officers;



the purposes of the processing;



a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal
data;



the categories of recipients, including recipients in third countries or international
organisations;



details of transfers of personal data to third countries (where applicable);



retention periods for different categories of personal data (where possible); and



a general description of the security measures employed (where possible).

Processor
If you act as a data processor, you must keep the following records:


your name and contact details and, where applicable, representatives and data
protection officers;



the name and contact details of each controller you act for including, where
applicable, representatives and data protection officers;



the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;



details of transfers of personal data to third countries (where applicable);



a general description of the security measures employed (where possible).

Data protection impact assessment
The Regulation makes a privacy impact assessment mandatory for any new project that is
likely to create “high risks” for individuals. The process for carrying out this assessment is set
out below: activity


Is the processing likely to be “high risk”?

High risk processing includes:


systematic and extensive profiling that produces legal effects or significantly affects
individuals;



processing special categories of personal data on a large scale; and



systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale (e.g. CCTV).

The supervisory authority may identify other processing as being “high risk”.
If yes, you must carry out an assessment. Your data protection impact assessment must be
documented and must contain the following information:


a description of the processing, including its purposes and any legitimate interests
pursued by the controller;



an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing;



an assessment of the risks to individuals; and



the measures taken to address those risks.

You must seek advice from your data protection officer and may have to consult with
affected individuals or their representatives


Is the processing still “high risk”? Does the assessment indicate your processing is
high risk in spite of measures taken to mitigate that risk?

If yes, you must consult your supervisory authority. The supervisory authority will consider
if your processing is compatible with the Regulation.
The supervisory authority should respond within eight weeks, but can extend this period by
a further six weeks if extra time is needed due to the complexity of the processing. These
time periods are suspended during periods in which the supervisory authority is waiting for
further information from the banks.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

SECTION 19: Article 32 – Security of processing
The Regulation requires banks to keep personal data secure. They are to take appropriate
technical and organisational measures to protect their systems. This broad obligation is
supplemented by additional obligations to take the following steps, where appropriate
(Article 32):


the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;



the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
of its information technology systems;



the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner
in the event of a physical or technical incident; and



a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical
and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

SECTION 20:
Article 33 – Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory
authority
Article 34 – Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject
In terms of Articles 33 and 34 of the Regulation, controllers are obliged to notify the
supervisory authority and, in some cases, individuals, of personal data breaches unless the
personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons.
The Article 29 Working Party issued guidelines on Personal Data Breach Notification, which
were adopted in October 2017 and revised on 6th February 2018.
A personal data breach is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful
destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. It is
potentially very broad. It is not limited to loss of data and extends to unauthorised access or
alteration. However, it only captures actual breaches and not suspected breaches.
Where a personal data breach occurs as a result of cross-border data processing, or where it
will substantially affect data subjects in more than one EU jurisdiction, this will lead to the
use of the one-stop-shop mechanism, as contemplated under Article 60 of the GDPR. This is
relevant in the case of banks having multiple establishments across the EU.
Is the breach a “risk”?
You must consider if the personal data breach is likely to be a risk to individuals. There is a
“risk” to individuals if processing could lead to physical, material or non-material damage.
This includes profiling or processing that could lead to discrimination, identity theft, damage
to reputation or reversal of pseudonymisation. It includes any processing of special
categories of personal data or personal data of children or other vulnerable persons or
processing that involves large amounts of personal data.
If NO, notification is not required. However, you must document the personal data breach.
If YES, you must notify the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible,
within 72 hours from when you become aware of the breach. That notification should
contain specified details of the breach. If you cannot provide all of those details
immediately, you can provide them in stages. In order to facilitate such notification, the
Information and Data Protection Commissioner will make available a specific form on the
website www.idpc.org.mt.
Is the breach “high risk”?
You must consider if the breach is a high risk for individuals. The breach will not be high risk
if the data is encrypted or other protective measures are in place.
If NO, no further notification is required. The process is at an end.
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

40

Malta Bankers’ Association

If YES, you must inform the affected individuals. You must provide affected individuals with
details of the personal data breach without undue delay (though there is no fixed deadline).
If informing the affected individuals directly would involve disproportionate effort, you may
be able to use an alternative means of public communication, e.g. newspaper adverts.
You must keep a record of all security breaches, regardless of whether they need to be
notified to the supervisory authority.
In view of the above, banks need to: of t


Consider setting up a central breach management unit to collate, review and notify
breaches, where appropriate.



Review and update their security measures in light of the increased security
obligations in the Regulation.

SECTION 21: Article 35 – Data protection impact assessment
Article 35 – Data Protection Impact Assessment
The GDPR imposes a legal obligation on banks to conduct a data protection impact
assessment for any processing that is likely to create “high risks” for customers (see Section
18). Bank activities which can be considered to involve high risk processing, include
conducting due diligence and especially enhanced due diligence in relation to any potential
or existing customer as well as profiling of clients. Profiling activities which may lead to
decisions including those by automated means, which have significant effects on data
subjects, such as for example credit scoring, are considered to create high risk and would
require an impact assessment.

SECTION 22: Article 37 – Designation of the data protection officer
In terms of Article 37 (1) (b) of the Regulation, banks are obliged to appoint a data
protection officer.
The role of the data protection officer
The data protection officer is responsible for monitoring compliance with the Regulation,
providing information and advice, and liaising with the supervisory authority. The data
protection officer:


must report to the highest level of management within your business;



must be able to operate independently and not be dismissed or penalised for
performing his/her tasks; but



can have other roles so long as they do not give rise to a conflict of interests (i.e. this
does not have to be a full-time role).

SECTION 23:
Article 46 – Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards
Article 49 – Derogations for specific situations
A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take
place where the European Commission has decided that the third country or one or more
specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question,
ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific
authorisation.
Otherwise, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data outside the Union, unless
certain conditions are met by the controller or processor. The safeguards which must be in
place are any of the following:









A legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies;
Binding corporate rules approved by the competent supervisory authority;
Standard data protection clauses adopted by either the European Commission or by
a supervisory authority and approved by the Commission;
An approved code of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments
of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate
safeguards as regards data subjects’ rights;
An approved certification mechanism together with binding and enforceable
commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the
appropriate safeguards as regards data subjects’ rights;
Contractual clauses between the controller or processor and the controller,
processor or the recipient of the personal data in the third country authorised by the
competent supervisory authority;
Provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements between public
authorities or bodies which include enforceable and effective data subject rights and
authorised by the competent authority.

Therefore, in line with the above:
i.
It will be possible to transfer personal data to a person outside the Union where the
importer and exporter enter into the so-called Model Contracts. It is possible to enter into
multiparty Model Contracts, commonly known as intra-group agreements. The existing
controller-controller and controller-processor Model Contracts will be grandfathered.
Where standard clauses approved by the Commission are used, authorisation from a
supervisory authority will no longer be required.
ii.
Transfers to third countries are possible if the importer has signed up to suitable
Codes of Conduct or obtained suitable Certification.
iii.

Binding corporate rules (BCRs) are a set of binding obligations under which a group
of undertakings commit to process personal data in accordance with the Regulation.
BCRs have been put on a statutory footing and will be available to both controllers
and processors.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

44

Malta Bankers’ Association

Banks could therefore consider implementing a “structural” transfer solution (such as
binding corporate rules or an intra-group agreement) as these provide a general
justification for your transfers.
In the case of transfer authorisations issued by the Commissioner on the basis of adequate
safeguards (e.g. model clauses) prior to the GDPR, such transfers shall remain valid until
amended, replaced or repealed, as may be necessary by the Commissioner.
The GDPR makes provisions for a number of specific situations where a transfer can take
place even in the absence of the safeguards discussed above (Article 49 (1)). The below
however, shall be narrowly interpreted and used in exceptional circumstances.








there is the explicit consent of the data subject;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual or in
the
individual’s interest;
necessary for important reasons of public interest. That public interest must be
recognised under Union or Member State law;
necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
necessary for the vital interests of an individual where the individual is unable to give
consent; or
the transfer is made from a public register.

The GDPR also introduces a new exemption for minor transfers which is only available in
limited situations. It was intended to legitimise one-off or occasional transfers of personal
data, for example where employees take their laptop with them on holiday or email a
person who happens to be outside the Union. The requirements to invoke the minor
transfer exemption are the following:







No other justification could be used
The transfer is not repetitive
Only limited data subjects are affected
Supervisory authority and data subjects are informed of the transfer
The risks have been assessed and safeguards applied
There is a compelling interest not overridden by the individuals’ interests

Articles 44 to 50 – Transfer of data to a third country / Exemptions from the prohibition
of the transfer of data to a third country
In so far as cross-border credit transfers via SWIFT are concerned, it is to be clarified that
such transfers are effected upon the application of the ordering customer who, by signing
the transfer order, is also implicitly giving his consent to the transfer of the personal data
contained in the transfer order to the jurisdiction where recipient of such transfer is
located. However, banks are to inform their customers that pursuant to an Agreement
between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and
transfer of Financial Messaging Data for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking
Program (TFTP), their personal data could be disclosed to the U. S. authorities. MBA
members have agreed to use the following wording in order to notify bank customers:
“Personal data in relation to transactions effected via SWIFT (Society for Worldwide
Interbank Financial Telecommunication) may be required to be disclosed to the United
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

45

Malta Bankers’ Association

States authorities in order to comply with legal requirements applicable in the United
States for the prevention of crime and in accordance with the EU-US Terrorist Finance
Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement”.
Other bank activities which often require the transfer of data to third countries and hence
need to comply with the legal requirements set out in this Section, include offshoring
activities which may be intra-group initiatives or may involve the use of a third party
service provider such as, for example, the use of cloud services.
In the absence of a decision by the EU Commission recognising the third country to which a
transfer is envisaged as adequate in terms of the data protection regime, banks would
need to ensure that the transfers are subject to adequate safeguards and guarantees
which are essentially equivalent to those afforded by EU law. In this regard, adequacy
instruments which are recognised by the EU Commission for such purposes (e.g. EU
Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules), shall be considered depending
on their suitability for the type and nature of transfer.

SECTION 24: Article 48 – Transfers or disclosures not authorised by Union law
In terms of Article 48:
“Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a
third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may
only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement,
such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and
the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other grounds for transfer...”
As such, banks should respond to such requests only if they are routed through the
competent national authority.

Annex I

Archival Material Retention Periods
Preamble: This document reflects, inter alia, the requirements of:






Regulations 4(11) and 4(13) of the Cooperation with Other Jurisdictions on Tax
Matters Regulations (S.L.123.127).
Article 163 of the Companies Act, Cap. 386.
Article 19 of the Income Tax Management Act, Cap. 372.
Regulation 13 of the Prevention of Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism
Regulations (S.L.373.01)
Conduct of Business Rulebook Phase II

A copy of each of these enactments is attached to this document for easier reference.
1. Scope:
The scope of this document is to set out industry standards to be adopted by member
banks regarding the retention periods to be applied by them in relation to all
documentation / material which is sent for archiving.
To this end, the document outlines the respective retention periods applicable to the
various categories of documents which are sent for archiving, the “trigger date” for the
start of such retention periods, and the form (original / scanned / electronic) in which the
various documents should be retained for archiving purposes.
2. Definitions:
2.1. Account data is defined as electronic data which relates to all aspects of an
account, excluding transaction data. It is often referred to as static data since,
unlike transaction data, it does not change that often. Examples of account data
include a customer’s Final Withholding Tax instructions, opening of account details,
mailing addresses, and residence status. Account data would typically consist of
alphanumeric characters.
2.2. Account information is similar to account data, but it can either take the form of a
paper record, or alternatively, it can be a full scan of the document concerned. The
difference between account data and account information is that the latter would
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

48

Malta Bankers’ Association

typically not be limited to alphanumeric inputs, but would include also signatures
as well as pre-printed clauses. An opening of account form, be it original or
scanned, would typically qualify as being account information. By contrast, the
details of that form, as captured through a keyboard or similar device, would be
called account data.
2.3. Transaction data is defined as electronic data which relates to the various debit or
credit transactions that would pass through the account over the years. Examples
of transaction data include the amount, details of payment, etc. Transaction data
would typically consist of alphanumeric characters, and may cover all type of
accounts, be they customer accounts or general ledger accounts.
2.4. Transaction information is similar to transaction data, but transaction information
would typically reside on paper or is scanned. Compared with transaction data,
transaction information would typically include the customer’s signature as well as
pre-printed clauses. A cheque or a voucher, be it original or scanned, would
typically qualify as being transaction information. By contrast, the alphanumeric
details of that cheque, as captured through an electronic device such as a
keyboard, would then be called transaction data.
3. General points:
3.1. Each member bank is to adhere to the time period stipulated in this agreement.
3.2. Each member bank has the option to archive documents in paper and/or in
scanned format, provided that the scan covers all the required information,
including signatures and pre-printed clauses. There are four exceptions to this
clause, namely:
3.2.1. ...cheques and other documents containing customers’ signatures. Such
documents must be held in their original paper format for a period of one
year from date of presentation / creation of the document.
3.2.2. ...where the bank obtains documents certified by third parties (i.e. not being
officers or employees of the subject person) in fulfilment of their obligations
under the Implementing Procedures issued by the Financial Intelligence
Analysis Unit. In such cases, banks should retain on file the physical
document certified by the third party and not a copy thereof (Section 5.4 of
the Implementing Procedures).
3.2.3. ...obsolete collateral (security) documents. Such documents should be
retained in their original format, except where the bank is obliged to return
the original document (e.g. guarantees issued in favour of the bank by
another bank).
3.2.4. ...obsolete Powers of Attorney. Such documents should be retained in their
original format.
3.3. The start date for the retention period shall vary from one case to another, as
explained in section five of this document.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

49

Malta Bankers’ Association

4. The various categories of retention periods:
4.1. All documentation which the bank is required to keep in terms of Article 163 of the
Companies Act and / or Article 19 of the Income Tax Management Act, must be
retained for a period of ten years, starting from the end of the relative financial
year. This typically includes all the documentation which relates to the day-to-day
administration of the bank, such as payroll, purchases, utility bills, travelling
expenses, capital expenditure, etc. This provision also includes a requirement to
hold, for ten years, a full set of audited accounts, supported by all relevant working
papers and computer generated reports detailing interest paid and received,
exchange revaluation workings, etc. Such information may be retained in paper
and / or in scanned or electronic formats.
4.2. All transaction data (see definition) is to be retained for a period of ten years from
the date of the transaction.
4.3. All account data (see definition) is to be retained for a period of ten years from the
date of closure of the respective account.
4.4. In so far as the retention of records which pertain to the following categories,
Member Banks shall distinguish between the different categories as follows:
4.4.1 Telephone recordings
The retention period for telephone recordings varies depending on the purpose
for processing such recordings.
(i) Telephone recordings which are the only proof of a debit authority or of a contract
including those telephone conversations relating to transactions concluded when dealing
on own account, and the provision of client order services that relate to the reception,
transmission and execution of client orders, will be retained for a period of ten years
from date of recording.
(ii) In all other cases, telephone recordings ought not to be kept for a period longer than
thirty days.
(iii) Banks can exercise their own discretion in so far as telephone recordings which are
used for training purposes are concerned, provided that the recordings are edited to
ensure that no personal data is revealed and the identity of the caller and as much as
possible the voice of the same caller are rendered non-identifiable.

4.4.2

Video recordings
Video recordings should not be retained for a period longer than necessary.

(i) In so far as customer-facing footage is concerned, such period shall not be longer
than 30 days, provided that where specific footage is used in connection with an
investigation, a copy of the relevant extract from the recordings may be retained as
evidence until the case is concluded.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

50

Malta Bankers’ Association

(ii) Back-office operations footage does not as a rule capture the faces of the
employees, but only their hands and the cash handling process. In such cases, the
footage of back-office operations can be kept for a period which is not longer than 90
days.

4.4.3 Staff records
Staff records shall also be subject to pre-defined retention periods, based on the purpose
of processing and subject to operational and legal requirements applicable to such data.
In this regard, banks shall distinguish between personal data which relates to records
being renewed periodically (e.g. attendance, vacation leave, sick leave records) and
which therefore may be substituted by or updated with new records on an annual basis,
and other information which will be necessary for the entire duration of the employment
relationship (e.g. employment contract, payroll and other financial records,
qualifications, training, performance records and appraisals).
In the case of attendance, sick leave and vacation leave records, banks should determine
internal practices as to the period within which any concerns or disputes may be raised
internally on such matters, unless there are additional time frames stipulated by law. In
these instances, and unless specific disputes arise, a maximum retention period of one
year is deemed sufficient.
With regards to other staff records which are deemed necessary throughout the entirety
of the employment relationship, retention periods shall be established from the date
when the employment contract is terminated. Financial records are subject to obligations
emanating from the Income Tax Act, and therefore shall be retained for ten years
following termination of employment. In the case of other employment records, banks
shall take into consideration possible legal action or claims for damages that may arise
after termination of employment (e.g. unfair dismissal, bullying, sexual harassment,
occupational health and safety, injury at work). Taking into account the possible legal
prescriptive periods, a maximum retention period of five years after termination is
deemed sufficient.
The abovementioned retention periods are without prejudice and may be superseded by
general guidelines or code of ethics issued in the field of HR and employment, as may be
approved from time to time by the Commissioner.

4.4.5 Internal documentation such as circulars, obsolete handbook procedures and
documentation and communication records as exchanged with third parties other than
with customers (such as with suppliers)
The retention period for these categories, provided that there is no personal data, is left
at the discretion of the bank.

4.5. Deceased customers’ files are to be retained for a period of ten years from when the
account balance was fully distributed to the heirs.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

51

Malta Bankers’ Association

5. The “trigger date” for the start of the retention period:
5.1. The “trigger date” for transaction data, account data, deceased customers’ files,
and for other requirements as stipulated by the Companies Act and / or by article
19 of the Income Tax Management Act, have all been explained under section four
above.
5.2. Transaction information (see definition) is typically held in paper format or as a full
scan. Such records are to be held for a period of six years from date of transaction.
Banks usually refer to this as the “daily waste”. After six years, the bank may
therefore destroy such paper records or scanned images. In so doing, the bank
would then be relying on the corresponding transaction data (see definition) for a
further four years, since transaction data must be retained for ten years (see
paragraph 4.2 above).
5.3. Account information (see definition), is typically held in paper format or as a full
scan. Such information is to be retained for a period of six years from the date
when the account is closed. After six years, the bank may therefore destroy such
paper records or scanned images. In so doing, the bank would then be relying on
the corresponding account data (see definition) for a further four years, since
account data must be retained for ten years (see paragraph 4.3 above).
5.4. Obsolete collateral (security) items must be retained for a period of six years from
the date when the item was discharged.
5.5. Advances files must be retained for a period of six years, which shall start to run
from the date when the respective facility has been closed (unless legal
proceedings in respect of such repaid facilities are instituted during this period, in
which case the relative files should be retained beyond six years until the
conclusion of the legal proceedings).
Member banks, however, have no obligation to retain “old” advances files for more
than thirty years after they were archived, even though credit facilities to the
customer concerned have been ongoing.
This thirty year limit shall not apply to home loans, where the file must be retained
for a period of six years from date of closure. Thus a file for a forty year home loan
must be retained in its entirety for the full duration of the loan, plus a further six
years.
“Classified Debt” files are to be treated in the same way as other advances files. If
and when the debt is fully repaid, or a compromise is reached with the debtor
whereby a lesser amount is accepted by the bank in full and final settlement of the
debt, the file is to be retained for a period of six years from the date when the debt
has been fully repaid, or the agreed settlement amount has been received.
Otherwise, where the debt remains outstanding (irrespective of whether or not the
debt has been written down / off in the bank’s books), the file is to be retained for
at least thirty years after it was archived.

5.6. Fact finds / Know Your Customer (KYC) records or similar investment-related
reviews, portfolio management instructions, statements of compliance, etc. are to
be retained for six years. The six years shall start to run after the end of the
investment relationship.
Other documentation relating to the sale of investment to customers is to be
retained for a period of six years from the date when the sale was concluded. In the
case of documentation relating to life insurance products, such documentation is to
be retained for the lifetime of the insured customer from the date when the sale
was concluded and a period of six years thereafter.

5.7. The documentation which relates to all contracts, other than those mentioned
elsewhere in this section, is to be retained for a period of six years which shall start
to run from the date when such a contract is terminated or paid off or expired.
Examples under this category include safe deposit lockers, guarantees issued by the
bank, and letters of credit.

Executive summary

This Opinion complements the previous Article 29 Working Party (“WP29”) publications
Opinion 8/2001 on the processing of personal data in the employment context (WP48)1, and
the 2002 Working Document on the surveillance of electronic communications in the
workplace (WP55)2. Since the publication of these documents, a number of new
technologies have been adopted that enable more systematic processing of employees’
personal data at work, creating significant challenges to privacy and data protection.
This Opinion makes a new assessment of the balance between legitimate interests of
employers and the reasonable privacy expectations of employees by outlining the risks
posed by new technologies and undertaking a proportionality assessment of a number of
scenarios in which they could be deployed.
Whilst primarily concerned with the Data Protection Directive, the Opinion looks toward the
additional obligations placed on employers by the General Data Protection Regulation. It
also restates the position and conclusions of Opinion 8/2001 and the WP55 Working
Document, namely that when processing employees’ personal data:







employers should always bear in mind the fundamental data protection principles,
irrespective of the technology used;
the contents of electronic communications made from business premises enjoy the
same fundamental rights protections as analogue communications;
consent is highly unlikely to be a legal basis for data processing at work, unless
employees can refuse without adverse consequence;
performance of a contract and legitimate interests can sometimes be invoked,
provided the processing is strictly necessary for a legitimate purpose and complies
with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity;
employees should receive effective information about the monitoring that takes
place; and
any international transfer of employee data should take place only where an
adequate level of protection is ensured.

2.

Introduction

The rapid adoption of new information technologies in the workplace, in terms of
infrastructure, applications and smart devices, allows for new types of systematic and
potentially invasive data processing at work. For example:


technologies enabling data processing at work can now be implemented at a fraction
of the costs of several years ago whilst the capacity for the processing of personal data
by these technologies has increased exponentially;



new forms of processing, such as those concerning personal data on the use of
online services and/or location data from a smart device, are much less visible to
employees than other more traditional types such as overt CCTV cameras. This raises
questions about the extent to which employees are aware of these technologies, since
employers might unlawfully implement these processing without prior notice to the
employees; and

the boundaries between home and work have become increasingly blurred. For
example, when employees work remotely (e.g. from home), or whilst they are travelling
for business, monitoring of activities outside of the physical working environment can take
place and can potentially include monitoring of the individual in a private context.
Therefore, whilst the use of such technologies can be helpful in detecting or preventing the
loss of intellectual and material company property, improving the productivity of employees
and protecting the personal data for which the data controller is responsible, they also
create significant privacy and data protection challenges. As a result, a new assessment is
required concerning the balance between the legitimate interest of the employer to protect
its business and the reasonable expectation of privacy of the data subjects: the employees.
Whilst this Opinion will focus on new information technologies by assessing nine different
scenarios in which they can feature, it will also briefly reflect on more traditional methods of
data processing at work where the risks are amplified as a result of technological change.
Where the word “employee” is used in this Opinion, WP29 does not intend to restrict the
scope of this term merely to persons with an employment contract recognized as such
under applicable labour laws. Over the past decades, new business models served by
different types of labour relationships, and in particular employment on a freelance basis,
have become more commonplace. This Opinion is intended to cover all situations where
there is an employment relationship, regardless of whether this relationship is based on an
employment contract.
It is important to state that employees are seldom in a position to freely give, refuse or
revoke consent, given the dependency that results from the employer/employee
relationship. Unless in exceptional situations, employers will have to rely on another legal
ground than consent— such as the necessity to process the data for their legitimate
interest. However, a legitimate interest in itself is not sufficient to override the rights and
freedoms of employees.
Regardless of the legal basis for such processing, a proportionality test should be
undertaken prior to its commencement to consider whether the processing is necessary to
achieve a legitimate purpose, as well as the measures that have to be taken to ensure that
infringements of the rights to private life and secrecy of communications are limited to a
minimum. This can form part of a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

under Directive 95/46/EC (the Data Protection Directive or “DPD”)3 , this Opinion will also

look toward the obligations under Regulation 2016/679 (the General Data Protection
Regulation or “GDPR”)4, which has already entered into force and which will become
applicable on 25 May 2018.
With regard to the proposed ePrivacy Regulation5, the Working Party calls on European
legislators to create a specific exception for interference with devices issued to employees6.
The Proposed Regulation does not contain a suitable exception to the general interference
prohibition, and employers cannot usually provide valid consent for the processing of
personal data of their employees.
3.1

Directive 95/46/EC—Data Protection Directive (“DPD”)

In Opinion 08/2001, WP29 previously outlined that employers take into account the
fundamental data protection principles of the DPD when processing personal data in the
employment context. The development of new technologies and new methods of
processing in this context have not altered this situation—in fact, it can be said that such
developments have made it more important for employers to do so. In this context,
employers should:








ensure that data is processed for specified and legitimate purposes that are
proportionate and necessary;
take into account the principle of purpose limitation, while making sure that the
data are adequate, relevant and not excessive for the legitimate purpose;
apply the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity regardless of the applicable
legal ground;
be transparent with employees about the use and purposes of monitoring
technologies;
enable the exercise of data subject rights, including the rights of access and, as
appropriate, the rectification, erasure or blocking of personal data;
keep the data accurate, and not retain them any longer than necessary; and
take all necessary measures to protect the data against unauthorised access and
ensure that staff are sufficiently aware of data protection obligations.

Without repeating the earlier advice given, WP29 wishes to highlight three principles,
namely: legal grounds, transparency, and automated decisions.
3.1.1

LEGAL GROUNDS (ARTICLE 7)

When processing personal data in the employment context, at least one of the criteria set out in
Art. 7 has to be satisfied. If the types of personal data processed involve the special
categories(as elaborated in Art. 8), the processing is prohibited unless an exception applies 7,8.

As stated in part 8 of Opinion 08/2001; for example, Art. 8(2)(b) provides an exception for the purposes of carrying out
the obligations and specific rights of the controller in the field of employment law in so far as it is authorised by national
law providing for adequate safeguards.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

72

Even if the employer can rely on one of those exceptions, a legal ground from Art. 7 is still
required for the processing to be legitimate.
In summary, employers must therefore take note of the following:








for the majority of such data processing at work, the legal basis cannot and should
not be the consent of the employees (Art 7(a)) due to the nature of the relationship
between employer and employee;
processing may be necessary for the performance of a contract (Art 7(b)) in cases
where the employer has to process personal data of the employee to meet any such
obligations;
it is quite common that employment law may impose legal obligations (Art. 7(c))
that necessitate the processing of personal data; in such cases the employee must
be clearly and fully informed of such processing (unless an exception applies);
should an employer seek to rely on legitimate interest (Art. 7(f)) the purpose of the
processing must be legitimate; the chosen method or specific technology must be
necessary, proportionate and implemented in the least intrusive manner possible
along with the ability to enable the employer to demonstrate that appropriate
measures have been put in place to ensure a balance with the fundamental rights
and freedoms of employees9;
the processing operations must also comply with the transparency requirements
(Art. 10 and 11), and employees should be clearly and fully informed of the
processing of their personal data10, including the existence of any monitoring; and
appropriate technical and organisational measures should be adopted to ensure
security of the processing (Art. 17).

The most relevant criteria under Art. 7 are detailed below.


Consent (Article 7(a))

Consent, according to the DPD, is defined as any freely-given, specific and informed
indication of a data subject’s wishes by which the he or she signifies his or her agreement to
personal data relating to them being processed. For consent to be valid, it must also be
revocable.
WP29 has previously outlined in Opinion 8/2001 that where an employer has to process
personal data of his/her employees it is misleading to start with the supposition that the
processing can be legitimised through the employees’ consent. In cases where an employer
says they require consent and there is a real or potential relevant prejudice that arises from
the employee not consenting (which can be highly probable in the employment context,
especially when it concerns the employer tracking the behaviour of the employee over
time), then the consent is not valid since it is not and cannot be freely given. Thus, for the

8

It should be noted that in some countries, there are special measures in place that employers must abide by to protect
employees’ private lives. Portugal is one example of countries where such special measures exist and similar measures may
apply in some other Member States too. The conclusions in section 5.6 as well as the examples presented in sections 5.1
and 5.7.1 of this Opinion are therefore not valid in Portugal for these reasons.

WP 217, adopted 9 April 2014, url: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinionrecommendation/files/2014/wp217_en.pdf.
8 10 Pursuant to Art. 11(2) of the DPD, the controller is exempted from the obligation to provide information to the data
subject in cases where the recording or collection of data is expressly laid down by law.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

73

Malta Bankers’ Association

majority of the cases of employees’ data processing, the legal basis of that processing
cannot and should not be the consent of the employees, so a different legal basis is
required.
Moreover, even in cases where consent could be said to constitute a valid legal basis of such
a processing (i.e. if it can be undoubtedly concluded that the consent is freely given), it
needs to be a specific and informed indication of the employee’s wishes. Default settings on
devices and/or the installation of software that facilitate the electronic personal data
processing cannot qualify as consent given from employees, since consent requires an
active expression of will. A lack of action (i.e, not changing the default settings) may
generally not be considered as a specific consent to allow such processing11.


Performance of a contract (Article 7(b))

Employment relationships are often based on a contract of employment between the
employer and the employee. When meeting obligations under this contract, such as paying
the employee, the employer is required to process some personal data.


Legal obligations (Article 7(c))

It is quite common that employment law imposes legal obligations on the employer, which
necessitate the processing of personal data (e.g. for the purpose of tax calculation and
salary administration). Clearly, in such cases, such a law constitutes the legal basis for the
data processing..
Legitimate interest (Article 7(f))
If an employer wishes to rely upon the legal ground of Art. 7(f) of the DPD, the purpose of
the processing must be legitimate, and the chosen method or specific technology with
which the processing is to be undertaken must be necessary for the legitimate interest of
the employer. The processing must also be proportionate to the business needs, i.e. the
purpose, it is meant to address. Data processing at work should be carried out in the least
intrusive manner possible and be targeted to the specific area of risk. Additionally, if relying
on Art. 7(f), the employee retains the right to object to the processing on compelling
legitimate grounds under Art. 14.
In order to rely on Art. 7(f) as the legal ground for processing it is essential that specific
mitigating measures are present to ensure a proper balance between the legitimate interest
of the employer and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the employees.12 Such
measures, depending on the form of monitoring, should include limitations on monitoring
so as to guarantee that the employee’s privacy is not violated. Such limitations could be:

For an example of the balance that needs to be struck, see the case of Köpke v Germany, [2010] ECHR 1725,
(URL: http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/1725.html), in which an employee was dismissed as a result
of a covert video surveillance operation undertaken by the employer and a private detective agency. Whilst in
this instance the Court concluded that the domestic authorities had struck a fair balance between the
employer’s legitimate interest (in the protection of its property rights), the employee’s right to respect for
private life, and the public interest in the administration of justice, it also observed that the various interests
concerned could be given a different weight in future as a result of technological development

geographical (e.g. monitoring only in specific places; monitoring sensitive areas
such as religious places and for example sanitary zones and break rooms should
be prohibited),
data-oriented (e.g. personal electronic files and communication should not be
monitored), and
time-related (e.g. sampling instead of continuous monitoring).
TRANSPARENCY (ARTICLES 10 AND 11)

The transparency requirements of Articles 10 and 11 apply to data processing at work;
employees must be informed of the existence of any monitoring, the purposes for which
personal data are to be processed and any other information necessary to guarantee fair
processing.
With new technologies, the need for transparency becomes more evident since they enable
the collection and further processing of possibly huge amounts of personal data in a covert
way.
3.1.3

AUTOMATED DECISIONS (ARTICLE 15)

Art. 15 of the DPD also grants data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based
solely on automated processing, where that decision produces legal effects or similarly
significantly affects them and which is based solely on automated processing of data
intended to evaluate certain personal aspects, such as performance at work, unless the
decision is necessary for entering into or performance of a contract, authorised by Union or
Member State law, or is based on the explicit consent of the data subject.
3.2

Regulation 2016/679—General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)

The GDPR includes and enhances the requirements in the DPD. It also introduces new
obligations for all data controllers, including employers.
3.2.1

DATA PROTECTION BY DESIGN

Art. 25 of the GDPR requires data controllers to implement data protection by design and by
default. As an example: where an employer issues devices to employees, the most privacyfriendly solutions should be selected if tracking technologies are involved. Data
minimisation must also be taken into account.
3.2.2

DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

Art. 35 of the GDPR outlines the requirements for a data controller to carry out a Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) where a type of processing, in particular using new
technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
processing itself, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons. An example is a case of systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects
related to natural persons based on automated processing including profiling, and on which
decisions are taken that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly
significantly affect the natural person.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

75

Malta Bankers’ Association

Where the DPIA indicates that the identified risks cannot be sufficiently addressed by the
controller—i.e., that the residual risks remain high—then the controller must consult the
supervisory authority prior to the commencement of the processing (Art. 36(1)) as clarified
in the WP29 guidelines on DPIAs13.
3.2.2

“PROCESSING IN THE CONTEXT OF EMPLOYMENT”

Art. 88 of the GDPR states that Member States may, by law or collective agreements,
provide for more specific rules to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in
respect of the processing of employees’ personal data in the employment context. In
particular, these rules may be provided for the purposes of:









recruitment;
performance of the employment contract (including discharge of obligations laid
down by law or collective agreements);
management, planning and organisation of work;
equality and diversity in the workplace;
health and safety at work;
protection of an employer’s or customer’s property;
exercise and enjoyment (on an individual basis) of rights and benefits related to
employment; and
termination of the employment relationship.

In accordance with Art. 88(2), any such rules should include suitable and specific measures
to safeguard the data subject’s human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights,
with particular regard to:




the transparency of processing;
the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings or group of enterprises
engaged in a joint economic activity; and
monitoring systems at the workplace.

In this Opinion, the Working Party has provided guidelines for the legitimate use of new
technology in a number of specific situations, detailing suitable and specific measures to
safeguard the human dignity, legitimate interest and fundamental rights of employees.

4.

Risks

Modern technologies enable employees to be tracked over time, across workplaces and
their homes, through many different devices such as smartphones, desktops, tablets,
vehicles and wearables. If there are no limits to the processing, and if it is not transparent,
there is a high risk that the legitimate interest of employers in the improvement of
efficiency and the protection of company assets turns into unjustifiable and intrusive
monitoring.
Technologies that monitor communications can also have a chilling effect on the
fundamental rights of employees to organise, set up workers’ meetings, and to

communications and behaviour will put pressure on employees to conform in order to
prevent the detection of what might be perceived as anomalies, in a comparable way to the
way in which the intensive use of CCTV has influenced citizens’ behaviour in public spaces.
Moreover, owing to the capabilities of such technologies, employees may not be aware of
what personal data are being processed and for which purposes, whilst it is also possible
that they are not even aware of the existence of the monitoring technology itself.
Monitoring IT usage also differs from other, more visible observation and monitoring tools
like CCTV in that it can take place in a covert way. In the absence of an easily
understandable and readily accessible workplace monitoring policy, employees may not be
aware of the existence and consequences of the monitoring that is taking place, and are
therefore unable to exercise their rights. A further risk comes from the “over-collection” of
data in such systems, e.g. those collecting WiFi location data.
The increase in the amount of data generated in the workplace environment, in
combination with new techniques for data analysis and cross-matching, may also create
risks of incompatible further processing. Examples of illegitimate further processing include
using systems that are legitimately installed to protect properties to then monitor the
availability, performance and customer-friendliness of employees. Others include using data
collected via a CCTV system to regularly monitor the behaviour and performance of
employees, or using data of a geolocation system (such as for example WiFi- or Bluetooth
tracking) to constantly check an employee’s movements and behaviour.
As a result, such tracking may infringe upon the privacy rights of employees, regardless of
whether the monitoring takes place systematically or occasionally. The risk is not limited to
the analysis of the content of communications. Thus, the analysis of metadata about a
person might allow for an equally privacy-invasive detailed monitoring of an individual’s life
and behavioural patterns.
The extensive use of monitoring technologies may also limit employees’ willingness to (and
channels by which they could) inform employers about irregularities or illegal actions of
superiors and/or other employees threatening to damage the business (especially client
data) or workplace. Anonymity is often necessary for a concerned employee to take action
and report such situations. Monitoring that infringes upon the privacy rights of employees
may hamper necessary communications to the appropriate officers. In such an instance, the
established means for internal whistle-blowers may become ineffective1414.

Scenarios

This section addresses a number of data processing at work scenarios in which new
technologies and/or developments of existing technologies have, or may have, the potential
to result in high risks to the privacy of employees. In all such cases employers should
consider whether:

the processing activity is necessary, and if so, the legal grounds that apply;
the proposed processing of personal data is fair to the employees;
the processing activity is proportionate to the concerns raised; and
the processing activity is transparent.
5.1

Processing operations during the recruitment process

Use of social media by individuals is widespread and it is relatively common for user profiles
to be publicly viewable depending on the settings chosen by the account holder. As a result,
employers may believe that inspecting the social profiles of prospective candidates can be
justified during their recruitment processes. This may also be the case for other publiclyavailable information about the potential employee.
However, employers should not assume that merely because an individual’s social media
profile is publicly available they are then allowed to process those data for their own
purposes. A legal ground is required for this processing, such as legitimate interest. In this
context the employer should—prior to the inspection of a social media profile—take into
account whether the social media profile of the applicant is related to business or private
purposes, as this can be an important indication for the legal admissibility of the data
inspection. In addition, employers are only allowed to collect and process personal data
relating to job applicants to the extent that the collection of those data is necessary and
relevant to the performance of the job which is being applied for.
Data collected during the recruitment process should generally be deleted as soon as it
becomes clear that an offer of employment will not be made or is not accepted by the
individual concerned15. The individual must also be correctly informed of any such
processing before they engage with the recruitment process.
There is no legal ground for an employer to require potential employees to “friend” the
potential employer, or in other ways provide access to the contents of their profiles.
Example
During the recruitment of new staff, an employer checks the profiles of the candidates on
various social networks and includes information from these networks (and any other
information available on the internet) in the screening process.
Only if it is necessary for the job to review information about a candidate on social media,
for example in order to be able to assess specific risks regarding candidates for a specific
function, and the candidates are correctly informed (for example, in the text of the job
advert) the employer may have a legal basis under Article 7(f) to review publicly-available
information about candidates.

https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805c3f7a). In cases where the
employer wishes to retain the data with a view to a further job opportunity, the data subject should be
informed accordingly and be given the possibility to object to such further processing, in which case it should
be deleted (Id.).

5.2

Processing operations resulting from in-employment screening

Through the existence of profiles on social media, and the development of new analytical
technologies, employers have (or can obtain) the technical capability of permanently
screening employees by collecting information regarding their friends, opinions, beliefs,
interests, habits, whereabouts, attitudes and behaviours therefore capturing data, including
sensitive data, relating to the employee's private and family life.
In-employment screening of employees’ social media profiles should not take place on a
generalised basis.
Moreover, employers should refrain from requiring an employee or a job applicant access
to information that he or she shares with others through social networking.
Example
An employer monitors the LinkedIn profiles of former employees that are involved during
the duration of non-compete clauses. The purpose of this monitoring is to monitor
compliance with such clauses. The monitoring is limited to these former employees.
As long as the employer can prove that such monitoring is necessary to protect his
legitimate interests, that there are no other, less invasive means available, and that the
former employees have been adequately informed about the extent of the regular
observation of their public communications, the employer may be able to rely on the legal
basis of Article 7(f) of the DPD.
Additionally, employees should not be required to utilise a social media profile that is
provided by their employer. Even when this is specifically foreseen in light of their tasks
(e.g. spokesperson for an organisation), they must retain the option of a “non-work” nonpublic profile that they can use instead of the “official” employer-related profile, and this
should be specified in the terms and conditions of the employment contract.
5.3

Processing operations resulting from monitoring ICT usage at the workplace

Traditionally, the monitoring of electronic communications in the workplace (eg, phone,
internet browsing, email, instant messaging, VOIP, etc.) was considered the main threat to
employees’ privacy. In its 2001 Working Document on the surveillance of electronic
communications in the workplace, WP29 made a number of conclusions in relation to the
monitoring of email and internet usage. While those conclusions remain valid, there is a
need to take into account technological developments that have enabled newer, potentially
more intrusive and pervasive ways of monitoring. Such developments include, amongst
others:



Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools, which monitor outgoing communications for the
purpose of detecting potential data breaches;
Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) and Unified Threat Management (UTM)
systems, which can provide a variety of monitoring technologies including deep
packet inspection, TLS interception, website filtering, content filtering, on-appliance
reporting, user identity information and (as described above) data loss prevention.
Such technologies may also be deployed individually, depending on the employer;

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks









security applications and measures that involve logging employee access to the
employer’s systems;
eDiscovery technology, which refers to any process in which electronic data is
searched with the aim of its use as evidence;
tracking of application and device usage via unseen software, either on the desktop
or in the cloud;
the use in the workplace of office applications provided as a cloud service, which in
theory allow for very detailed logging of the activities of employees;
monitoring of personal devices (e.g., PCs, mobile phones, tablets), that employees
supply for their work in accordance with a specific use policy, such as Bring-YourOwn-Device (BYOD), as well as Mobile Device Management (MDM) technology
which enables the distribution of applications, data and configuration settings, and
patches for mobile devices; and
the use of wearable devices (e.g., health and fitness devices).

It is possible that an employer will implement an “all-in-one” monitoring solution, such as a
suite of security packages which enable them to monitor all ICT usage in the workplace as
opposed to just email and/or website monitoring as was once the case. The conclusions
adopted in WP55 would apply for any system that enables such monitoring to take place.16
Example
An employer intends to deploy a TLS inspection appliance to decrypt and inspect secure
traffic, with the purpose of detecting anything malicious. The appliance is also able to record
and analyse the entirety of an employee’s online activity on the organisation’s network.
Use of encrypted communications protocols is increasingly being implemented to protect
online data flows involving personal data against interception. However, this can also
present issues, as the encryption makes it impossible to monitor incoming and outgoing
data. TLS inspection equipment decrypts the data stream, analyses the content for security
purposes and then re-encrypts the stream afterwards.
In this example, the employer relies upon legitimate interests—the necessity to protect the
network, and the personal data of employees and customers held within that network,
against unauthorised access or data leakage. However, monitoring every online activity of
the employees is a disproportionate response and an interference with the right to secrecy
of communications. The employer should first investigate other, less invasive, means to
protect the confidentiality of customer data and the security of the network.
To the extent that some interception of TLS traffic can be qualified as strictly necessary, the
appliance should be configured in a way to prevent permanent logging of employee activity,
for example by blocking suspicious incoming or outgoing traffic and redirecting the user to
an information portal where he or she may ask for review of such an automated decision. If
some general logging would nonetheless be deemed strictly necessary, the appliance may

http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/253.html), in which the Court stated that emails sent from
business premises and information derived from the monitoring of internet use could be a part of an
employee’s private life and correspondence, and that the collection and storage of that information without
the knowledge of the employee would amount to an interference with the employee’s rights, although the
Court did not rule that such monitoring would never be necessary in a democratic society.
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

80

also be configured not to store log data unless the appliance signals the occurrence of an
incident, with a minimization of the information collected.
As a good practice, the employer could offer alternative unmonitored access for employees.
This could be done by offering free WiFi, or stand-alone devices or terminals (with
appropriate safeguards to ensure confidentiality of the communications) where employees
can exercise their legitimate right to use work facilities for some private usage17. Moreover,
employers should consider certain types of traffic whose interception endangers the proper
balance between their legitimate interests and employee’s privacy—such as the use of
private webmail, visits to online banking and health websites—with the aim to appropriately
configure the appliance so as not to proceed with interception of communications in
circumstances that are not compliant with proportionality. Information on the type of
communications that the appliance is monitoring should be specified to the employees.
A policy concerning the purposes for when, and by whom, suspicious log data can be
accessed should be developed and made easily and permanently accessible for all
employees, in order to also guide them about acceptable and unacceptable use of the
network and facilities. This allows employees to adapt their behaviour to prevent being
monitored when they legitimately use IT work facilities for private use. As good practice,
such a policy should be evaluated, at least annually, to assess whether the chosen
monitoring solution delivers the intended results, and whether there are other, less invasive
tools or means available to achieve the same purposes.
Irrespective of the technology concerned or the capabilities it possesses, the legal basis of
Article 7(f) is only available if the processing meets certain conditions. Firstly, employers
utilising these products and applications must consider the proportionality of the measures
they are implementing, and whether any additional actions can be taken to mitigate or
reduce the scale and impact of the data processing. As an example of good practice, this
consideration could be undertaken via a DPIA prior to the introduction of any monitoring
technology. Secondly, employers must implement and communicate acceptable use policies
alongside privacy policies, outlining the permissible use of the organisation’s network and
equipment, and strictly detailing the processing taking place.
In some countries the creation of such a policy would legally require approval of a Workers’
Council or similar representation of employees. In practice, such policies are often drafted
by IT maintenance staff. Since their main focus will mostly be on security, and not on the
legitimate expectation of privacy of employees, WP29 recommends that in all cases a
representative sample of employees is involved in assessing the necessity of the monitoring,
as well as the logic and accessibility of the policy.

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

81

Malta Bankers’ Association

Example
An employer deploys a Data Loss Prevention tool to monitor the outgoing e-mails
automatically, for the purpose of preventing unauthorised transmission of proprietary data
(e.g. customer’s personal data), independently from whether such an action is unintentional
or not. Once an e-mail is being considered as the potential source of a data breach, further
investigation is performed.
Again, the employer relies upon the necessity for his legitimate interest to protect the
personal data of customers as well as his assets against unauthorised access or data
leakage. However, such a DLP tool may involve unnecessary processing of personal data —
for example, a “false positive” alert might result in unauthorized access of legitimate e-mails
that have been sent by employees (which may be, for instance, personal e-mails).
Therefore, the necessity of the DLP tool and its deployment should be fully justified so as to
strike the proper balance between his legitimate interests and the fundamental right to the
protection of employees’ personal data. In order for the legitimate interests of the employer
to be relied upon, certain measures should be taken to mitigate the risks. For example, the
rules that the system follows to characterize an e-mail as potential data breach should be
fully transparent to the users, and in cases that the tool recognises an e-mail that is to be
sent as a possible data breach, a warning message should inform the sender of the e-mail
prior to the e-mail transmission, so as to give the sender the option to cancel this
transmission.
In some cases, the monitoring of employees is possible not so much because of the
deployment of specific technologies, but simply because employees are expected to use
online applications made available by the employer which process personal data. The use of
cloud-based office applications (e.g. document editors, calendars, social networking) is an
example of this. It should be ensured that employees can designate certain private spaces to
which the employer may not gain access unless under exceptional circumstances. This, for
example, is relevant for calendars, which are often also used for private appointments. If the
employee sets an appointment to “Private” or notes this in appointment itself, employers
(and other employees) should not be allowed to review the contents of the appointment.
The requirement of subsidiarity in this context sometimes means that no monitoring may
take place at all. For example, this is the case where the prohibited use of communications
services can be prevented by blocking certain websites. If it is possible to block websites,
instead of continuously monitoring all communications, blocking should be chosen in order
to comply with this requirement of subsidiarity.
More generally, prevention should be given much more weight than detection—the
interests of the employer are better served by preventing internet misuse through technical
means than by expending resources in detecting misuse.
5.4

Processing operations resulting from monitoring ICT usage outside the
workplace
ICT usage outside the workplace has become more common with the growth of
homeworking, remote working and “bring your own device” policies. The capabilities of
such technologies can pose a risk to the private life of employees, as in many cases the
monitoring systems existing in the workplace are effectively extended into the employees’
domestic sphere when they use such equipment. .
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

82

Malta Bankers’ Association

5.4.1

MONITORING OF HOME AND REMOTE WORKING

It has become more common for employers to offer employees the option to work
remotely, e.g., from home and/or whilst in transit. Indeed, this is a central factor behind the
reduced distinction between the workplace and the home. In general this involves the
employer issuing ICT equipment or software to the employees which, once installed in their
home/on their own devices, enables them to have the same level of access to the
employer’s network, systems and resources that they would have if they were in the
workplace, depending on the implementation.
Whilst remote working can be a positive development, it also presents an area of additional
risk for an employer. For example, employees that have remote access to the employer’s
infrastructure are not bound by the physical security measures that may be in place at the
employer’s premises. To put it plainly: without the implementation of appropriate technical
measures the risk of unauthorised access increases and may result in the loss or destruction
of information, including personal data of employees or customers, which the employer may
hold.
In order to mitigate this area of risk employers may think there is a justification for
deploying software packages (either on-premise or in the cloud) that have the capabilities
of, for example, logging keystrokes and mouse movements, screen capturing (either
randomly or at set intervals), logging of applications used (and how long they were used
for), and, upon compatible devices, enabling webcams and collecting the footage thereof.
Such technologies are widely available including from third parties such as cloud providers.
However, the processing involved in such technologies are disproportionate and the
employer is very unlikely to have a legal ground under legitimate interest, e.g. for recording
an employee’s keystrokes and mouse movements.
The key is addressing the risk posed by home and remote working in a proportionate, nonexcessive manner, in whatever way the option is offered and by whatever technology is
proposed, particularly if the boundaries between business and private use are fluid.
5.4.2

BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE (BYOD)

Due to the rise in popularity, features and capability of consumer electronic devices,
employers may face demands from employees to use their own devices in the workplace to
carry out their jobs. This is known as “bring your own device” or BYOD.
Implementing BYOD effectively can lead to a number of benefits for employees, including
improved employee job satisfaction, overall morale increase, increased job efficiency and
increased flexibility. However, by definition, some use of an employee's device will be
personal in nature, and this is more likely to be the case at certain times of the day (e.g.,
evenings and weekends). It is therefore a distinct possibility that employees’ use of their
own devices will lead to employers processing non-corporate information about those
employees, and possibly any family members who also use the devices in question.
In the employment context, BYOD privacy risks are commonly associated with monitoring
technologies that collect identifiers such as MAC addresses, or in instances where an
employer accesses an employee’s device under the justification of performing a security
scan, i.e. for malware. In respect of the latter, a number of commercial solutions exist that
allow for the scanning of private devices, however their usage could potentially
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

83

Malta Bankers’ Association

access all data on that device and therefore they must be carefully managed. For example,
those sections of a device which are presumed to be only used for private purposes (e.g. the
folder storing photos taken with the device) may in principle not be accessed.
Monitoring the location and traffic of such devices may be considered to serve a legitimate
interest to protect the personal data that the employer is responsible for as the data
controller; however this may be unlawful where an employee's personal device is
concerned, if such monitoring also captures data relating to the employee's private and
family life. In order to prevent monitoring of private information appropriate measures must
be in place to distinguish between private and business use of the device.
Employers should also implement methods by which their own data on the device is
securely transferred between that device and their network. It may be the case that the
device is therefore configured to route all traffic through a VPN back into the corporate
network, so as to offer a certain level of security; however, if such a measure is used, the
employer should also consider that software installed for the purposes of monitoring pose a
privacy risk during periods of personal usage by the employee. Devices that offer additional
protections such as “sandboxing” data (keeping data contained within a specific app) could
be used.
Conversely, the employer must also consider the prohibition of the use of specific work
devices for private use if there is no way to prevent private use being monitored—for
example if the device offers remote access to personal data for which the employer is the
data controller.
5.4.3

MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT (MDM)

Mobile device management enables employers to locate devices remotely, deploy specific
configurations and/or applications, and delete data on demand. An employer may operate
this functionality himself, or use a third party to do so. MDM services also enable employers
to record or track the device in real-time even if it is not reported stolen.
A DPIA should be performed prior to the deployment of any such technology where it is
new, or new to the data controller. If the outcome of the DPIA is that the MDM technology
is necessary in specific circumstances, an assessment should still be made as to whether the
resulting data processing complies with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.
Employers must ensure that the data collected as part of this remote location capability is
processed for a specified purpose and does not, and could not, form part of a wider
programme enabling ongoing monitoring of employees. Even for specified purposes, the
tracking features should be mitigated. Tracking systems can be designed to register the
location data without presenting it to the employer—in such circumstances, the location
data should become available only in circumstances where the device would be reported or
lost.
Employees whose devices are enrolled in MDM services must also be fully informed as to
what tracking is taking place, and what consequences this has for them.
5.4.4

WEARABLE DEVICES

Employers are increasingly tempted to provide wearable devices to their employees in order
to track and monitor their health and activity within and sometimes even outside of the
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

84

Malta Bankers’ Association

workplace. However, this data processing involves the processing of health data, and is
therefore prohibited based on Article 8 of the DPD.
Given the unequal relationship between employers and employees—i.e., the employee has
a financial dependence on the employer—and the sensitive nature of the health data, it is
highly unlikely that legally valid explicit consent can be given for the tracking or monitoring
of such data as employees are essentially not 'free' to give such consent in the first place.
Even if the employer uses a third party to collect the health data, which would only provide
aggregated information about general health developments to the employer, the processing
would still be unlawful.
Also, as described in Opinion 5/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques18, it is technically very
difficult to ensure complete anonymisation of the data. Even in an environment with over a
thousand employees, given the availability of other data about the employees the employer
would still be able to single out individual employees with particular health indications such
as high blood pressure or obesity.
Example:
An organisation offers fitness monitoring devices to its employees as a general gift. The
devices count the number of steps employees take, and register their heartbeats and
sleeping patterns over time.
The resulting health data should only be accessible to the employee and not the employer.
Any data transferred between the employee (as data subject) and the device/service
provider (as data controller) is a matter for those parties.
As the health data could also be processed by the commercial party that has manufactured
the devices or offers a service to employers, when choosing the device or service the
employer should evaluate the privacy policy of the manufacturer and/or service provider, to
ensure that it does not result in unlawful processing of health data on employees.
5.5

Processing operations relating to time and attendance

Systems that enable employers to control who can enter their premises, and/or certain
areas within their premises, can also allow the tracking of employees’ activities. Although
such systems have existed for a number of years, new technologies intended to track
employees’ time and attendance are being more widely deployed, including those that
process of biometric data as well as others such as mobile device tracking.
Whilst such systems can form an important component of an employer’s audit trail, they
also pose the risk of providing an invasive level of knowledge and control regarding the
activities of the employee whilst in the workplace.

Malta Bankers’ Association

Example:
An employer maintains a server room in which business-sensitive data, personal data
relating to employees and personal data relating to customers is stored in digital form. In
order to comply with legal obligations to secure the data against unauthorised access, the
employer has installed an access control system that records the entrance and exit of
employees who have appropriate permission to enter the room. Should any item of
equipment go missing, or if any data is subject to unauthorised access, loss or theft, the
records maintained by the employer allow them to determine who had access to the room
at that time.
Given that the processing is necessary and does not outweigh the right to private life of the
employees, it can be in the legitimate interest under Art. 7(f), if the employees have been
adequately informed about the processing operation. However, the continuous monitoring
of the frequency and exact entrance and exit times of the employees cannot be justified if
these data are also used for another purpose, such as employee performance evaluation.
5.6

Processing operations using video monitoring systems

Video monitoring and surveillance continues to present similar issues for employee privacy
as before: the capability to continuously capture the behaviour of the worker. 19 The most
relevant changes relating to the application of this technology in the employment context
are the capability to access the collected data remotely (e.g. via a smartphone) easily; the
reduction in the cameras’ sizes (along with an increase in their capabilities, e.g. highdefinition); and the processing that can be performed by new video analytics.
With the capabilities given by video analytics, it is possible for an employer to monitor the
worker’s facial expressions by automated means, to identify deviations from predefined
movement patterns (e.g. factory context), and more. This would be disproportionate to the
rights and freedoms of employees, and therefore, generally unlawful. The processing is also
likely to involve profiling, and possibly, automated decision-making. Therefore, employers
should refrain from the use of facial recognition technologies. There may be some fringe
exceptions to this rule, but such scenarios cannot be used to invoke a general legitimation
of the use of such technology20.
5.7

Processing operations involving vehicles used by employees

Technologies that enable employers to monitor their vehicles have become widely adopted,
particularly among organisations whose activities involve transport or have significant
vehicle fleets.
Any employer using vehicle telematics will be collecting data about both the vehicle and the
individual employee using that vehicle. This data can include not just the location of the
vehicle (and, hence, the employee) collected by basic GPS tracking systems, but, depending
on the technology, a wealth of other information including driving behaviour. Certain

19

See the above referenced case of Köpke v Germany; additionally, it should also be noted that in some
jurisdictions the installation of systems such as CCTV for the purpose of proving unlawful conduct has been
ruled permissible; see the case of Bershka in the Constitutional Court of Spain.
20
Moreover, under the GDPR, processing of biometric data for identification purposes must be based on an
exception provided by Art. 9(2).
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

86

Malta Bankers’ Association

technologies can also enable continuous monitoring both of the vehicle and the driver (eg,
event data recorders).
An employer might be obliged to install tracking technology in vehicles to demonstrate
compliance with other legal obligations, e.g. to ensure the safety of employees who drive
those vehicles. The employer may also have a legitimate interest in being able to locate the
vehicles at any time. Even if employers would have a legitimate interest to achieve these
purposes, it should first be assessed whether the processing for these purposes is necessary,
and whether the actual implementation complies with the principles of proportionality and
subsidiarity. Where private use of a professional vehicle is allowed, the most important
measure an employer can take to ensure compliance with these principles is the offering of
an opt-out: the employee in principle should have the option to temporarily turn off
location tracking when special circumstances justify this turning off, such as a visit to a
doctor. This way, the employee can on its own initiative protect certain location data as
private. The employer must ensure that the collected data are not used for illegitimate
further processing, such as the tracking and evaluation of employees.
The employer must also clearly inform the employees that a tracking device has been
installed in a company vehicle that they are driving, and that their movements are being
recorded whilst they are using that vehicle (and that, depending on the technology involved,
their driving behaviour may also be recorded). Preferably such information should be
displayed prominently in every car, within eyesight of the driver.
It is possible that employees may use company vehicles outside working hours, e.g. for
personal use, depending on the specific policies governing the use of those vehicles. Given
the sensitivity of location data, it is unlikely that there is a legal basis for monitoring the
locations of employees’ vehicles outside agreed working hours. However, should such a
necessity exist, an implementation that would be proportionate to the risks should be
considered. For example, this could mean that, in order to prevent car theft, the location of
the car is not registered outside working hours, unless the vehicle leaves a widely defined
circle (region or even country). In addition, the location would only be shown in a “breakthe-glass” way—the employer would only activate the “visibility” of the location, accessing
the data already stored by the system, when the vehicle leaves a predefined region.
As stated in the WP29 Opinion 13/2011 on Geolocation services on smart mobile devices21:
“Vehicle tracking devices are not staff tracking devices. Their function is to track or monitor
the location of the vehicles in which they are installed. Employers should not regard them as
devices to track or monitor the behaviour or the whereabouts of drivers or other staff, for
example by sending alerts in relation to speed of vehicle.”
Further, as stated in the WP29 Opinion 5/2005 on the use of location data with a view to
providing value-added services22:

“Processing location data can be justified where it is done as part of monitoring the
transport of people or goods or improving the distribution of resources for services in
scattered locations (e.g. planning operations in real time), or where a security objective is
being pursued in relation to the employee himself or to the goods or vehicles in his charge.
Conversely, the Working Party considers data processing to be excessive where employees
are free to organise their travel arrangements as they wish or where it is done for the sole
purpose of monitoring an employee's work where this can be monitored by other means.”

5.7.1

EVENT DATA RECORDERS

Event data recorders provide an employer with the technical capability of processing a
significant amount of personal data about the employees that drive company vehicles. Such
devices are increasingly being placed into vehicles with the goal to record video, possibly
including sound, in case of an accident. These systems are able to record at certain times,
e.g. in response to sudden braking, abrupt directional change or accidents, where the
moments immediately preceding the incident are stored, but they can also be set to monitor
continuously. This information can be used subsequently to observe and review an
individual’s driving behaviour with the aim of improving it. Moreover, many of these
systems include GPS to track the location of the vehicle in real-time and other details
corresponding to the driving (such as the vehicle speed) can be also stored for further
processing.
These devices have become particularly prevalent among organisations whose activities
involve transport or have significant vehicle fleets. However, the deployment of event data
recorders can only be lawful if there is a necessity to process the ensuing personal data
about the employee for a legitimate purpose, and the processing complies with the
principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.
Example
A transport company equips all of its vehicles with a video camera inside the cabin which
records sound and video. The purpose of processing these data is to improve the driving
skills of the employees. The cameras are configured to retain recordings whenever incidents
such as sudden braking or abrupt directional change take place. The company assumes it
has a legal ground for the processing in its legitimate interest under Article 7(f) of the
Directive, to protect the safety of its employees and other drivers’ safety.
However, the legitimate interest of the company to monitor the drivers does not prevail
over the rights of those drivers to the protection of their personal data. The continuous
monitoring of employees with such cameras constitutes a serious interference with their
right of privacy. There are other methods (e.g., the installation of equipment that prevents
the use of mobile phones) as well as other safety systems like an advanced emergency
braking system or a lane departure warning system that can be used for the prevention of
vehicle accidents which may be more appropriate. Furthermore, such a video has a high
probability of resulting in the processing of personal data of third parties (such as
pedestrians) and, for such a processing, the legitimate interest of the company is not
sufficient to justify the processing.

Processing operations involving disclosure of employee data to third parties

It has become increasingly common for companies to transmit their employees’ data to
their customers for the purpose of ensuring reliable service provision. These data may be
quite excessive depending on the scope of services provided (e.g. an employee’s photo may
be included). However, employees are not in a position, given the imbalance of power, to
give free consent to the processing of their personal data by their employer, and if the data
processing is not proportional, the employer does not have a legal ground.
Example:
A delivery company sends its customers an e-mail with a link to the name and the location
of the deliverer (employee). The company also intended to provide a passport photo of the
deliverer. The company assumed it would have a legal ground for the processing in its
legitimate interest (Article 7(f) of the Directive), allowing the customer to check if the
deliverer is indeed the right person.
However, it is not necessary to provide the name and the photo of the deliverer to the
customers. Since there is no other legitimate ground for this processing, the delivery
company is not allowed to provide these personal data to customers.
5.9

Processing operations involving international transfers of HR and other
employee data

Employers are increasingly using cloud-based applications and services, such as those
designed for the handling of HR-data as well as online office applications. The use of most of
these applications will result in the international transfer of data from and concerning
employees. As previously outlined in Opinion 08/2001, Art. 25 of the Directive states that
transfers of personal data to a third country outside the EU can take place only where that
country ensures an adequate level of protection. Whatever the basis, the transfer should
satisfy the provisions of the Directive.
It should thus be ensured that these provisions concerning the international transfer of data
are complied with. WP29 re-states its previous position that it is preferable to rely on
adequate protection rather than the derogations listed in Art. 26 of the DPD; where consent
is relied on it must be specific, unambiguous and freely-given. However, it should also be
ensured that the data shared outside the EU/EEA, and subsequent access by other entities
within the group, remains limited to the minimum necessary for the intended purposes.

Conclusions and Recommendations

6.1

Fundamental rights

The contents of communications above, as well as the traffic data relating to those
communications, enjoy the same fundamental rights protections as “analogue”
communications.
Electronic communications made from business premises may be covered by the notions of
“private life” and “correspondence” within the meaning of Article 8 paragraph 1 of the
European Convention. Based on the current Data Protection Directive employers may only
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

89

Malta Bankers’ Association

collect the data for legitimate purposes, with the processing taking place under appropriate
conditions (e.g., proportionate and necessary, for a real and present interest, in a lawful,
articulated and transparent manner), with a legal basis for the processing of personal data
collected from or generated through electronic communications.
The fact that an employer has the ownership of the electronic means does not rule out the
right of employees to secrecy of their communications, related location data and
correspondence. The tracking of the location of employees through their self-owned or
company issued devices should be limited to where it is strictly necessary for a legitimate
purpose. Certainly, in the case of Bring Your Own Device it is important that employees are
given the opportunity to shield their private communications from any work-related
monitoring.
6.2

Consent; legitimate interest

Employees are almost never in a position to freely give, refuse or revoke consent, given the
dependency that results from the employer/employee relationship. Given the imbalance of
power, employees can only give free consent in exceptional circumstances, when no
consequences at all are connected to acceptance or rejection of an offer.
The legitimate interest of employers can sometimes be invoked as a legal ground, but only if
the processing is strictly necessary for a legitimate purpose and the processing complies
with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity. A proportionality test should be
conducted prior to the deployment of any monitoring tool to consider whether all data are
necessary, whether this processing outweighs the general privacy rights that employees also
have in the workplace and what measures must be taken to ensure that infringements on
the right to private life and the right to secrecy of communications are limited to the
minimum necessary.
6.3

Transparency

Effective communication should be provided to employees concerning any monitoring that
takes place, the purposes for this monitoring and the circumstances, as well as possibilities
for employees to prevent their data being captured by monitoring technologies. Policies and
rules concerning legitimate monitoring must be clear and readily accessible. The Working
Party recommends involving a representative sample of employees in the creation and
evaluation of such rules and policies as most monitoring has the potential to infringe on the
private lives of employees.
6.4

Proportionality and data minimisation

Data processing at work must be a proportionate response to the risks faced by an
employer. For example, internet misuse can be detected without the necessity of analysing
website content. If misuse can be prevented (e.g., by using web filters) the employer has no
general right to monitor.
Further, a blanket ban on communication for personal reasons is impractical and
enforcement may require a level of monitoring that may be disproportionate. Prevention
should be given much more weight than detection--the interests of the employer are better

Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

served by preventing internet misuse through technical means than by expending resources
in detecting misuse.
The information registered from the ongoing monitoring, as well as the information that is
shown to the employer, should be minimized as much as possible. Employees should have
the possibility to temporarily shut off location tracking, if justified by the circumstances.
Solutions that for example track vehicles can be designed to register the position data
without presenting it to the employer.
Employers must take the principle of data minimisation into account when deciding on the
deployment of new technologies. The information should be stored for the minimum
amount of time needed with a retention period specified. Whenever information is no
longer needed it should be deleted.
6.5

Cloud services, online applications and international transfers

Where employees are expected to use online applications which process personal data
(such as online office applications), employers should consider enabling employees to
designate certain private spaces to which the employer may not gain access under any
circumstances, such as a private mail or document folder.
The use of most applications in the cloud will result in the international transfer of employee
data. It should be ensured that personal data transferred to a third country outside the EU
takes place only where an adequate level of protection is ensured and that the data shared
outside the EU/EEA and subsequent access by other entities within the group remains
limited to the minimum necessary for the intended purposes.

Annex III
Right to data portability
1. How can the data controller identify the data subject before answering his request?
There are no prescriptive requirements to be found in the GDPR on how to authenticate the
data subject. Nevertheless, Article 12(2) of the GDPR states that the data controller shall not
refuse to act on request of a data subject for exercising his or her rights (including the right
to data portability) unless it is processing personal data for a purpose that does not require
the identification of a data subject and it can demonstrate that it is not able to identify the
data subject. However, as per Article 11(2), in such circumstances the data subject can
provide more information to enable his or her identification. Additionally, Article 12(6)
provides that where a data controller has reasonable doubts about the identity of a data
subject, it can request further information to confirm the data subject’s identity. Where a
data subject does provide additional information enabling his or her identification, the data
controller shall not refuse to act on the request. Where information and data collected
online is linked to pseudonyms or unique identifiers, data controllers can implement
appropriate procedures enabling an individual to make a data portability request and
receive the data relating to him or her. In any case, data controllers must implement an
authentication procedure in order to strongly ascertain the identity of the data subject
requesting his or her personal data or more generally exercising the rights granted by the
GDPR.
In many cases, such authentication procedures are already in place. For example, usernames
and passwords, including unique generated codes on mobile devices, are often used to
allow individuals to access their data in their email accounts, social networking accounts,
and accounts used for various other services, some of which individuals choose to use
without revealing their full name and identity.
If the size of data requested by the data subject makes transmission via the internet
problematic, rather than potentially allowing for an extended time period of a maximum of
three months to comply with the request, the data controller may also need to consider
alternative means of providing the data such as using streaming or saving to a CD, DVD or
other physical media or allowing for the personal data to be transmitted directly to another
data controller (as per Article 20(2) of the GDPR where technically feasible).

2. What is the expected data format?
The GDPR places requirements on data controllers to provide the personal data requested
by the individual in a format which supports re-use. Specifically, Article 20(1) of the GDPR
states that the personal data must be provided “in a structured, commonly used and
machine-readable format”. Recital 68 provides a further clarification that this format should
be interoperable, a term that is defined in the EU 23as:

23

Article 2 of Decision No 922/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009
on interoperability solutions for European public administrations (ISA) OJ L 260, 03.10.2009, p. 20
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

92

Malta Bankers’ Association

“the ability of disparate and diverse organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial
and agreed common goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between the
organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of
data between their respective ICT systems.”
The terms “structured”, “commonly used” and “machine-readable” are a set of minimal
requirements that should facilitate the interoperability of the data format provided by the
data controller. In that way, “structured, commonly used and machine readable” are
specifications for the means, whereas interoperability is the desired outcome.
Recital 21 of the Directive 2013/37/EU defines “machine readable” as:
“a file format structured so that software applications can easily identify, recognize and
extract specific data, including individual statements of fact, and their internal structure.
Data encoded in files that are structured in a machine-readable format are machinereadable data. Machine-readable formats can be open or proprietary; they can be formal
standards or not. Documents encoded in a file format that limits automatic processing,
because the data cannot, or cannot easily, be extracted from them, should not be considered
to be in a machine-readable format. Member States should where appropriate encourage
the use of open, machine-readable formats.”
Given the wide range of potential data types that could be processed by a data controller,
the GDPR does not impose specific recommendations on the format of the personal data to
be provided. The most appropriate format will differ across sectors and adequate formats
may already exist, but the format chosen should be interpretable. Formats that are subject
to costly licensing constraints would not be considered an adequate approach.
Recital 68 clarifies that “The data subject's right to transmit or receive personal data
concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or
maintain processing systems which are technically compatible.” Thus, portability aims to
produce interoperable systems, not compatible systems. ISO/IEC 2382-01 defines
interoperability as follows: “The capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer
data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no
knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units.”
Personal data are expected to be provided in formats, which have a high level of
abstraction. As such, data portability implies an additional layer of data processing by data
controllers, in order to extract data from the platform and filter out personal data outside
the scope of portability (such as user passwords, payment data, biometric patterns, etc.).
This additional data processing will be considered as an accessory to the main data
processing, since it is not performed to achieve a new purpose defined by the data
controller.
Data controllers should provide as many metadata with the data as possible at the best
possible level of granularity, which preserves the precise meaning of exchanged
information. As an example, providing an individual with .pdf versions of an email inbox
would not be sufficiently structured. E-mail data must be provided in a format which
preserves all the meta-data, to allow the effective re-use of the data. As such, when
selecting a data format in which to provide the personal data, the data controller should
consider how this format would impact or hinder the individual’s right to re-use the data. In
Data Protection Guidelines for Banks

93

Malta Bankers’ Association

cases where a data controller is able to provide choices to the data subject regarding the
preferred format of the personal data a clear explanation of the impact of the choice should
be provided. However, processing additional meta-data on the only assumption that they
might be needed or wanted to answer a data portability request poses no legitimate ground
for such processing.

3. How do you deal with a large or complex personal data collection?
The GDPR does not explain how to address the challenge of responding where a large data
collection, a complex data structure or other technical issues arise, which might create
difficulties for data controllers or data subjects.
However, in all cases, it is crucial that the individual is in a position to fully understand the
definition, schema and structure of the personal data, which could be provided by the data
controller. For instance, data could first be provided in a summarised form using dashboards
allowing the data subject to port subsets of the personal data rather than the entire
catalogue. The data controller should provide an overview “in a concise, transparent,
intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language” preferably (see Article
12(1)) of the GDPR) in such a way that data subject can use software applications to easily
identify, recognize and process specific data from it. One of the ways in which a data
controller can answer requests for data portability is by offering an appropriately secured
and documented Application Programming Interface (API). This would enable individuals to
make requests for their personal data via their own or third-party software or grant
permission for others to do so on their behalf (including another data controller) as specified
in Article 20(2) of the GDPR. By granting access to data via an API, it may be possible to offer
a more sophisticated access system that enables individuals to make subsequent requests
for data, either as a full download or as a delta function containing only changes since the
last download, without these additional requests being onerous on the data controller.

4. How can portable data be secured?
In general, the data controllers should guarantee the “appropriate security of the personal
data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against
accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational
measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’)” according to Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR.
However, the transmission of personal data to the data subject may also raise some security
issues:
As data portability aims to get personal data out of the information system of the data
controller, the transmission may become a possible source of risk regarding those data (in
particular of data breaches during the transmission). The data controller shall implement all
the security measures needed to ensure that personal data is securely transmitted (e.g. by
use of encryption) to the right destination (e.g. by use of additional authentication
information). Such security measures mustn’t be obstructive in nature and must not prevent
users from exercising their rights, e.g by imposing additional costs.

5. How do you help users in securing the storage of their personal data in their own
systems?
By retrieving their personal data from an online service, there is always also the risk that
users may store them in a less secured system than the one provided by the service. The
data subject should be made aware of this in order to take steps to protect the information
they have received. The data controller could also, as a best practice, recommend
appropriate format(s) and encryption measures to help the data subject to achieve this goal.
