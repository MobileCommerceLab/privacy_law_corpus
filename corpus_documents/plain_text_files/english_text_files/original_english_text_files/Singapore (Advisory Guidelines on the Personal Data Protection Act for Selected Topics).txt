PART I: INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
1

Introduction

1.1

The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) establishes a general data
protection law in Singapore which governs the collection, use and disclosure of
individuals’ personal data by organisations. The Personal Data Protection Commission
(the “Commission”) is established under the PDPA with the key functions, amongst
others, of promoting awareness of data protection in Singapore and administering
and enforcing the PDPA.

1.2

These Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the document titled
“Introduction to the Guidelines” and are subject to the disclaimers set out therein.1

1.3

It should be noted that the examples in these Guidelines serve to illustrate particular
aspects of the PDPA, and are not meant to exhaustively address every obligation in
the PDPA that would apply in that scenario.

PART II: SELECTED TOPICS

Analytics and Research
How does the PDPA apply to organisations that want to conduct analytics and
research activities?

2.1

Where the research activities carried out by the organisation require the collection,
use or disclosure of personal data, the organisation is required to comply with the
PDPA. In particular, under the PDPA, individuals have to be informed of and consent
to the purposes for which their personal data are collected, used, and disclosed by
organisations, unless any exception under the PDPA applies. Please see the sections
on “The Consent Obligation” and “The Notification Obligation” in the Key Concepts
Guidelines for more details.

2.2

In respect of the Notification Obligation, an organisation may specify research itself
as a purpose and an individual can give consent specifically for the use of his personal
data for research.

2.3

Alternatively, an organisation may rely on consent given by an individual for a
purpose that does not explicitly cover analytics and research if the purpose of the
analytics and research falls within the original purpose for which consent was given.

2.4

Example:
John signs up for a mobile service with a telecommunications service provider. John
consents to his personal data being collected and used by the service provider for
the purposes of providing him the mobile service. The service provider collects and
analyses some of John’s personal data for the purposes of managing its network and
short term planning enhancements to improve the quality of mobile services
provided to him. Such activities would likely fall within the original purpose John
consented to.
An adventure camp company requires all camp participants to provide emergency
contact information of an individual, which includes personal data like name,
telephone number and address, with consent from the individual. The purpose
stated was to use that personal data to contact the individual in the event of an
emergency relating to the camp participant. The company subsequently analyses
the personal data for the purpose of determining if the individual(s) listed would be
a potential participant for adventure camps. This purpose would not fall within the
original purpose for which the consent was obtained.

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

2.5

2.6

Organisations may also use personal data without consent for a research purpose
under paragraph 1(i) of the Third Schedule to the PDPA, if all the conditions referred
to in that paragraph are fulfilled. Paragraph 1(i) says that an organisation may use
personal data about an individual without the consent of the individual if the personal
data is used for a research purpose, including historical or statistical research, subject
to the conditions in paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 sets out that Paragraph 1(i) shall not
apply unless:
a)

the research purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the
personal data is provided in an individually identifiable form;

b)

it is impracticable for the organisation to seek the consent of the individual
for the use;

c)

the personal data will not be used to contact persons to ask them to
participate in the research; and

d)

linkage of the personal data to other information is not harmful to the
individuals identified by the personal data and the benefits to be derived
from the linkage are clearly in the public interest.

Alternatively, organisations could consider using anonymous data to conduct
research. Anonymised data is not personal data and thus would not be governed by
the PDPA. Please refer to the section on “Anonymisation” in these Guidelines for
more details.

Anonymisation
What is anonymisation?

3.1

In general, anonymisation refers to the process of removing identifying information
such that the remaining data cannot be used to identify any particular individual. The
terminology that has been used to refer to this process varies across different
jurisdictions and sectors. For instance, some jurisdictions use ‘anonymisation’ and
‘de-identification’ interchangeably to refer to the process of converting personal data
into data that can no longer be used to identify an individual, whether alone or in
combination with other available information. Others use ‘anonymisation’ to refer to
de-identification that is irreversible.2 For the purposes of these Guidelines, the term
‘anonymisation’ refers to the process of converting personal data into data that
cannot be used to identify any particular individual, and can be reversible or
irreversible. The reversibility of the specific process used would be a relevant
consideration for organisations when managing the risk of re-identification.

3.2

Anonymisation is a set of risk management controls and has to be understood in the
context of the following definition of personal data under section 2(1) of the PDPA:
“data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified — (a) from that
data; or (b) from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is
likely to have access”. Please see the section on “Personal Data” in the Key Concepts
Guidelines for more details.

3.3

Data would not be considered anonymised if there is a serious possibility that an
individual could be re-identified, taking into consideration both:

3.4

a)

the data itself, or the data combined with other information to which the
organisation has or is likely to have access; and

b)

the measures and safeguards (or lack thereof) implemented by the
organisation to mitigate the risk of identification.

Data that has been anonymised is not personal data, and the Data Protection
Provisions in Parts III to VI of the PDPA do not apply to the collection, use or
disclosure of such data.
Why anonymise personal data?

3.5

Anonymisation of personal data is carried out to render the resultant data suitable
for more uses than its original state would permit under data protection regimes. For

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

example, anonymised data may be used for research and data mining where personal
identifiers in the data are unnecessary or undesired. Anonymised datasets could also
be a protection measure against inadvertent disclosures and security breaches.
3.6

Where individuals need not be identifiable for the purposes in question, it is usually
good practice to collect, use and disclose data in an anonymised form.

3.7

In circumstances where an organisation must cease to retain personal data under
section 25 of the PDPA, the organisation may anonymise the data. By doing so, it will
have ceased to retain personal data, since anonymised data is not personal data.
Anonymisation techniques

3.8

3.9

The following is a non-exhaustive list of commonly used anonymisation techniques,
and examples of how each technique can be used.
Examples of Anonymisation Techniques:
a)

Pseudonymisation: replacing personal identifiers with other references. For
example, replacing an individual’s name with a tag or reference number,
which is randomly generated.

b)

Aggregation: displaying values as totals, so that none of the individual values
which could identify an individual is shown. For example, given a dataset with
the ages of eight individuals (i.e. 33, 35, 34, 37, 42, 45, 37, 40), displaying the
sum of the individual ages of the total number of individuals in a group (i.e.
303), rather than the age of each individual represented discretely.

c)

Replacement: replacing values or a subset of the values with a computed
average or a number derived from the values. For example, replacing the
individuals with ages of 15, 18 and 20 with an age value of 17 to blur the
distinction, if exact age is not required for the desired purposes.

d)

Data suppression: removing values that are not required for the purpose. For
example, removing ‘ethnicity’ from a dataset of individuals’ attributes.

e)

Data recoding or generalisation: banding or grouping of categories into
broader categories. For example, the grouping of exact education level (e.g.
K1, Primary 3, Secondary 2) into broader categories (e.g. pre-primary, primary,
secondary etc.), or hiding the value within a given range (e.g. replacing age
‘43’ with the range ’40-50’).

10

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

3.10

f)

Data shuffling: mixing up or replacing values with those of the same type so
that the information looks similar but is unrelated to the actual details. For
example, the surnames in a customer database could be sanitised by replacing
them with those drawn from another database.

g)

Masking: removing certain details while preserving the look and feel of the
data. For example, representing a full string of NRIC numbers as ‘#####567A’
instead of ‘S1234567A’.

The Commission does not recommend or endorse the use of any particular technique.
Organisations should make their own assessment of their situation(s) and operational
context, and adopt the most appropriate anonymisation technique.
Considerations for anonymising data

3.11

When deciding whether to anonymise data for use or disclosure, organisations should
keep in mind that not all datasets can be effectively or meaningfully anonymised. The
following section elaborates on some relevant considerations.
Nature and type of data

3.12

The nature of the dataset affects how much identifying information needs to be
removed so that it no longer can be used to identify individuals. Some data types are
inherently ‘rich’ and full of information (e.g. portrait photographs taken for facial
recognition purposes), such that any alteration to anonymise the data might render
it useless for its intended purposes.

3.13

The uniqueness of a record or data point within a sample dataset or population also
contributes to the challenge of anonymisation. There are instances where the use of
particular methods may not anonymise the dataset, because data points for certain
individuals remain unique. For example, a dataset containing the ages of individuals
has one outlier of age 89 while the other ages are below 50. No matter how the ages
are generalised or recoded into ranges, the data point for the 89-year-old stands out.
Where there are records or data points that are unique to the population or sample
(i.e. population unique or sample unique)3 the risk of re-identification increases.
Organisations must be careful to manage these risks, and ensure that the dataset is
effectively anonymised.

Potential impact on individuals
3.14

When deciding whether to anonymise personal data for use or disclosure,
organisations should also consider any potential negative impact on the individuals if
they were to be re-identified. This is particularly important if the personal data
involved is of a highly sensitive nature, (e.g. records of individuals with HIV, records
of adopted children and their biological parents). In such circumstances, even if the
organisation assesses that there is a less than serious possibility of an individual being
identified from the data, the organisation should carefully consider whether using or
disclosing such data would be appropriate.
Assessing the risks of re-identification

3.15

Re-identification can occur as a result of combining separate datasets. When
determining whether a dataset is anonymised, the organisation should consider
whether there is a serious possibility that an individual can be identified from the
dataset when it is combined with other information, by carrying out an assessment
of the risk of re-identification. In general, factors affecting the risk of re-identification
include the extent of disclosure, the amount of alteration the data has been subjected
to in the course of anonymisation, the availability of other relevant information, and
the recipients’ ability and motivation to re-identify the data. Some of the
considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Nature of use and extent of disclosure

3.16

Organisations should consider how the nature of use and extent of disclosure of the
anonymised data can affect the risk of re-identification. In general, where an
organisation intends to use the anonymised data within the organisation itself, or
where the organisation intends to disclose anonymised data only to a restricted
group (or groups) of users (e.g. a closed community of researchers), re-identification
risks can be managed better, compared to the situation where the organisation
discloses the anonymised data to any users by publishing it.
Public knowledge and personal knowledge

3.17

Organisations should consider the types of information that could enable reidentification if combined with the anonymised data, as well as the ease with which
such information can be accessed. It is necessary to understand the intended use and
recipient of the anonymised data to perform this assessment and tailor an
appropriate set of risk management controls for the intended use and recipient. For
example, the risk of re-identification in a disclosure of data to a single entity for
research and development of new products and services under a non-disclosure

12

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

agreement, would likely differ from the risk of re-identification in publishing the data
to the world at large.
3.18

Even after the risks of re-identification have been assessed and appropriate controls
implemented, the risk of spontaneous re-identification of data by persons with
special knowledge of a particular individual can occur. For example, a patient’s
attending physician, who is also conducting medical research using datasets
containing the patient’s data, may be able to recognise the patient’s medical profile
from the data (even if such data may be assessed to be anonymised if the recipient
did not have such special knowledge). If it is known or foreseeable to the organisation
that the data might be accessed by any persons with special knowledge that could be
used to re-identify any individual from the data, such risk must be accounted for in
the risk assessment exercise.
Disclosing multiple datasets

3.19

3.20

If an organisation intends to disclose multiple anonymised datasets (e.g. by publishing
seemingly unrelated datasets as part of an open data initiative), organisations should
carry out a careful assessment of the risk of re-identification from such a disclosure,
particularly if those datasets are extracted from the same database. Organisations
would have to take particular care to ensure that risk management controls are
adequate to prevent re-identification of individuals by the recipient organisation,
particularly when the datasets are combined with each other or with additional
datasets previously released by the organisation. Organisations could consider
maintaining a centralised record to track datasets that have been disclosed or
published.
Example: Publishing multiple datasets
As part of an open data initiative, two divisions in Company WXY have
independently decided to release related datasets, unaware of the other division’s
intentions. Both divisions then carried out assessments with incomplete and
inaccurate information about the datasets being released by other divisions in the
company.
If each division then proceeds to publish their own datasets, this may increase the
risk of re-identification where the two datasets are related.
Data recipient’s ability and motivation to re-identify

3.21

The risk of re-identification is likely to differ depending on the ability and the
motivation of the data recipient to re-identify individuals from the dataset. A data
13

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

recipient in possession of complementary information, specialised skills or
technologies would more likely be capable of re-identifying individuals from the data
than one that does not, assuming both have similar motivations.
3.22

Example:
Anonymised dataset Y contains complex genome sequencing, a specialised type of
data not easily understood by the layman.
If the data recipient is an expert in genome sequencing, and understands how to
identify individuals from such a dataset, the risk of re-identification may be higher.
In contrast, if the data recipient has no knowledge of that data type, the risk reidentification would be comparatively lower.

3.23

Even if the data recipient has the requisite skills and information for re-identification,
it does not necessarily mean the risk of re-identification is high. The motivation to reidentify must also be considered. The motivation to re-identify an individual may be
low if there are barriers to re-identification, such as legal (e.g. via contractual
obligations) or regulatory consequences (e.g. pursuant to government regulations or
legally binding industry codes issued by regulators), for the data recipient, or if there
is simply no incentive or benefit for a data recipient to re-identify individuals.
Changing environment

3.24

While a dataset may be anonymised at a particular point in time, it is not guaranteed
that the dataset will stay anonymised permanently. The likelihood of re-identification
for any given anonymised dataset is likely to increase over time, due to greater ease
of access to and volume of other relevant information, increase in computing power,
and improvements in data-linking techniques. A dataset that is sufficiently
anonymised based on current technology might be more easily re-identified with
technological advancements.

3.25

The adequacy of anonymisation techniques and risk management controls would
have to be assessed in relation to the current state of technology. However, it is also
important to build in robust organisational, legal and non-technical measures to
manage the risks of re-identification, taking into account the possibility of
technological developments over the period for which the data may be retained.
Therefore, organisations should consider whether periodic re-assessment of reidentification risks should be included as a safeguard, particularly where there are
developments that would significantly affect the risk of re-identification, or where
anonymised data is disclosed and available over an extended period of time, for
example in an ongoing relationship. For example, if the encryption used for
14

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

anonymisation of a particular dataset has been compromised, organisations should
re-assess the risk of that anonymised dataset being re-identified and put in place
additional safeguards to mitigate such risk.
General test for assessing risks of re-identification
3.26

As a general test for assessing the risks of re-identification and the robustness of the
anonymisation, a useful starting point is the ‘motivated intruder’ test highlighted in
the ICO’s Code of Practice Anonymisation: Managing Data Protection Risk Code of
Practice, which we adapt to our vernacular.

3.27

The ‘motivated intruder’ test considers whether individuals can be re-identified from
anonymised data by someone who is motivated, reasonably competent, has access
to standard resources (e.g. the Internet and published information such as public
directories), and employs standard investigative techniques (e.g. making enquiries of
people who may have additional knowledge of the identity of the data subject).

3.28

As anonymisation is a package of risk control measures tailored to the purpose of
disclosure and the recipient, the ‘motivated intruder’ test has to accommodate the
features of the intended recipient organisation.4
a)

The assessment should include the totality of the risk management controls
that are applicable to the recipient organisation. This refers to both
technical measures as well as legal, regulatory or organisational measures.
For example, the risk assessment could take into account the kind of
safeguards accorded to the data, or how long the data is to be retained,
among others.

b)

The ‘motivated intruder’ test assumes that no particular individual has been
targeted for identification and that the intruder does not resort to
criminality or any specialist equipment or skills.

c)

Where disclosure of a particular dataset is to a specific recipient whose
motivations, re-identification capabilities, and other information available
to that recipient are known or can be reasonably inferred, these known
characteristics should also be accounted for.

d)

In addition, the risk assessment for re-identification should also consider
the other factors (not specific to anonymised data) that subject the
anonymised data to re-identification risks. This includes all other ‘residual’

4

This can include disclosures to the public in cases where the dataset is published as part of open data efforts
or in a publication that is freely available.
15

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

risks that are not directly related to a recipient’s motivation and capability
to re-identify or the risk management controls for the disclosed
anonymised data; for example, risk of the data being compromised or
mistakenly disclosed to unintended recipients.
Managing the risks of re-identification when using or disclosing anonymised data
3.29

Before using or disclosing anonymised data, the organisation should apply the
appropriate anonymisation techniques to ensure robust anonymisation of the data.
In general, the Commission would consider an organisation to have anonymised data
if there is no serious possibility that a data user or recipient would be able to identify
any individuals from the data.

3.30

When determining which anonymisation technique to adopt, some relevant
considerations could include:
a)

the nature or type of data to be anonymised; and/or

b)

international best practices for anonymisation of the given data type.

3.31

Organisations may consider hiring anonymisation experts, statisticians, or
independent risk assessors, to aid in their assessment of the appropriate
anonymisation techniques to apply, particularly where the anonymisation issues are
complex; for example, large datasets containing a wide range of personal data.

3.32

To further manage its risks, organisations may also consider putting in place other
appropriate controls to lower the risk of re-identification, like:

3.33

a)

limiting the number of data recipients to whom the information is disclosed
and the number of persons that can access the information;

b)

imposing restrictions on the data recipient on the use and subsequent
disclosure of the data;

c)

requiring the data recipient to implement processes to govern the proper
use of the anonymised data in line with the restrictions; and/or

d)

requiring the data recipient to implement processes and measures for the
destruction of data as soon as the data no longer serves any business or
legal purpose.

In addition, organisations may put in place controls to limit the data users’ or
recipients’ access to “other information” that could re-identify the anonymised data.
Depending on the circumstances, controls could be implemented through:

16

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

a)

organisational structures;

b)

legally binding agreements, administrative rules, or policies;

c)

technical measures (e.g. using encryption to restrict access to the original
dataset, limiting access to only authorised users, and controlling access
through passwords); and/or

d)

physical measures (e.g. restricted access areas).

3.34

It is not necessary that the most technically sophisticated anonymisation technology
be used all the time. Rather, what is required is one that is sufficiently robust to
manage the risk of re-identification, given the circumstances (e.g. the extent of
disclosure, the intended recipient(s) and existing controls).

3.35

In the event that an organisation intentionally re-identifies an individual, such
deliberate actions will constitute collection of personal data, for which consent is
required from the relevant individual. There may be situations where the reidentification is unintentional. Generally, unintentional re-identification is not
considered collection of personal data. However, the organisation should
immediately delete the personal data or re-identifying information and should
evaluate whether the risk management controls in place are adequate. If the
organisation uses or discloses such unintentionally re-identified personal data, its
actions will be considered to be use or disclosure of personal data. Generally, where
such collection, use or disclosure is carried out for a purpose to which the relevant
individuals did not consent5, the organisation will have breached its PDPA obligations.

3.36

Given that management and assessment of re-identification risks is dependent on the
circumstances of the use or disclosure, the following scenarios illustrate how reidentification risks can be assessed and managed in certain circumstances.
Use of anonymised data within the organisation

3.37

In general, if the departments within an organisation have, or are likely to have,
access to other information (e.g. the decryption key or algorithm to reverse the
anonymisation process) that can be combined with the data to re-identify individuals,
the data will be considered personal data. and the Data Protection Provisions in Parts
III to VI of the PDPA will apply.

3.38

Conversely, if anonymisation techniques and risk mitigation measures have been
applied such that there is no serious possibility that the data can be used to identify

5

And no relevant exception under the PDPA applies.
17

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

any individual, the Commission would consider such data anonymised. The Data
Protection Provisions of the PDPA would not apply. For example, deploying one-way
encryption in order to anonymise customer data for long term archival purposes.
3.39

3.40

There may be circumstances where an organisation wishes to convert personal data
into anonymised datasets to be used for a particular purpose. However, the
organisation may need to retain the original dataset or other information that can reidentify the individuals from the anonymised datasets for other purposes. In such
situations, anonymisation can be relevant to the safe use of data for a particular
purpose within an organisation. Organisational structures should establish effective
barriers to access, by a group (or groups) of users within the organisation, to other
information (e.g. the decryption key or algorithm that could reverse the
anonymisation) held by the organisation that could be used to re-identify an
individual.
Example:
Department A and Department B are two departments within Organisation JKL.
Department A manages personal data collected by the organisation for the purpose
of customer relations. Department B wishes to use the data for business analytics
purpose but does not require individually identifiable data. Department A proceeds
to anonymise the data such that the anonymised dataset can no longer identify any
individual.
Organisation JKL puts in place controls on Department B to prevent re-identification
of the anonymised dataset. This includes access restrictions to prevent data users
in Department B from gaining access to other information held by Department A
that can lead to re-identification, as well as administrative restrictions to prevent
Department B from attempting re-identification. Organisation JKL also makes the
unauthorised attempt to re-identify individuals from the anonymised dataset a
breach of the terms of employment.
Department B could be considered to be using anonymised data given that effective
controls are imposed on Department B to prevent re-identification.

3.41

Once data is anonymised, in general, organisations must not be able to, in effect, use
the same data as personal data (e.g. the data cannot be used to make a decision
about, or in a manner that has a targeted impact on a specific individual). If
organisations are, in effect, using the data as personal data, then organisations must
ensure that consent has been obtained for such use, unless any exceptions apply.

18

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

3.42

Organisations must also be mindful of subsequent actions in respect of the
anonymised data that could increase the risk of re-identification. For example, the
Commission would consider there to be a serious possibility that an individual could
be identified, if there are any subsequent disclosures of the anonymised data or
information relating to the anonymised data to persons outside of Department B (e.g.
where no effective controls are imposed on the recipients), and no further riskmitigation measures are taken. Given that Department A holds the decryption key or
other information (e.g. master database) that could be used to re-identify individuals
from the anonymised data, the organisation must ensure the robust anonymisation
of the dataset before any further disclosure (e.g. this may include further scrambling
of the data).
Disclosure of anonymised data to a specific group (or groups) or data recipients

3.43

There may be instances where an organisation converts personal data into
anonymised data in order to disclose it to a specific group (or groups) of recipients
outside the organisation for other purposes, while the organisation continues to have
access to other information that can re-identify the individuals (e.g. the decryption
key or algorithm to reverse the anonymisation process). The risks of re-identification
can be better managed where the recipients are limited to a specific group known to
the disclosing organisation, compared to a disclosure to the world at large.

3.44

The Commission will consider it use or disclosure of anonymised data where the data
is used by or disclosed to a specific group (or groups) of data users or recipients such
that there is no serious possibility that any data user or recipient would be able to
identify any individuals from the data. The Data Protection Provisions in Parts III to
VI of the PDPA would not apply to such use and disclosure. In such instances, the
recipients of the data cannot use it to make a decision about, or otherwise use in a
manner that has an impact on, any specific individual.

3.45

Where disclosure of anonymised data is restricted to specific data recipients (e.g. a
closed group of researchers) for their own use, without any further disclosure, the
disclosing organisation may consider adopting legal measures to discourage any
attempts by the data recipients to re-identify individuals from the anonymised data.
For example, the disclosing organisation could put in place contractual safeguards, or
require an undertaking from the data recipients not to attempt to re-identify the
anonymised data. The disclosing organisation could also require that the data
recipients put in place additional measures, such as governance frameworks,
processes, and controls, to ensure the proper handling of the dataset and further
reduce the risk of re-identification.

19

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

3.46

3.47

Further considerations when disclosing anonymised data are discussed in the
previous section on “Managing the risks of re-identification when using or disclosing
anonymised data”.
Example:
Organisation JKL (disclosing organisation) intends to disclose an anonymised dataset
to Organisation XYZ (data recipient). As part of its contractual agreement,
Organisation XYZ has committed not to attempt re-identification of the dataset or
to further disclose the anonymised data to another organisation.
Organisation JKL also contractually requires that Organisation XYZ puts in place
governance frameworks and controls to ensure the proper handling of the dataset,
including:
a)

limiting the number of Organisation XYZ’s employees who can access the
anonymised dataset;

b)

requiring Organisation XYZ’s employees authorised to access the dataset to
be trained on data protection practices; and

c)

applying appropriate technical solutions to ensure better access controls (e.g.
technical measures that limit employees’ access to the dataset and the
copying of or number of copies of the dataset).

Organisation JKL follows through with periodic reviews of the governance
frameworks and controls that Organisation XYZ has put in place.
3.48

In assessing the anonymisation and risk of re-identification of any dataset, the
Commission will take a holistic view, not restricted to the measures discussed above,
and include any other relevant facts of the case. For example, even if a disclosing
organisation has employed robust anonymisation techniques and put in place legal
safeguards to prevent attempts to re-identify and further disclose the anonymised
data, if there are serious doubts about the reliability or reputation of the receiving
organisation (e.g. in ensuring the proper use and handling of anonymised datasets),
the Commission may consider the risk of re-identification significant, and the
disclosure to be of personal data. On the other hand, the disclosure of anonymised
data to a group of recipients with demonstrated reliability in ensuring the proper use
and handling of anonymised datasets may be assessed to be of lower risk.

3.49

If there is no serious possibility that individuals could be identified from the disclosed
dataset, the Commission would consider it a disclosure of anonymised data, and the
20

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Data Protection Provisions in Parts III to VI of the PDPA would not apply to that
disclosure.
3.50

Example:
Organisation JKL (disclosing organisation) discloses an anonymised dataset to
Organisation XYZ (data recipient), referred to as the Initial Disclosure. Organisation
JKL lowers the risk of re-identification at the point of disclosure by:
a)

Ensuring that the anonymisation techniques applied to the data set are
robust;

b)

Contractually requiring Organisation XYZ not to attempt re-identification or
further disclosure of the anonymised data to another organisation;

c)

Contractually requiring Organisation XYZ to put in place governance
frameworks and controls to ensure proper handling of the dataset;

d)

Ensuring that Organisation XYZ is a reliable organisation and has a good track
record of adequate data protection.

After receiving the dataset, Organisation XYZ decides that there is good reason for
it to publish the dataset, and decides to do so (referred to as the Subsequent
Disclosure), with the knowledge that this would constitute a breach of contract with
Organisation JKL. An individual is subsequently re-identified from the published
dataset.
Generally, when determining whether Organisation JKL disclosed personal data or
anonymised data during the Initial Disclosure, the Commission would consider
whether Organisation JKL had implemented appropriate measures and safeguards,
such that there was no serious possibility that individuals would have been
identifiable, at the time of the Initial Disclosure.
When investigating whether Organisation XYZ disclosed personal or anonymised
data during the Subsequent Disclosure, the Commission will assess the measures
and safeguards, taking into account that the Subsequent Disclosure was not limited
to a specific data recipient but published to a wider audience.

Photography, Video and Audio Recordings

4.1

Photography, video and audio recordings are increasingly ubiquitous with such
capabilities being included in more devices. While not all photographs, video and
audio recordings capture personal data, some clearly do.

4.2

An image of an identifiable individual captured in a photograph or video recording is
personal data about that individual. An audio recording may comprise personal data
if an individual can be identified from that audio recording, or from that recording
and other information that the organisation has or is likely to have access to. For
example, an individual may be identified from his voice6, or voice and other
information disclosed in or related to the audio recording, or from his voice coupled
with his image captured in a video recording of the individual.

4.3

The Commission does not expect that the PDPA will greatly affect adoption of such
technologies. Nevertheless, the Commission considers it useful to provide guidance
on certain applications of the Data Protection Provisions in the PDPA to photography,
video and audio recordings, including those recorded through the use of ClosedCircuit Television Cameras (“CCTVs”) and drones.

4.4

The following sections and examples outline certain concepts and the application of
some of the Data Protection Provisions in the PDPA to photography, video and audio
recordings. It should be noted that the scenarios provided address particular aspects
of the PDPA, and are not meant to exhaustively address every obligation in the PDPA
that would apply in that scenario.

6

An individual may be identified from his voice, for example, where the voice clip is sufficiently clear and of a
sufficient duration.
22

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Photography and Videography
Does a photographer or videographer need to obtain an individual’s consent to take
a photograph or video recording of the individual?
4.5

Among other obligations, the Data Protection Provisions require consent from the
individual to be obtained for the purposes of the collection, use or disclosure of his
personal data. Exceptions to this Consent Obligation may apply depending on the
circumstances, for example where the photographer is acting in his personal or
domestic capacity, such as when he takes photographs or video recordings for his
own personal purposes at a gathering for family and friends.

4.6

A professional photographer or videographer who takes a photograph or video
recording of an identifiable individual in the course of his business will be required
to obtain consent unless he is taking the photograph or video recording on behalf of
and for the purposes of another organisation pursuant to a contract in writing. In
such a situation, the other organisation will be required to comply with the Data
Protection Provisions. Similarly, if the photographer or videographer is an employee
acting in the course of his employment with an organisation, he will not be required
to comply with the Data Protection Provisions and instead his employer will be
required to comply7. In this regard, it would be advisable for employers to put in
place systems and processes to prevent employees from engaging in conduct that
could cause the organisation to breach the Data Protection Provisions.

4.7

Example: Photo-taking by an individual acting in a personal or domestic capacity
Diana, an employee of Organisation XYZ, attends Organisation XYZ’s corporate social
responsibility event. At the event, she meets her friend Dawn. During a break in the
programme, they have a personal chat and catch up on each other’s personal lives.
During the chat, Diana takes a photograph of the two of them to update her friends
of the encounter via social media. Diana then uploads the photograph and displays it
on her personal social media page.
In this instance, Diana would likely be considered to be an individual acting in a
personal or domestic capacity, and would not be required to comply with the Data

7

Section 53(1) of the PDPA provides that any act done or conduct engaged in by a person in the course of his
employment shall be treated as done or engaged in by his employer as well as by him, whether or not it was
done or engaged in with the employer’s knowledge or approval. In reality, whether the individual is acting in the
course of employment may not always be clear and may require a factual inquiry.
23

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Protection Provisions in respect of the photo-taking and subsequent disclosure of the
photograph via her social media account.
Notwithstanding the above, the Data Protection Provisions may apply in other
contexts where Diana is not acting in a personal or domestic capacity. For example,
if the photograph is subsequently published for Organisation XYZ’s publicity purposes
(such as in Organisation XYZ’s corporate brochures or website) instead of for Diana’s
personal purposes, the Data Protection Provisions are likely to apply to Organisation
XYZ in respect of the collection, use and disclosure of the photograph. For example,
Organisation XYZ will have to obtain Dawn’s consent before publishing her
photograph for Organisation XYZ’s business purpose.
4.8

Example: Video recording by an individual acting as an employee
Eric, another employee of Organisation XYZ, is tasked by the management of
Organisation XYZ to take video recordings at the corporate social responsibility event
and make them available on Organisation XYZ’s webpage. In this instance, as Eric is
an employee acting in the course of his employment with Organisation XYZ where he
takes video recordings for his assigned purpose, the PDPA does not impose the Data
Protection Provisions on him directly. Organisation XYZ would be required to comply
with the Data Protection Provisions instead. As a practical measure, Organisation XYZ
may assign Eric to ensure its compliance with certain obligations, such as obtaining
consent from the individuals that Eric takes video recordings of. In this regard, please
refer to subsequent sections of these guidelines for information on obtaining consent.
Does a photographer or videographer need to obtain an individual’s consent to take
a photograph or video recording of the individual in a public place?

4.9

The PDPA sets out various exceptions to the Consent Obligation. An organisation may
wish to evaluate whether any exception applies in respect of its particular
circumstances. In particular, there is an exception for the collection, use and
disclosure of personal data that is publicly available8. For example, when the
individual appears at an event or location that is open to the public, taking a
photograph of the individual would likely be collection of personal data that is
publicly available for which consent is not required. In this regard, the Commission
has set out that a location or event would be considered “open to the public” if
members of the public can enter or access the location with few or no restrictions,

8

Under the PDPA, “publicly available”, in relation to personal data about an individual, means personal data
that is generally available to the public, and includes personal data which can be observed by reasonably
expected means at a location or an event at which the individual appears and that is open to the public.
24

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

and generally a location would less likely be considered “open to the public” if there
are more restrictions to access. Further, there can be private spaces within public
spaces, and a location is not open to the public merely because members of the
public may look into the premises or location. As good practice, an organisation that
collects, uses or discloses personal data that is publicly available may still wish to
obtain consent from the individuals in question. Please refer to the Key Concepts
Guidelines for a more detailed discussion on this exception.
How may an individual’s consent be obtained for photo-taking or video recording at
a private event/space?
4.10

The Data Protection Provisions do not prescribe the ways in which consent may be
obtained for photo-taking or video recording. As set out in the Key Concepts
Guidelines, consent can be obtained in various ways. Generally, as good practice, an
organisation should obtain consent that is in writing or recorded in a manner that is
accessible for future reference, for example, as the organisation may be required to
prove that it had obtained consent.

4.11

In addition, consent may be deemed to have been given by an individual in situations
where the individual voluntarily provides his personal data to an organisation for a
purpose, and it is reasonable that he would voluntarily provide the data. In the
context of photo-taking or video recording, deemed consent may apply where the
individual voluntarily permits a photograph or video recording to be taken of him for
the organisation’s intended purpose, and it is reasonable that he would do so.

4.12

Please refer to the Key Concepts Guidelines for further elaboration on the Consent
Obligation.

4.13

Examples: Consent for photo-taking at a private function
Organisation ABC holds a private function for a select group of invited clients and
wishes to take photographs of attendees for its internal newsletter with their consent.
In fulfilling its obligation to obtain consent, the measures that Organisation ABC may
take to better ensure that the attendees are aware of the purpose for which their
photographs are collected, used and disclosed, could include:
a)

Clearly stating in its invitation to clients that photographs of attendees will be
taken at the function for publication in its internal newsletter; or

25

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

b)

Putting up an obvious notice at the reception or entrance of the function
venue to inform attendees that photographs will be taken at the event for
publication in its internal newsletter.

Alternatively, Organisation ABC may obtain consent from the attendees by clearly
indicating that photographs will be taken at the event for its corporate purposes on
the confirmation of attendance form which guests would sign and return to the
organisation. In this case, Organisation ABC would be considered to have obtained
consent from the guests who signed and returned the form.
4.14

Kevin attends Organisation DEF’s private function. During the function, Organisation
DEF’s photographer informs Kevin that she is taking photographs for publication in
Organisation DEF’s internal newsletter, and asks Kevin if he would like to have his
photograph taken. By allowing his photograph to be taken, Kevin would be
considered to have given consent for the photograph to be collected, used or
disclosed for the stated purpose.
To better ensure that guests are aware of the purpose of photo-taking, Organisation
DEF may wish to take actions such as those in paragraph 4.13.
For avoidance of doubt, Organisation DEF’s photographer would not need to
separately obtain consent from attendees if their consent had already been obtained
by Organisation DEF for such photo-taking at the function, e.g. in the circumstances
described in paragraph 4.13 above.
Is a photographer or videographer required to obtain consent from individuals in the
background when a photograph or video recording is taken?

4.15

As noted above, consent will generally be required for taking a photograph or video
recording of an identifiable individual although consent may be deemed to have
been given, or an exception may apply, depending on the circumstances. This is true
as well for identifiable individuals who are in the background when a photograph or
video recording is taken. It should also be noted that where an individual in the
background is not identifiable from the photograph or video recording (such as if the
image is too small or obscured), the photograph or video recording will not
constitute personal data of that individual.

26

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Do professional photographers or videographers 9 need to sign contracts with the
event organiser before they can provide photography or videography services at an
event?
4.16

The PDPA does not prescribe the contractual arrangements that organisations may
wish to enter into in order to ensure that they comply with their obligations under
the PDPA. Where they do enter into such a contract, the PDPA provides that the
performance of a contractual obligation shall not be an excuse for contravening the
PDPA10.

4.17

The PDPA does not require a professional photographer or videographer to enter
into a contract with an event organiser. However, it would be a good practice for
the parties to enter into a contract. Generally, if a professional photographer or
videographer is engaged by an organisation to take photographs or video recordings
of identifiable individuals, and wishes to be considered a data intermediary
processing personal data on behalf of and for the purposes of the organisation
pursuant to a contract that is evidenced or made in writing11, the photographer or
videographer should enter into such a contract, which may set out (among other
things) each party’s responsibilities and liabilities, including the scope of the
photographer’s or videographer’s obligation to process personal data on behalf of
and for the purposes of the organisation that engaged him. The organisation on
whose behalf the photographer or videographer is acting may also wish to stipulate
in a contract security and other data protection obligations on the photographer or
videographer in order to ensure that the organisation does not contravene its
obligations under the PDPA.

4.18

Where the photographer or videographer is not a data intermediary processing
personal data on behalf of and for the purposes of the organisation pursuant to a
contract that is evidenced or made in writing, he would be subject to all the
obligations under the Data Protection Provisions, unless any relevant exception
applies. For example, the photographer or videographer would be required to obtain
consent on or before taking a photograph or video recording of an identifiable
individual, unless an exception to the Consent Obligation applies.

9

The term “professional photographer or videographer” in this section encompasses self-employed individuals
as well as organisations that provide professional photography or videography services.
10

Section 4(6)(a) of the PDPA.

11

In such instances, the professional photographer or videographer would only be required to comply with the
Protection Obligation and Retention Limitation Obligation, and would not be required to comply with the
remaining obligations under the Data Protection Provisions (including the Consent Obligation).
27

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

4.19

Example: Whether a professional videographer is a data intermediary processing
personal data on behalf of and for the purpose of another organisation pursuant to
contract evidenced or made in writing
Abel, a freelance videographer, is hired by Organisation ABC to be its videographer at
its private function. Abel and Organisation ABC sign a contract that clearly states
(among other things) that Abel will be taking video recordings at the function on
behalf of and for the purposes of Organisation ABC, and that Organisation ABC will
obtain consent from the attendees. In such an instance, Abel will be considered a
data intermediary processing personal data on behalf of and for the purposes of
another organisation pursuant to a contract that is evidenced or made in writing, and
Abel need not obtain consent from the individuals he takes video recordings of at the
event.
After the function, Abel selects some of the video recordings and publishes them on
his webpage to promote his work. Abel will not be considered a data intermediary
and will be required to comply with the Data Protection Provisions, including
obtaining consent from the individuals in the video recordings in order to use or
disclose the video recordings for this purpose.
In another engagement, Abel is hired by Alice, an individual acting in her personal or
domestic capacity, to be her videographer at her private function. Abel will be
considered a data intermediary subject only to the Protection and Retention
Limitation Obligations where he processes personal data on behalf of and for the
purposes of Alice, pursuant to a contract that is evidenced or made in writing. In the
absence of such contract, Abel will be required to comply with all the Data Protection
Provisions.
Does the exception for collection of personal data “solely for artistic or literary
purposes” apply to the taking of photographs or video recordings of individuals?

4.20

In accordance with paragraph 1(g) of the Second Schedule, an organisation is
permitted to collect personal data about an individual without the individual’s
consent if the personal data is collected solely for artistic or literary purposes. Such
collected data may also be used or disclosed for purposes consistent with the
purpose of collection.

4.21

The terms “artistic” and “literary” are not specifically defined in the PDPA. The
Commission is of the view that it would likely be in line with the purpose of the PDPA
for these terms to take their ordinary meanings. However, the Commission notes
that the parameters as to what would constitute “artistic” purposes may be strongly
28

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

subjective. Accordingly, while organisations taking photographs or video recordings
solely for artistic or literary purposes may rely on the exception, where it is feasible
for organisations to obtain the individual’s consent before taking a photograph or
video recording of the individual or where it is uncertain that an organisation’s
purpose would be considered solely “artistic” or “literary”, the Commission would
advise organisations to obtain the individual’s consent as best practice.
Is an individual who submits a photograph or video recording taken when acting in a
personal or domestic capacity for a competition, still acting in a personal or domestic
capacity?
4.22

4.23

An individual’s submission of a photograph or video recording for a competition is,
on its own, insufficient to determine whether he is acting in a personal or domestic
capacity. Such a determination would have to be made based on all the material
facts of the case.
Examples: Submission of photographs for a competition
Alan is a professional photographer. He takes a photograph of his aunt Betty at a
family event, and subsequently submits it for a competition for professional freelance
photographers organised by Organisation ABC. The winner of the competition will
receive a contract to provide services as the official photographer at an event
conducted by Organisation ABC. Alan is unlikely to be considered to be acting in a
personal or domestic capacity, and the Data Protection Provisions will apply to his use
or disclosure of the personal data unless any other exceptions apply.

4.24

Alan submits the same photograph of his aunt Betty for a photography competition
organised by Social & Recreational Club DEF on the club member’s favourite family
member. The competition is open to all members of the social and recreational club
and the prize is a free holiday for the winner and his favourite family member. Alan
is likely to be considered to be acting in a personal or domestic capacity, and the Data
Protection Provisions will not apply to his use or disclosure of the personal data.
Can individuals withdraw consent for the publication of photographs or video
recordings, or request under the PDPA for the removal of photographs or video
recordings that have been published?

4.25

The PDPA provides that individuals may at any time withdraw any consent given or
deemed to have been given under the PDPA for the collection, use or disclosure of
their personal data for any purpose by an organisation by giving reasonable notice

29

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

to the organisation12. An organisation that receives notice of the withdrawal of
consent must (among other things) cease, and cause its data intermediaries and
agents to cease, to collect, use or disclose the photographs or video recordings, as
the case may be (unless an exception applies).
4.26

Where an organisation has already collected the personal data, the withdrawal of
consent will only apply to its continued use or future disclosure. However, this does
not affect an organisation’s collection, use and disclosure of personal data without
consent where this is required or authorised under the PDPA or other written law.
In such cases, organisations may consider refraining from any future collection, use
or disclosure of the personal data as a matter of discretion. Paragraph 4.30 below
provides an example of how an organisation may give effect to an individual’s
withdrawal of consent when it relates to a photograph or video recording of a group
of individuals.

4.27

Where photographs or video recordings of an identifiable individual have been taken
(for example, where the photographs or video recordings are taken for marketing
purposes) but have yet to be published in a publicly available manner, the individual
may withdraw consent for the collection, use or disclosure of the photographs or
video recordings in accordance with the PDPA. The withdrawal of consent would
affect all continued use and future disclosure. For avoidance of doubt, the
withdrawal of consent would not affect any requirement or authorisation under any
written law to collect, use or disclose personal data without consent. For example,
under the PDPA, organisations are not required to obtain consent for the collection,
use or disclosure of publicly available personal data. In such cases, an organisation
that receives a withdrawal of consent may wish to cease further use or disclosure of
the photographs or video recordings in question as good practice.

4.28

The PDPA does not provide a right for individuals to request that an organisation
ceases to retain their personal data per se. Thus, an organisation which receives a
notice of withdrawal of consent for publication of a photograph or video recording
is not necessarily required to delete that photograph or video recording from all its
records and documents, and may retain personal data in accordance with the
Retention Limitation Obligation (e.g. where retention is necessary for legal or
business purposes). However, where the organisation’s activities involving the
personal data are in breach of the Data Protection Provisions, the organisation may
be directed by the Commission to (among other things) cease retaining such personal
data.

12

Please refer to the sections in the Key Concepts Guidelines relating to withdrawal of consent for more details.
30

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

4.29

Example: Withdrawal of consent for publication in an annual report
Organisation ABC publishes a photograph of a client, Mr Y, in its annual report
distributed to shareholders and clients. Mr Y subsequently withdraws his consent to
the publication of the photograph. Organisation ABC is required under the PDPA to
cease future publication of the photograph, unless such disclosure without Mr Y’s
consent is required or authorised under the PDPA or other written law, for example,
if the photograph is already publicly available. However, it is not required to recall
copies of its annual report, which had been circulated prior to the withdrawal, so as
to remove the photograph. It may also be able to continue to retain the photograph
subject to the Retention Limitation Obligation.

4.30

Example: Withdrawal of consent by an individual in a group photograph
Organisation ABC obtains consent from and takes a photograph of a group of
individuals at a private event, for publication in its internal newsletter. A member of
that group, Mr Z, subsequently withdraws his consent for the publication of the
photograph. Organisation ABC is required under the PDPA to cease future publication
of the photograph, unless such disclosure without Mr Z’s consent is required or
authorised under the PDPA or other written law, for example, if the photograph is
already publicly available, or Organisation ABC is able to effect the withdrawal of
consent (e.g. by masking the image of the individual) before publishing the
photograph.

4.31

Example: Collection in breach of Data Protection Provisions
Jessie informs Organisation XYZ that it had collected her personal data without her
consent by taking an identifiable video recording of her, and asks it to destroy the
video recording. Organisation XYZ determines that its collection (and any subsequent
use or disclosure) of Jessie’s personal data may have been in breach of the Data
Protection Provisions. In this case, Organisation XYZ should cease any further use or
disclosure of Jessie’s personal data. Where the purpose for which the personal data
was collected is no longer being served by the retention and retention is no longer
necessary for legal or business purposes, Organisation XYZ should also cease such
retention13.

13

To be clear, Organisation XYZ’s ceasing to retain Jessie’s personal data does not necessarily absolve
Organisation XYZ of any breach of the Data Protection Provisions, nor preclude the Commission from taking
action against Organisation XYZ if the Commission determines that Organisation XYZ had indeed breached the
Data Protection Provisions.

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Does the PDPA affect the copyright in a photograph or video recording?
4.32

The Data Protection Provisions do not affect any right conferred or obligation
imposed by or under other laws, including the Copyright Act. In particular, the PDPA
does not affect copyright subsisting in a photograph, video recording or other item
in respect of which copyright is protected under the Copyright Act (“copyright item”).
Hence, organisations which collect, use or disclose personal data in a copyright item
must comply with the Data Protection Provisions in respect of that personal data,
except to the extent of any inconsistency between the Data Protection Provisions
and other written law. For example, an organisation that seeks to take a photograph
or video recording of an individual would need to comply with the Notification
Obligation and Consent Obligation, unless an exception under the PDPA applies (as
discussed above).
Closed-Circuit Television Cameras (“CCTVs”)

4.33

CCTVs are commonly used to capture video recordings, and some of them may also
be equipped with audio recording capabilities. The paragraphs below pertain to the
use of CCTVs, and generally apply regardless of whether the CCTVs record video only
or both video and audio.
Do organisations always have to provide notifications when CCTVs are deployed?

4.34

The PDPA requires organisations to inform individuals of the purposes for which their
personal data will be collected, used or disclosed in order to obtain their consent.
Organisations should thus provide notifications in order to fulfil their obligation to
obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of CCTV footage. Please see the
sections on the “Consent Obligation” and “Notification Obligation” in the Key
Concepts Guidelines for more details.

4.35

However, where consent is not required (e.g. if the collection, use or disclosure falls
within an exception in the Second, Third or Fourth Schedules respectively), the PDPA
does not require organisations to provide notification (except for collection, use or
disclosure for the purpose of managing or terminating the employment relationship
between the individual and the organisation, which requires notification). Where
notification is not required, organisations may still wish to provide notifications in
such instances as good practice.
Where should notices be placed?

4.36

Notices or other forms of notifications should generally be placed so as to enable
individuals to have sufficient awareness that CCTVs have been deployed for a
particular purpose. For example, it may be appropriate to place a notice at points of
32

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

entry to a building or prominent locations in a venue or a vehicle, where individuals
are able to read the notice prior to collection of their personal data.
What should such notices state?
4.37

The PDPA does not prescribe the content of notifications. To be clear, the notice
should not just contain an image or graphic of a CCTV. Generally, organisations
should indicate that CCTVs are operating in the premises, and state the purpose of
the CCTVs (e.g. the CCTVs are installed for security purposes) if such purpose may
not be obvious to the individual. Further, where CCTVs deployed record both video
and audio, organisations should indicate that both video and audio recordings are
taking place.
Is notification still required if CCTVs are there to covertly monitor the premises for
security reasons, and notification of the CCTV’s location would defeat the purpose
of using the CCTVs?

4.38

4.39

The Commission does not require the placement or content of notifications to reveal
the exact location of the CCTVs. Organisations may provide notice that CCTVs are
deployed in the general locale instead of indicating the specific points where the
CCTVs are installed. Where personal data may be collected without consent and
notification of purposes will not be required by the PDPA (e.g. where the personal
data is publicly available14), organisations are nevertheless advised to provide
notification as good practice.
Example:
Organisation XYZ deploys CCTVs for security purposes at the entrance to its office
premises. It provides a notification at the entrance to its office which clearly and
prominently states the use and purpose of video surveillance. Such notification
would be considered sufficient for Organisation XYZ’s purpose.
If my organisation installs CCTVs that also capture footage beyond the boundaries of
our premises, is that allowed?

4.40

The PDPA requires that an organisation consider what a reasonable person would
consider appropriate under the circumstances in meeting its obligations under the
PDPA. An organisation is not prohibited by the PDPA from having CCTVs that collect
footage beyond the boundaries of its premises. Organisations should, however,

14

Please refer to Chapter 12 of the Key Concepts Guidelines for more information on the concept of “publicly
available”.
33

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

consider the extent of coverage that is reasonable for the purpose of installing the
CCTVs. Organisations should put in place appropriate notification in all areas where
personal data would be collected by the CCTV, and obtain consent for such
collection, as well as any use and disclosure of personal data unless consent is not
required because one of the exceptions in the respective Second, Third or Fourth
Schedule of the PDPA applies.
4.41

However, the organisation should bear in mind that there may be other
considerations that may affect its ability to collect CCTV footage of areas beyond its
premises (e.g. limits on filming of restricted areas).
Is an organisation required to provide access to CCTV footage if it also reveals the
personal data of other individuals?

4.42

Generally, an organisation is required to provide the individual access to personal
data requested, unless the request falls within one of the prohibitions under section
21(3) of the PDPA or any exception under the Fifth Schedule.

4.43

For example, one of the prohibitions in section 21(3)(c) is in respect of providing
access to an individual’s personal data or other information if that provision could
reasonably be expected to reveal personal data about another individual. However,
the Commission is of the view that this prohibition would not apply in circumstances
where:

4.44

a)

the other individual has given consent to the disclosure of his personal data;
or

b)

any of the exceptions under the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA apply to the
extent that the organisation may disclose personal data of the other
individual without consent (e.g. the personal data of the other individual is
publicly available); or

c)

the organisation is able to provide the individual access to the requested
personal data without revealing the personal data of the other individual.
For example, the organisation should consider if it is able to mask out the
personal data of the other individual in order to provide access to the
requested personal data.

Please refer to Chapter 15 of the Key Concepts Guidelines for more information on
the Access Obligation.

34

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Must an organisation provide access to CCTV footage if it doesn’t have the technical
ability or it is too costly to mask the other individuals whose personal data are
captured in the footage?
4.45

Generally, an organisation is required to provide for access requests. In the case of
CCTV footage, this would include being able to provide access to CCTV footage where
the personal data of other individuals present in the CCTV footage are masked as
required (e.g. where consent of the individuals for such disclosure is required, but
has not been obtained).

4.46

The organisation may charge an individual a reasonable fee to recover any
incremental costs of responding to the access request15. The organisation should
provide access to the CCTV footage with the personal data of other individuals in the
same footage masked as required, so long as the applicant agrees to pay the fee for
the organisation to respond to the access request, unless a relevant exception or
prohibition applies.

4.47

For example, organisations are not required to provide access if the request is
frivolous or vexatious, or if the burden or expense of providing access would be
unreasonable to the organisation or disproportionate to the individual’s interest. If
an organisation intends to rely on this or other exceptions from the requirement to
provide access provided for in the Fifth Schedule, it should be able to provide
supporting evidence to justify its decision.
Is an organisation required to provide a copy of CCTV footage pursuant to an access
request for the footage?

4.48

Organisations should provide a copy of the CCTV footage and have the option of
charging the individual a reasonable fee for providing the copy.

4.49

If the CCTV footage resides in a form that cannot be provided to the individual in
physical or electronic copies, (e.g. the data cannot be extracted from a special
machine owned by the organisation), or if it is prohibitively costly to provide the
footage in the aforementioned formats, then the organisation may provide the
individual a reasonable opportunity to examine the requested data in person, with
appropriate masking of the personal data of other individuals where required.

15

If an organisation wishes to charge an access fee, the organisation must give the individual a written estimate
of the fee. If the organisation wishes to charge a fee higher than the original written estimate, it must inform
the individual in writing of the increased fee. The organisation may refuse to provide access to the individual’s
personal data until the individual agrees to pay the relevant fee.
35

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Can compromising an organisation’s security arrangements or competitive position
be sufficient reason to deny access to CCTV footage?
4.50

The Commission’s view is that, depending on the specific facts and circumstances,
compromising an organisation’s security arrangements or harming an organisation’s
competitive position could be a sufficient basis to deny access to CCTV footage if
there is an applicable exception in the Fifth Schedule or prohibition in providing
access in section 21. An example would be where the provision of the personal data
in the CCTV footage could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety of another
individual. However, where an organisation denies access on this basis, the
Commission expects the organisation to be able to provide strong justifications as to
why it is unable to accede to the access request. The Commission will have to make
a determination based on the facts of the particular case, should a complaint be
received.
Can two or more individuals make an access request for the same CCTV footage
containing their personal data, if they consent to their own personal data being
revealed to the others making the access request?

4.51

Yes. It would be reasonable for certain groups of individuals (e.g. a married couple,
parents of a class of students etc.) to make an access request for the same footage
containing their personal data. Organisations may apply the same considerations in
determining whether to provide access as they would for a request made by a single
individual. Organisations may provide access without masking out the other
individuals in the footage if the other individuals have given consent to the disclosure
of their personal data16. Please refer to Chapter 15 of the Key Concepts Guidelines.
Is an organisation required to accede to requests to delete CCTV footage?

4.52

No. The PDPA does not require an organisation to delete personal data upon request
from an individual. Section 25 of the PDPA requires an organisation to cease to retain
its documents containing personal data, or remove the means by which the personal
data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to
assume that the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer
being served by retention of the personal data, and retention is no longer necessary
for legal or business purposes.

4.53

Nonetheless, individuals may at any time, upon giving reasonable notice, withdraw
any consent given or deemed to have been given under the PDPA in respect of the
collection, use or disclosure of their personal data for any purpose by an

16

Organisations should consider if any other prohibitions may also apply with respect to providing access to
personal data requested.
36

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

organisation. Section 16 of the PDPA sets out a number of requirements that the
organisation must comply with in relation to a withdrawal of consent. This does not
affect any legal consequences arising from a withdrawal of consent. Please refer to
Chapter 12 of the Key Concepts Guidelines for more information on withdrawal of
consent.
Is there a requirement that CCTV footage or video stills be of minimum resolution
when provided to individuals upon request?
4.54

The PDPA does not prescribe any minimum resolution. However, given that the
requirement is for the organisation to provide the personal data in its possession or
under its control, the organisation should provide the CCTV footage in the form and
of the resolution it holds for its purposes.
Can the organisation require that the individual sign a contract to agree not to
disclose to any third party the CCTV footage to be provided to him?

4.55

The PDPA does not prohibit this. However, such a contract would not override any
rights or obligations under the PDPA. Organisations should also note that individuals
acting in a personal or domestic capacity are not subject to the Data Protection
Provisions of the PDPA.
Where an organisation is providing a copy of the CCTV footage upon request of an
individual, must the copy be a video or can it be provided in other formats?

4.56

The PDPA does not specify the format of the personal data to be provided in relation
to an access request made by an individual. In the case of personal data captured in
CCTV footage, organisations may respond to access requests for CCTV footage by
providing either still frames of the footage or the actual footage itself, with
appropriate masking of the personal data of other individuals, unless a relevant
exception under section 21 applies.
What does “video masking” or “masking” refer to?

4.57

“Video masking” of images refers to the process of concealing parts of the video from
view. This may include masking certain body parts or inanimate objects that could
potentially disclose the personal data of an individual. The common types of masking
include (i) solid colour masked areas; (ii) blurred masking; or (iii) pixelated masking.
Where solid colour masking is used, no details or movement in the scene covered by
the masked area can be viewed. However, when pixelated or blurred masking is
used, the resulting image enables a partial outline to be seen but with detailed
features obscured. This may be a less foolproof method as it is possible for pixelated
or blurred images of individuals to still be identifiable. Examples of the different
37

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

masking techniques are shown below. These can be applied to both video and still
imagery.
Solid

Blur

Pixelated

Drones
4.58

Increasingly, organisations are making use of drones that may be equipped with
photography, video and/or audio recording capabilities. The subsequent paragraphs
pertain to the use of drones by organisations, and generally apply regardless of
whether the drones are equipped with photography, video and/or audio recording
capabilities. To be clear, the Data Protection Provisions do not impose any obligation
on an individual acting in his personal or domestic capacity.
What should organisations consider when using drones?

4.59

Organisations will need to consider whether the drones they deploy are likely to
capture personal data of individuals, and may wish to evaluate whether any
exception under the PDPA applies in respect of its particular circumstances.

4.60

The use of drones with photography, video and/or audio recording capabilities are
generally subject to the same considerations and obligations under the PDPA as that
of other equipment with similar capabilities. Organisations should also be mindful
that the operation of drones is subject to the guidelines and requirements of other
authorities. For instance, organisations should not operate a drone within the
boundaries of any prohibited area (i.e. protected area or special event area) 17.
Enquiries may be made to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.
What should organisations do if the drones used are likely to capture personal data?

4.61

17

Among other obligations, the Data Protection Provisions require organisations to
inform individuals of the purposes for which their personal data will be collected,

See Division 4 of the Air Navigation Act (Cap 6) and Part III of the Public Order Act (Cap 257A).
38

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

used and disclosed in order to obtain their consent. An organisation must thus
provide notification of the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure of personal
data captured by its drones, in order to fulfil the obligation to obtain consent18. The
notifications should specify if photography, video and/or audio recording is taking
place and should generally be placed so as to enable individuals to have sufficient
awareness that drones are in operation in the general locale. For example, it may be
appropriate to place a notice at points of entry to the area of operation, where
individuals are able to read the notice prior to entry.
4.62

The PDPA sets out various exceptions to the Consent Obligation. In particular, there
is an exception for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data that is publicly
available19. For example, when the individual appears at an event or location that is
open to the public, a photograph, video or audio recording taken of the individual at
such an event or location would likely be personal data that is publicly available, and
organisations may collect, use or disclose such personal data without consent. In
such instances, organisations may still wish to provide notifications as good practice.
Some possible methods of providing notification include placing signages at
entrances to the spaces where the drone is flown, at prominent locations along the
approved flight path (or carried/worn by safety marshals), or at the launch site, etc.
Please refer to the Key Concepts Guidelines for more details on the Consent
Obligation, Notification Obligation and publicly available exception.
What should organisations do if personal data was unintentionally collected by the
drones?

4.63

The Commission would encourage organisations to ensure that they adhere to the
pre-determined flight path of drones and adopt policies restricting or prohibiting the
use of any personal data that is unintentionally collected (e.g. when drones
accidentally veer off-course from the pre-determined flight path and collect personal
data without consent)20.

18

Where a drone operator is capturing photographs, video and/or audio recordings on behalf of and for the
purposes of another organisation pursuant to a contract in writing, the other organisation is required to comply
with the Data Protection Provisions. If the drone operator is an employee acting in the course of his employment
with an organisation, he will not be required to comply with the Data Protection Provisions, instead his employer
will be required to comply.
19

Under the PDPA, “publicly available”, in relation to personal data about an individual, means personal data
that is generally available to the public, and includes personal data which can be observed by reasonably
expected means at a location or an event at which the individual appears and that is open to the public.
20

To be clear, the deletion of the personal data does not necessarily absolve an organisation of any breach of
the Data Protection Provisions, nor preclude the Commission from taking action against the organisation if the
Commission determines that the organisation had indeed breached the Data Protection Provisions.
39

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Employment
Does an organisation need to seek the consent of a job applicant for the collection
and use of his personal data?

5.1

Organisations may receive personal data from job applicants who provide it
voluntarily through a job application, either in response to a recruitment
advertisement or otherwise.

5.2

When an individual voluntarily provides his personal data to an organisation in the
form of a job application, he may be deemed to consent to the organisation
collecting, using and disclosing the personal data for the purpose of assessing his job
application. If the individual is subsequently employed, it would be reasonable for
the organisation to continue to use the personal data provided by the individual in
the job application form for the purpose of managing the employment relationship
with the individual, if required. If the organisation wishes to use the personal data
for purposes for which consent may not be deemed or to which there is no applicable
exception under the PDPA, the organisation must then inform the individual of those
purposes and obtain his consent, unless relevant exceptions apply. Please see the
section on The Consent Obligation in the Key Concepts Guidelines for more details.
Can organisations collect and use personal data on the job applicant from social
networking sources (e.g. Facebook or Twitter)?

5.3

The PDPA does not require organisations to obtain the consent of the individual
when collecting personal data that is publicly available. Examples of publicly
available sources are newspapers, telephone directories and websites containing
content which is generally available to the public. Where social networking sources
are publicly available, the PDPA does not prohibit organisations from collecting
personal data about the individual without his consent. Please refer to the section
on “The Consent Obligation” in the Key Concepts Guidelines for more explanation of
the ‘publicly available data’ exception.
Can organisations or recruitment agencies collect and use personal data on
individuals from social networking sites or publicly available sources to contact them
for prospective job opportunities?

5.4

The PDPA does not require organisations to obtain the consent of the individual
when collecting or using personal data that is publicly available. Where the personal
data is not publicly available, but is voluntarily made available by the individual on a
job-search portal for being contacted for prospective job opportunities, the
individual may be deemed to have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of
his personal data for such purpose.
40

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Can organisations use the information in business cards for recruitment?
5.5

The Data Protection Provisions in the PDPA do not apply to “business contact
information”, which is defined in the PDPA as:
“an individual’s name, position name or title, business telephone number, business
address, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other
similar information about the individual, not provided by the individual solely for his
personal purposes”.

5.6

5.7

If the individual provided his business card for purposes other than solely for
personal purposes, then the organisation is not required to comply with the Data
Protection Provisions of the PDPA in respect of the contact information set out in the
business card.
Example:
At the registration booth of a corporate seminar, Sharon drops her business name
card into a glass bowl by the side of the registration booth as she wishes to be on
the seminar organiser’s mailing list for future invitations to similar seminars.
Sharon’s business name card contains her name, position, business telephone
number, business address, business electronic mail address and business fax
number. As Sharon did not provide her business name card solely for personal
purposes, the information on it will be considered business contact information.
The PDPA does not apply and the seminar organiser does not need to seek Sharon’s
consent to use the information on her business name card.
How long can an organisation keep the personal data of job applicants who are not
hired?

5.8

After an organisation has decided which job applicant to hire, the personal data that
the organisation had collected from the other job applicants should only be kept for
as long as it is necessary for business or legal purposes. Organisations should note
that job applicants have the right to obtain access and request corrections to their
personal data held by the organisation. Please see the section on “The Access and
Correction Obligation” in the Key Concepts Guidelines for more details.
Can job applicants ask the organisation to reveal how much information the
organisation has on them or find out why they were not selected?

5.9

Under the PDPA, individuals have the right to obtain access and request corrections
to their personal data held by organisations. Upon request, the organisation must
also inform the individual of the ways in which the personal data had been used for
41

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

the past year. Thus, organisations must reveal to the job applicant who requests so,
the personal data the organisation has on them. There are however exceptions to
this obligation to provide access to personal data, including several mandatory
exceptions. Please refer to the section on “The Access and Correction Obligation” in
the Key Concepts Guidelines for more details.
5.10

For example, if the personal data in question is opinion data kept solely for an
evaluative purpose, organisations are not required to provide the requested
information to the individual. This means that organisations will not need to inform
a job applicant of the opinions which were formed about him in the course of
determining his suitability and eligibility for the job.
How does the PDPA apply to recruitment agencies?

5.11

Recruitment companies, employment agencies, head-hunters and other similar
organisations (henceforth ‘recruitment agencies’) are subject to the Data Protection
Provisions of the PDPA. Accordingly, unless an exception under the PDPA applies,
recruitment agencies will have to inform job applicants of the purposes for which
they are collecting using or disclosing their personal data, and obtain consent before
doing so.

5.12

Recruitment agencies that are acting as data intermediaries are required to comply
with fewer obligations under the PDPA. The PDPA provides that a data intermediary
that processes personal data on behalf of and for the purposes of another
organisation pursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in writing will only
be subject to the provisions in the PDPA relating to the safeguarding and retention
of personal data in respect of such processing. In certain circumstances these
recruitment agencies could qualify as data intermediaries. For more information on
data intermediaries, please refer to the section on “Excluded Organisations” in the
Key Concepts Guidelines.

5.13

Recruitment agencies should also note that a message sent solely to promote an
employment opportunity would not be regarded as a specified message and would
not be subject to the Do Not Call Provisions. Please refer to the section on the “Do
Not Call Provisions” in the Key Concepts Guidelines for more information.
Personal Data of Employees
How does the PDPA apply to employment records of employees?

5.14

Most organisations maintain some form of employment records on their current
employees, which may include contact information, resumes, performance
indicators and remuneration histories. Organisations should inform the employees
42

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of their personal data and
obtain their consent prior to the collection, use and disclosure (as the case may be).
5.15

In many cases, consent could be obtained at the point of appointing the new
employee. It may, however, also be necessary to obtain consent at various points
during the employment relationship when the organisation requires more personal
data or intends to use or disclose the employee’s personal data for other purposes.
Please also note that even if consent is given, employees may withdraw that consent
under the PDPA.

5.16

Employers should also note that even if an exception applies such that consent need
not be sought, the exception does not affect rights or obligations arising under any
other law. Hence, even if an exception applies under the PDPA, employers are
required to comply with their other legal obligations, for example, to protect
confidential information of their employees or under the employment contract.
Collecting, using and disclosing employee personal data for evaluative purposes

5.17

Organisations may collect, use and disclose personal data without consent where
this is necessary for evaluative purposes. (This is set out as exception 1(f) in the
Second Schedule, 1(f) in the Third Schedule and 1(h) in the Fourth Schedule
respectively). The term “evaluative purpose” is defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA
and includes, amongst other things, the purpose of determining the suitability,
eligibility or qualifications of an individual for employment, promotion in
employment or continuance in employment.

5.18

Hence, the evaluative purpose exception allows employers to collect, use and
disclose personal data without the consent of the individual or employee concerned
for various purposes that are common in the employment context, for example:
a)

Obtaining a reference from a prospective employee’s former employer to
determine his suitability for employment; or

b)

Obtaining performance records or other relevant information or opinions to
determine the performance of an employee.

Collecting, using and disclosing personal data for the purpose of managing or
terminating an employment relationship between the organisation and the
individual
5.19

Under the PDPA, the collection by organisations of personal data from their
employees that is reasonable for the purpose of managing or terminating their
employment relationships, and the use or disclosure of such personal data for
consistent purposes would not require the consent of their employees. This is
43

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

pursuant to exception 1(o) in the Second Schedule, 1(j) in the Third Schedule and 1(s)
in the Fourth Schedule respectively. While consent is not required, employers are
required to notify their employees of the purposes of such collection, use or
disclosure.
5.20

The PDPA does not prescribe the manner of notification and organisations should
determine the form and manner that would provide the individual with the required
information that allows him to understand the purposes for which his personal data
would be collected, used and disclosed. For example, organisations may determine
in the particular circumstances if it would be appropriate to inform their employees
of these purposes through employment contracts, employee handbooks, or notices
in the company intranet. Organisations should also keep their employees updated
about new purposes for which an employee’s personal data may be collected, used
and disclosed without consent. For the avoidance of doubt, where an organisation
has sufficiently provided a general notification to employees on the purposes for
which their personal data may be collected, used and disclosed, for example for
performance appraisals, the Commission does not expect organisations to notify
employees of the same purpose prior to each time that the organisation engages in
such activities. Please refer to the section on “The Notification Obligation” in the Key
Concepts Guidelines for more details.

5.21

Purposes that could fall within the purpose of managing or terminating an
employment relationship can include:

5.22

a)

Using the employee’s bank account details to issue salaries;

b)

Monitoring how the employee uses company computer network resources;

c)

Posting employees’ photographs on the staff directory page on the
company intranet; and

d)

Managing staff benefit schemes like training or educational subsidies.

Employers would need to seek consent for purposes that are not related to, or the
collection of personal data that is not relevant to the management or termination of
an employment relationship (unless any other exception under the PDPA applies). In
particular, employers would need to obtain consent when collecting, using or
disclosing employee personal data for business or client purposes not related to
managing or terminating an employment relationship.

44

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

5.23

Example:
Organisation ABC engages a courier company to deliver a parcel to organisation XYZ.
XYZ requires the full name and NRIC number (personal data) of the employee which
will be dispatched by the courier for this delivery for the purposes of allowing the
courier to enter XYZ’s office premises. Before disclosing the personal data of its
employee, the courier company should obtain the employee’s consent to do so.
Such consent can be obtained on a case by case basis, or once-off through the
employment contract or other appropriate means.
What is the difference between the exception for evaluative purposes and the
exception for the purpose of managing and terminating an employment
relationship?

5.24

5.25

There are instances where employers have to collect the same set of personal data
for both the purposes of (i) managing or terminating the employment relationship
and (ii) evaluation. The difference between the two purposes lies in the requirement
to notify individuals for purpose (i) but not for purpose (ii). In other words,
employers need only inform employees of the purpose for managing and terminating
the employment relationship, and not of the evaluative purpose.
Example:
An employer collects information about the projects an employee has worked on to
determine whether to promote him (an evaluative purpose), and to conduct audits
on his finance claims (a purpose for managing and terminating an employment
relationship).
The employer need only notify the employee that his personal data is being
collected for audit purposes. The employer does not need to obtain consent from
the employee for the collection of his personal data or inform him that he is being
evaluated for promotion to a higher job grade.

5.26

Employers should note that even though some exceptions in the PDPA can apply in
the employment context, organisations should still act based on what a reasonable
person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. Please see the section on
“Reasonableness” in the Key Concepts Guidelines.

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

How long can organisations continue to hold personal data of former employees?
5.27

Section 25 of the PDPA requires an organisation to cease to retain its documents
containing personal data, or remove the means by which the personal data can be
associated with particular individuals, as soon as the purpose for which that personal
data was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal data, and
retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes. The Retention
Limitation Obligation does not specify a fixed duration of time for which an
organisation can retain personal data as each organisation has its own specific
business needs.

5.28

Organisations may continue to retain personal data about the former employee that
was collected during his employment period for as long as there is a valid business
or legal purpose. For example, organisations that have a policy of retaining personal
data of former employees for the purpose of considering them for future job
opportunities can continue to do so as a valid business purpose. However,
organisations should not retain personal data without a clearly defined purpose.
Organisations should note that holding personal data for an indeterminate duration
of time increases the risk of a contravention of the Data Protection Provisions, as
organisations have other obligations in relation to the personal data held. Please see
the section on the “Retention Limitation Obligation” in the Key Concepts Guidelines
for more information.
Are organisations responsible if their employees do not comply with the PDPA? Are
volunteers considered employees?

5.29

Under the PDPA, an organisation is responsible for the personal data in its possession
or under its control, including for any breaches of the PDPA caused by their
employees acting in the course of their employment. In particular, any act done or
conduct engaged in by an employee in the course of his employment shall be treated
as done or engaged in by his employer, whether or not it was done or engaged in
with the employer’s knowledge or approval.

5.30

In relation to offences under the PDPA by an employee of an organisation, the
organisation will not be liable if it took such steps as were practicable to prevent the
employee from doing the act or engaging in the conduct that constitutes the offence.
Organisations should develop and implement policies and practices that comply with
the PDPA, and communicate such policies and practices to their employees.

5.31

Organisations should note that the PDPA defines “employee” to include a volunteer,
and “employment” to include working under an unpaid volunteer work relationship.

46

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Do the exceptions to the Consent Obligation for the collection, use and disclosure of
personal data of employees also apply to individuals that may act on behalf of an
organisation, but are not the organisation’s employees?
5.32

The exception relating to “managing or terminating an employment relationship”
only apply when there is an employment relationship. Where an organisation is
collecting the personal data of individuals that are not its employees for a specific
purpose, this specific exception would not apply. However, other exceptions may
apply, for example where the organisation is required under written law to collect
personal data of such individuals in order to assess whether the qualifications of such
individuals comply with regulatory requirements.

Online Activities
Are IP addresses personal data?

6.1

IP addresses of networked devices are automatically captured whenever a
connection is made over the Internet. An IP address, or any other network identifier
such as an IMEI number, may not be personal data when viewed in isolation, because
it simply identifies a networked device. However, IP addresses have the potential of
identifying unique individuals through their activities, especially when combined
with traces of information that individuals leave on these networked devices as they
interact with the Internet. Depending on how a device is used, the traces of
information are collected and the presence of other available information affects the
possibility of identifying an individual from his device’s IP address.

6.2

For instance, a shared computer may be used by several individuals in an office or
home with the same login account and it is therefore unlikely for the IP address to
be connected to a single individual. However, if each individual has separate login
accounts, then the online activities will relate to that login identity. Along with other
information such as cookies (addressed below), IP addresses can identify individuals,
and are likely to be personal data in such context.

6.3

The Commission notes that organisations do engage in the collection of data points
tied to an IP address for various purposes. For example, such purposes could include
determining the number of unique visitors to a website in a month, or the number
of unique responses to a once-off online survey about consumer preferences,
organisations may track activities tied to an IP address. Such tracking may not result
in the collection of personal data, if the organisation is unable to identify an
individual from the data collected or from that data and other information that the
organisation has or is likely to have access. However, organisations should note that
the more data points associated to a unique IP address an organisation collects, the
more likely that the data may be personal data. For example, if an organisation
profiles the websites visited by an IP address, the items purchased by the same IP
address and other online activities associated to the IP address for a long period of
time, and is able to ascertain that the particular IP address is associated with a unique
person with a specific surfing profile, the organisation may be found to have
collected personal data.

6.4

For more details on what constitutes personal data is, please refer to the section on
“personal data” in the Key Concepts Guidelines.

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Must consent be obtained for the use of cookies?
6.5

Cookies are text files created on a client computer when its web browser loads a
website or web application. Often encrypted for protection against unauthorised
access, they are used to store information for performing certain functions such as
completing forms, facilitating website navigation, authentication, and enabling
advertising technology. Depending on the purpose(s) for which they are used, the
durations which cookies are stored differ. Session cookies typically expire at the end
of a browser session, while persistent cookies can be stored for some duration in a
browser folder until they are deleted, either manually, or upon browser exit. Also
depending on the purpose of the cookies is the type of information that they store.
The PDPA applies to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal data using cookies.

6.6

Many Internet activities today are dependent on the use of cookies, such that
unnecessarily restricting the use of cookies will impede the usability of the Internet.
However, because cookies can potentially collect personal data, organisations should
be mindful of the concern surrounding the use of cookies for individuals’ online
activities. It is thus important to strike a balanced approach on the need for consent
in the use of cookies.

6.7

First, not all cookies collect personal data. For example, session cookies may only
collect and store technical data needed to play back a video on a website. Consent
is not needed for cookies that do not collect personal data.

6.8

Second, for Internet activities that the user has clearly requested, there may not be
a need to seek consent for the use of cookies to collect, use, and disclose personal
data where the individual is aware of the purposes for such collection, use or
disclosure and voluntarily provided his personal data for such purposes. Such
activities include (but are not limited to) transmitting personal data for effecting
online communications and storing information that the user enters in a web form
to facilitate an online purchase. For activities that cannot take place without cookies
that collect, use or disclose personal data, consent may be deemed if the individual
voluntarily provides the personal data for that purpose of the activity, and it is
reasonable that he would do so. Please refer to the section on “The Consent
Obligation – Deemed Consent” in the Key Concepts Guidelines for more details.

6.9

Consent may also be reflected in the way a user configures his interaction with the
Internet. If the individual configures his browser to accept certain cookies but rejects
others, he may be found to have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of
his personal data by the cookies that he has chosen to accept. For example, if the
individual has configured his browser settings to reject all cookies except those from
his online banking website and his email websites, it is clear that he has consented

49

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

to the collection, use and disclosure of his personal data by his banking and email
websites for their stated purposes, but not other websites. However, the mere
failure of an individual to actively manage his browser settings does not imply that
the individual has consented to the collection, use and disclosure of his personal data
by all websites for their stated purpose.
6.10

For avoidance of doubt, the obligation to obtain the individual’s consent for the
collection of his personal data rests with the organisation that is collecting such
personal data, whether by itself or through its data intermediaries. Where an
organisation operates a website which a third party uses to collect personal data,
and the website operator itself is not collecting such personal data, the obligation is
on the third party organisation to obtain the consent required to collect such
personal data.
Are organisations allowed to use cookies for behavioural targeting?

6.11

Where behavioural targeting involves the collection and use of personal data, the
individual’s consent is required.

Data Activities Relating to Minors
When can a minor give valid consent on his own behalf under the PDPA?

7.1

The PDPA does not specify the situations in which a minor (that is, an individual who
is less than 21 years of age) may give consent for the purposes of the PDPA. In
general, whether a minor can give such consent would depend on other legislation
and the common law. In this regard, organisations should keep in mind that Parts III
to VI of the PDPA do not affect any legal rights or obligations under other laws 21.

7.2

It is noted that the ages at which minors may conduct different types of activities on
their own or are accorded certain legal protections vary across various local
legislation22.

7.3

For situations where there is no legislation that affects whether a minor may give
consent, the issue would be governed by the common law. In this regard, the
Commission notes that there is no international norm on when minors may exercise
their own rights under data protection laws. The Commission understands that in
some countries, some kind of test of maturity is applied, taking into account factors
such as the level of maturity of the minor, the minor’s capacity to understand the
nature of legal rights and whether there is any undue influence exerted on the minor,
to determine if a minor can exercise legal rights. In addition, some countries have
enacted legislation to specifically protect minors below a certain age. For example,
in the United States, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires
certain organisations to obtain verifiable parental consent to collect personal data
from children under 13 years of age23.

21

Section 4(6)(a) of the PDPA.

22

Provisions that set out age thresholds for the purpose of according certain legal protections to minors include:

a)
section 35(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43) which provides that, except as otherwise provided in that
section or any other written law, a contract entered into by a minor who has attained the age of 18 years has
effect as if he was of full age (that is, 21 years of age);
b)
section 67A of the Employment Act (Cap. 91), which defines a child as one below 15 years of age and
a young person as one between 15 and 16 years of age for the purposes of according varying protections in
respect of the different age groups; and
c)
section 2 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap. 38), which defines a child as one who is below 14
years of age and a young person as one that is between 14 and 16 years of age for purposes of according varying
protections under that Act.

51

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

7.4

The Commission understands that the applicable test under English common law for
when a minor can consent on his own behalf in matters relating to medical treatment
(and several other areas)24 would be the Gillick test. In brief, the Gillick test sets out
that a minor may provide consent if he has sufficient understanding and intelligence
to enable him to understand fully what is proposed. To-date, the Gillick test has not
yet been expressly approved by a Singapore court25.

7.5

The Commission notes that the age threshold of 13 years appears to be a significant
one in relation to according protection to minors. For example, under the
Employment Act, a child 13 years of age or older may be employed in light work
suited to his capacity in a non-industrial undertaking and no child who is below the
age of 13 years shall be employed in any occupation (with a limited exception)26.
Similarly, some film and video classification ratings set out age thresholds for
audiences for such content, including Parental Guidance 13 (“PG13”)27. In addition,
organisations that face exposure to COPPA (e.g. companies that provide online
services to individuals in the US) may also already have policies and procedures that
are premised on the age threshold of 13 years in relation to consent to the collection,
use and disclosure of their personal data.

7.6

The Commission is of the view that organisations should generally consider whether
a minor has sufficient understanding of the nature and consequences of giving
consent, in determining if he can effectively provide consent on his own behalf for
purposes of the PDPA. It is also noted that, as a practical matter, some organisations
may already have policies or practices providing for an age threshold of 13 years in
relation to consent. Bearing this in mind, the Commission will adopt the practical
rule of thumb that a minor who is at least 13 years of age would typically have

24

While the holding in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority [1986] AC 112 may be argued
to only apply narrowly in the context of consenting to medical treatment and advice, later UK cases have applied
the Gillick principle to other areas. For instance, it was applied in determining if a minor was able to make a
decision on divulging information about herself to the press. The Commission is however not aware of any UK
cases which expressly applies the Gillick principle in the context of UK’s data protection laws and in particular,
in determining whether a minor can consent to the sharing of his personal data.
25

To-date, there are no Singapore cases that have expressly applied Gillick, whether in the context of a minor
consenting to receiving medical treatment, or in any other context. It therefore remains an open question
whether or not the Singapore court will find the GIllick principle to have any relevance in determining whether
a minor can exercise his legal rights, especially in the context of Singapore’s own data protection framework.
26

Please see section 68(3) of the Employment Act and Regulation 3 of the Employment (Children and Young
Persons) Regulations.
27

PG13 is an advisory rating that means “suitable for persons aged 13 and above but parental guidance is
advised for children below 13”. More details of the film and video classification system are available at:
http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/FilmsAndVideos/Pages/
default.aspx.
52

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

sufficient understanding to be able to consent on his own behalf. However, where,
for example, an organisation has reason to believe or it can be shown that a minor
does not have sufficient understanding of the nature and consequences of giving
consent, the organisation should obtain consent from an individual, such as the
minor’s parent or guardian, who is legally able to provide consent on the minor’s
behalf.28
7.7

Overall, an organisation should take appropriate steps to ensure that the minor can
effectively give consent on his own behalf, in light of the circumstances of the
particular case including the impact on the minor in giving consent.
Can a minor’s parents or other legal guardians provide valid consent on behalf of the
minor under the PDPA?

7.8

Section 14(4) of the PDPA provides that consent given or deemed to have been given
by an individual for the collection, use or disclosure of the individual’s personal data
includes consent given or deemed to have been given by any person validly acting
on behalf of that individual for the collection, use or disclosure of such personal data.
In situations where a minor does not have the requisite legal capacity to give consent
for purposes of the PDPA, the minor’s parents or other legal guardians may give
consent on behalf of the minor. In general, the rights of parents in respect of their
children are derived from the common law but there may be legislation that affects
how and if they may exercise such rights29.

7.9

Where an organisation requires the consent of a minor for the collection, use or
disclosure of his personal data, the organisation should consider whether it would
be appropriate for the organisation to obtain consent given on behalf of the minor
from an individual who can legally give consent on behalf of the minor. As a general
guide, where the minor is under the age of 13 years, organisations may wish to obtain
consent for the collection, use and disclosure of the minor’s personal data from an
individual that can legally give consent on behalf of the minor, such as the minor’s
parent or guardian.
When is a minor deemed to have given consent on his own behalf under the PDPA?

7.10

Under section 15(1) of the PDPA, an individual may be deemed to have consented to

28

For avoidance of doubt, the Commission’s position does not affect any right of a parent or legal guardian of a
minor to exercise any right or power conferred on the minor under the PDPA on behalf of the minor. Thus, if a
parent or legal guardian is empowered to provide consent or refusal on behalf of a minor, an organisation should
generally rely on such consent or refusal given by the parent or legal guardian.
29

For example, Singapore legislation such as the Guardianship of Infants Act and Women’s Charter may affect
whether an individual has custody over a minor.
53

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for a purpose if he voluntarily
provides his personal data for that purpose (without actually giving consent) and it
is reasonable that the individual would voluntarily provide the data. In the case of a
minor, the Commission is of the view that whether a minor provides his personal
data for a purpose voluntarily would depend on various factors including the
following:

7.11

a)

the minor’s understanding of the purpose for which his personal data is
provided;

b)

the minor’s understanding of the effect of giving his personal data for that
purpose; and

c)

whether there was any undue influence on the minor with respect to the
provision of his personal data.

As noted in the preceding section, the Commission will, as a general guide, take the
view that a minor who is at least 13 years of age would typically have sufficient
understanding to be able to consent on his own behalf. This will similarly apply to
deemed consent. In view of the potential difficulties of establishing whether
deemed consent applies, the Commission is of the view that organisations that wish
to rely on deemed consent in certain situations should take extra care to establish
whether a minor has sufficient understanding of the purposes for which the
organisation is collecting, using and disclosing personal data and the consequences
of giving his personal data in such situations. Organisations should also refrain from
exercising any undue influence to obtain personal data from minors.
Should organisations adopt a different treatment for the collection, use or disclosure
of personal data about minors?

7.12

The PDPA does not contain provisions that specifically address the collection, use or
disclosure of personal data about minors. However, given that there is generally
greater sensitivity surrounding the treatment of minors, it may be prudent for
organisations to consider putting in place relevant precautions if they are (or expect
to be) collecting, using or disclosing personal data about minors. For example,
organisations that provide services targeted at minors could state terms and
conditions in language that is readily understandable by minors, or use pictures and
other visual aids to make such terms and conditions easier to understand. Other
good practices could include placing additional safeguards against unauthorised
disclosure of, or unauthorised access to, personal data of minors, or anonymising
personal data of minors before disclosure, where feasible.

54

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

Should organisations take extra measures to verify the accuracy of personal data
about minors?
7.13

When establishing measures to comply with the Accuracy Obligation under the Data
Protection Provisions, organisations should also consider taking extra steps to verify
the accuracy of personal data about a minor, especially where such inaccuracy may
have severe consequences for the minor.

Cloud Services
What responsibilities do organisations have under the PDPA when using cloud
services to process personal data in the cloud?

8.1

When using cloud services, the organisation is responsible for complying with all
obligations under the PDPA in respect of personal data processed by the cloud
service provider (“CSP”) on its behalf and for its purposes. Processing is defined in
the PDPA as the carrying out of any operation or set of operations in relation to the
personal data, and includes recording, holding, organising, adapting or altering, and
retrieval of personal data.
What responsibilities do CSPs have under the PDPA for the personal data they
process for organisations?

8.2

Where the CSP is processing personal data on behalf and for the purposes of another
organisation pursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in writing, the CSP
is considered a data intermediary and subject to the Protection and Retention
Limitation Obligations under the PDPA. Its Protection and Retention Limitation
Obligations extend to personal data that it processes or hosts for the organisation in
data centres outside Singapore. The CSP, as an organisation in its own right, remains
responsible for complying with all Data Protection Provisions in respect of its own
activities which do not constitute processing of personal data under the contract.
More information on the obligations of data intermediaries can be found in the Key
Concepts Guidelines.
Who is responsible for complying with the Transfer Limitation Obligation for
overseas transfers of personal data as part of CSPs’ processing of personal data in
the cloud?

8.3

An organisation that engages a CSP as a data intermediary to provide cloud services
is responsible for complying with the Transfer Limitation Obligation in respect of any
overseas transfer of personal data in using the CSP’s cloud services. This is regardless
of whether the CSP is located in Singapore or overseas.
How should organisations ensure compliance with the Transfer Limitation Obligation
for overseas transfers of personal data by their CSPs?

8.4

An organisation should ensure that any overseas transfer of personal data as a result
of engaging a CSP will be done in accordance with the requirements under the PDPA,
namely, the organisation could ensure that the CSP it uses only transfers data to
locations with comparable data protection regimes, or has legally enforceable

56

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

obligations to ensure a comparable standard of protection for the transferred
personal data. Such issues of compliance can be provided for in the written contract
between an organisation and its CSP. The contract should deal with both the
standard of protection and the overseas locations
8.5

The organisation may be considered to have taken appropriate measures to comply
with the Transfer Limitation Obligation by ensuring that personal data may only be
transferred to overseas locations with comparable data protection laws, or that the
recipients (e.g. data centres or sub-processors) in these locations are legally bound
by similar contractual standards.
Example:
Organisation ABC wishes to engage CSP DEF based in Singapore to process personal
data in the cloud on its behalf. ABC had assessed that Hong Kong’s data protection
laws are comparable to the PDPA. Before signing up for its services, ABC conveys to
DEF that it only wishes to store the personal data in data centres in Singapore and
Hong Kong, and includes a clause in the contract to state so.
A data breach subsequently occurs while the personal data is in the possession of
DEF. ABC’s due diligence in engaging DEF would be taken into consideration in the
Commission’s assessment of liability when determining whether ABC has breached
its obligations under the PDPA. DEF may also be liable for breach of the Protection
Obligation.
Example:
Organisation GHI wishes to engage CSP JKL based in Singapore to process personal
data in the cloud on its behalf. JKL will only store personal data in data centres in
Singapore, Japan and South Korea. In engaging JKL’s cloud services, GHI ensures
that its contract with JKL specifies that the data centres and any sub-processors in
Japan and South Korea are legally bound to comply with standards that are
comparable to the PDPA.
A data breach subsequently occurs while the personal data is in the possession of
JKL. GHI’s due diligence in engaging JKL would be taken into consideration in the
Commission’s assessment of liability when determining whether GHI has breached
its obligations under the PDPA. JKL may also be liable for breach of the Protection
Obligation.

8.6

CSPs based in Singapore have to meet the standards of protection under the Data
Protection Provisions when they process personal data as data intermediaries.
Industry standards like ISO27001 and Tier 3 of the Multi-Tiered Cloud Security

57

ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON THE PDPA FOR SELECTED TOPICS (revised 9 October 2019)

(MTCS) Certification Scheme could provide assurance of the CSP’s ability to comply
with the Protection Obligation of the PDPA.
8.7

Where the contract between an organisation and its CSP does not specify the
locations to which a CSP may transfer the personal data processed and leaves it to
the discretion of the CSP, the organisation may be considered to have taken
appropriate steps to comply with the Transfer Limitation Obligation by ensuring that
(a) the CSP based in Singapore is certified or accredited as meeting relevant industry
standards, and (b) the CSP provides assurances that all the data centres or subprocessors in overseas locations that the personal data is transferred to comply with
these standards. For example, the organisation could consider engaging a CSP that is
certified as compliant with the ISO27001 standard and can produce technical audit
reports such as the SOC-2 upon request.
Example:
Organisation MNO wishes to purchase an off-the-shelf cloud service offered by CSP
PQR. In its standard end-user agreement, PQR does not specify the locations to
which the personal data may be transferred in the course of processing. However,
MNO ensures that all data centres and sub-processors to which personal data may
be transferred to in using PQR’s off-the-shelf cloud service are certified as compliant
with the ISO27001.
A data breach subsequently occurs while the personal data is in the possession of
PQR. MNO’s due diligence in engaging PQR would be taken into consideration in
the Commission’s assessment of liability when determining whether MNO has
breached its obligations under the PDPA. In particular, insofar as MNO has taken
appropriate steps to ensure that PQR is able to comply with the PDPA in respect of
the transferred personal data, MNO is taken to have satisfied the requirements for
the Transfer Limitation Obligation. PQR may also be liable for breach of the
Protection Obligation.
