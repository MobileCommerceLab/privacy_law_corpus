OVERVIEW

1.

Introduction

1.1

In an increasingly competitive and fast-paced environment, appropriate and
easily accessible information provides critical

support

to development

financial institutions (DFIs) in the decision making process and day-to-day
operations. In this regard, a framework to manage data and disseminate
information throughout an organisation effectively and efficiently provides
a strong foundation for well-run DFIs. Principally, such a framework should
support a high level of assurance regarding data quality that would facilitate
data mining, analysis and reporting by DFIs for the purposes of risk
management and conduct of significant business activities.
1.2

Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) expects DFIs to establish and maintain
a sound data managem e n t a n d management information system (MIS)
framework. Senior management, with appropriate oversight by the board,
must play a key role in the development of the framework to ensure the
proper allocation of resources, effective planning and coordination across the
organisation and alignment to the organisational strategic objectives, and
a corporate culture that reinforces the importance of data integrity.
Of

importance,

considerations

around

resources,

technology and

infrastructure issues need to be addressed in the context of the organisation’s
overall corporate objectives and the evolution of its business model over time.
1.3

The Guidelines on Data Management and Management Information System
for Development Financial Institutions (the Guidelines) sets out high level
guiding principles on sound data management and MIS practices that DFIs
should observe when developing internal data management capabilities. DFIs
should structure and implement data and management information systems in
a manner that is consistent with the principles set out in the Guidelines and
appropriate to each DFI’s specific business needs.

SOUND DATA MANAGEMENT AND MIS PRACTICES

Guiding Principles

Principle 1: DFIs

s h o u l d d evelop

and

implement

an

effective data

management and MIS framework that is aligned with the DFI’s business and
risk strategies. The roles of the board and senior management in relation to
the oversight, design and operationalisation of the framework should be
clearly defined.
4.1

A data management and MIS framework defines the operating framework for
meeting a D F I ’ s d a t a a n d M I S requirements to support its strategic,
operational and risk management functions. I t should set out policies,
systems and procedures relating to:

4.2

(i)

data governance (refer Principle 2);

(ii)

data architecture (refer Principle 3); and

(iii)

internal controls and reviews (refer Principles 4 and 5).

The board must maintain effective oversight over the data management and
MIS framework and ensure that the framework is aligned with the business
and risk strategies of the DFI. This includes providing direction to senior
management on broad expectations of the framework in supporting strategic
and operational decision-making. These expectations should be documented
in formal policy statements on data management and should address the
DFI’s organisational needs in terms of acceptable system performance levels,
operational reliability, data quality, security and transparency of data
management processes. The board is also responsible to ensure that
expectations are met on a continuing basis and approve strategic resource
allocations towards data management and MIS enhancement initiatives.

4.3

Senior management has operational responsibility for the design of the data
management and MIS framework. Senior management should advise the
board on the key features of the framework and any subsequent changes

BNM/RH/GL 005-15

Development Finance
and Enterprise
Department

Guidelines on Data Management
and MIS Framework for
Development Financial
Institutions

made thereto in a timely manner. In certain situations, the board may consider
it appropriate to require senior management to obtain its specific approval
(either directly or through a board-delegated committee) of key features of the
framework prior to implementation. This is relevant where the features have
significant or wider implications for the DFI’s internal decision-making
processes, timeliness and controls of information flows, privacy policies, and
interfaces within and outside the organisation.
4.4

Senior management should periodically review and advise the board on the
effectiveness of the data management and MIS framework. Such reviews
should serve to ensure that the framework remains responsive to changes in
business activities and processes, and is able to support expanding needs of
risk management and business functions over time. This includes ensuring
the scalability of system infrastructure and processes to accommodate
developments (such

as

business

acquisitions) that

have

major data

implications, the introduction of new financial products and services, and
changes in the regulatory environment. The framework, including the
technology employed, should be able to support new data requirements in
these situations economically and effectively.
4.5

The data management and MIS framework and governance structure should
be subject to independent reviews by an external party or the internal audit
function. Such reviews should provide senior management and the board with
an overall assessment of:
(i)

the adequacy of data management and MIS framework in relation to
the nature, complexity and scale of the DFI’s operations;

(ii)

appropriateness of data standards and adequacy of policies and
procedures established to meet those standards1;

1

Where appropriate, the external party or internal auditor should:- participate as observers in data cleansing exercises to further enhance the integrity of the
process; and
- assess the quality of data (e.g. completeness and accuracy) to ensure that it is preserved
throughout the end-to-end processes.

BNM/RH/GL 005-15

(iii)

Development Finance
and Enterprise

the risks inherent in the DFI’s data management and MIS environment
and effectiveness of controls in place to mitigate those risks; and

(iv)

whether adherence to established policies, procedures and controls
has been effectively maintained.

Principle 2: DFIs should establish a s ound data governance structure that
ensures the effective control of data quality.
4.6

Data governance refers to amongst others, the overall management of the
availability, usability, reliability, integrity and security of the data employed
in an organisation.

4.7

Senior management should establish appropriate governance structures that
support a clear accountability framework for the effective implementation of
the DFI’s data management policies and standards. The governance
structures must be well integrated across business units, and between
business units and the IT functions.

4.8

Functions responsible for data management must have a formal status at
senior management level within the DFIs with the appropriate authority to
implement approved data management policies and standards i n t h e
organisation. The specific responsibilities associated with data management
should be clearly defined, and should generally include:
(i)

identifying the DFI’s data needs on an ongoing basis. This includes
taking proactive steps to anticipate changing data needs in the light of
organisational or external developments, thereby pre-empting
business disruptions due to inadequate data support;

(ii)

ensuring that the DFI’s data needs are effectively incorporated
in documented data policies and procedures for the creation, capture,
maintenance, reporting, distribution and retention of data;

(iii)

translating data quality expectations set by the board into specific
goals for significant data systems and owners, and defining the
metrics for measuring data quality with respect to its accuracy,

BNM/RH/GL 005-15

Development Finance
and Enterprise
Department

Guidelines on Data Management
and MIS Framework for
Development Financial
Institutions

Page
6/13

completeness, consistency and currency (i.e. up-to-date for the
intended purpose);
(iv)

ensuring that data control functions are operating effectively to
preserve the integrity of the DFI’s data, including financial information
reported to the Bank. This includes ensuring that adequate controls
are in place to safeguard the security of the DFI’s data repositories
and the transmission of confidential and mission critical data. The
controls should also specifically address procedures to be observed
for the deletion/destruction of logical or physical data;

(v)

monitoring trends (e.g. increasing frequency of data inconsistencies or
data security breaches) which may be symptomatic of fundamental
weaknesses within t h e data systems and controls or indicative of
heightened risks of larger system failures; conducting regular reviews
and assessments of the overall operation of the data management and
MIS framework; and recommending enhancements or corrective
measures to senior management to address gaps and deficiencies
in the framework; and

(vi)

providing continuous development support, including training, updated
user guidelines or manuals, and technical support to users to ensure
smooth business operations.

4.9

For larger and more complex DFIs, consideration may be given to the
establishment of a dedicated data stewardship function which reports to and
supports senior management in discharging its responsibilities for effective
data management as outlined in paragraph 4.8. Such a function should
interact closely with relevant line functions. In other cases, DFIs may identify
existing roles within the organisation to discharge these responsibilities.

4.10 Policies and procedures, including the appropriate approving authority, for
effecting changes to data systems should be clearly defined. The policies and
procedures should appropriately reflect the significance of specific data
systems to critical business functions, with more rigorous controls entrenched
for mission-critical systems.

4.11 The deployment of alternative systems which are not aligned to the DFI’s
approved data architecture (see Principle 3) should be subject to specific
authorisation at an appropriate senior management level. A technical
assessment by a suitably skilled and objective party should be considered to
fully understand the risks to the DFIs associated with the deployment of such
systems.
4.12 Where data is managed by third party vendors under outsourcing
arrangements, senior management must ensure that effective oversight,
review and reporting arrangements are established to ensure that service
level

agreements

regarding standards on data quality, integrity and

accessibility are observed at all times.
Principle 3: A D F I ’s data management and MIS framework shoul d b e
supported by a comprehensive data and systems architecture that is
appropriate to the scale and complexity of the DFI’s operations.
4.13

The data and systems architecture defines how data is captured, processed,
stored and utilised within the overall data management and MIS framework.

4.14 A comprehensive data and systems architecture should facilitate the proper
integration of data and systems across the DFIs and should generally address
the following elements:
(i)

standards2, guidelines or common criteria and data definitions3 to be
applied in the development of systems, data repositories and
interfaces, and controls over data flows. Such protocols should be
designed to ensure that common data and MIS systems are
implemented consistently, thereby mitigating the increased cost and
risk of fragmented and disconnected flows of data within the
organisation;

3

E.g. standards applied for fair valuations of collateral and recognition of defaulted loans.
E.g. consistent use of codes and formats for common data items such as customer records and
product codes.

major types and sources of data necessary to support the organisation
and a description of the systems in place to capture such data;

(iii)

the database technology employed to support the desired data
architecture (see paragraph 4.15 below);

(iv)

administrative

structures

and

protocols

for

processing

and

disseminating data throughout the organisation, having regard, among
other things, to the organisational objectives, volume of data handled,
reporting and management information needs;
(v)

processes and systems for data repository management. The DFIs
should consider relevant legal and regulatory requirements, privacy
protection policies or standards, and the need to retain sufficiently
detailed information for a defined period to support the DFI’s internal
models and processes used for analysis and decision making; and

(vi)

appropriate data storage and back-up processes that optimise the
functioning of data systems and enable efficient and timely access to
data for the purpose of business continuity management.

4.15 DFIs should ensure that the technology employed for its data systems is
capable of transmitting and integrating data across multiple platforms and
systems in an efficient manner. This should include the ability to link and
aggregate common data records (e.g. specific customer, counterparty,
investment rating or product) residing in multiple sources as needed to
support the business and risk management functions. In addition, the
technology should also allow for the efficient integration between internally
developed and external software applications.
Principle 4: DFIs should maintain adequate data quality at all times. Data
quality should be assessed and monitored against the DFI’s data policy
statements and objectives on an ongoing basis.
4.16 Measures and controls put in place by DFIs should ensure that data
generated is accurate, complete, current (i.e. up-to-date for the intended

BNM/RH/GL 005-15

purpose)4, consistent across systems and the organisation, and supported by
clear and unambiguous data descriptions. Senior management, or the data
stewardship function where one exists, should define metrics for measuring
data quality. The metrics and target performance standards should reflect the
DFI’s desired data objectives as enumerated in the data policy statements
endorsed by the board (see paragraph 4.2).
4.17 Processes should be established to support the effective monitoring of data
quality on an ongoing basis. This may include, among other things:
(i)

the conduct of data quality assessments at regular intervals, and
whenever material changes are made to data systems, architecture or
processes;

(ii)

roles assigned to perform the monitoring functions;

(iii)

timely reporting on the outcome of data quality assessments to senior
management; and

(iv)

scheduled data quality maintenance activities to enable defects and
deteriorations in data quality to be detected and rectified promptly. This
may include establishing routine data cleansing5 and data validation6
activities.

4.18 Any systematic deterioration observed in data quality should be fully
investigated by senior management. The observations, findings and remedial
actions proposed and taken to restore data quality should be reported to the
board. The report to the board should provide an assessment of the nature
and extent of risks posed to the DFI from such deterioration, how these risks
are being managed, and the prospects and time needed to restore data
quality to the desired level. The board should promptly inform the Bank of any
developments that may have a material bearing on the DFI’s operations, risk
profile or financial condition.

Data cleansing refers to the process of detecting, removing and/or correcting data that is incorrect,
out-of-date, redundant, incomplete or formatted incorrectly from the database.
Data validation refers to the process of ensuring that a program uses data that is accurate, complete
or meets the specified criteria.

Principle 5: DFIs should maintain effective controls over data security and
privacy to preserve a high level of systems and data integrity.
4.19 Systems and data integrity refers to the reliability of information processed,
stored or transmitted both within the DFIs, and between the DFIs and their
customers or other third parties.
4.20 DFIs must establish adequate preventive and detective controls to ensure that
logical and physical access to systems and data is secure and only available
to authorised personnel for specific purposes.
4.21 The controls should be commensurate with the criticality and sensitivity of the
relevant

systems

and data handled. In this connection, policies and

procedures should be established for the classification of data, having regard
to the potential impact that unauthorised access to, or tampering of, data
could have on the DFI’s ability to accurately assess its risk exposures and
financial condition, plan and manage its financial resources, preserve
individual (including customers’) r i g h t s t o privacy, maintain the DFI’s
competitive position, and fulfill its regulatory reporting obligations.
4.22 Similarly, DFIs should identify critical data systems, generally defined as
those systems that, if disrupted or tampered with, would materially impact the
DFI’s business operations, reputation or financial condition. More rigorous
controls should be in place for access to data and systems classified as highly
sensitive or critical.
4.23 Access rights to systems and data should be clearly defined, documented and
where appropriate, segregated to prevent critical data or systems from being
compromised. Given the sensitivity of the bulk of data handled by DFIs,
access should generally be given on a “need to know” basis.
4.24 Employees should not have concurrent access to data files residing computer
facilities supporting both the production systems and backup systems.

BNM/RH/GL 005-15

and Enterprise
Department

Guidelines on Data Management
and MIS Framework for
Development Financial
Institutions

Page
11/13

Persons given access to backup files or system recovery resources should be
limited and duly authorised to have access for specific purposes and
a specified period only. Any access should be documented and logged for
audit purposes.
4.25 Access to critical data or systems by external parties (e.g system vendors and
service providers) must be properly authorised. DFIs must ensure that such
access by external parties is closely supervised, monitored and appropriately
restricted in line with the purpose of the access given. Legal agreements for
services contracted should clearly prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of
confidential data by the external party and provide for adequate remedies to
the DFI.
4.26 DFIs are generally expected to limit manual data manipulations or changes in
its day-to-day operations to a minimum level. Where manual intervention is
required (e.g. for the purpose of data patching7), the interventions should be
properly authorized and a historical log maintained for audit purposes.
4.27 Appropriate safeguards should be put in place to ensure that personal data
is not misused or disclosed in a wrongful manner. Personal information
(of customers, employees or any other parties that the DFI may conduct
business with) should be handled properly to ensure confidentiality o f
the information and compliance with relevant legislation.
4.28 To ensure that safeguards and security measures implemented over data and
IT systems are effective, DFIs are encouraged to obtain the MS ISO/IEC
27001:2007 Information Security management System (ISMS) certification for
critical systems, particularly the payment and settlements systems.

7

Data patching refers to the process of updating software by comparing the different versions of
software and extracting the differences (e.g. security or features update) between the files. Patching
can be done manually on each computer or through an automated system.

Principle 6: The operation of MIS functions should be effective and robust to
enable timely access to critical data for decision-making, analysis and control
purposes.
4.29 The MIS functions and processes must be capable of providing and
disseminating up-to-date information to a wide range of users identified as
requiring access to data for decision making, analysis or to support the DFI’s
various control, including risk management functions.
4.30 The MIS should be capable of efficiently and effectively transforming data that
is tailored to the needs of various users of information within the organisation.
Information produced by MIS systems should fulfil the DFI’s data quality
standards, and effectively address specified information needs in terms of its
relevance, timeliness and granularity to specific user groups. To achieve this,
user requirements should be clearly defined at the outset of the system
development stage, and regularly reviewed thereafter to inform subsequent
system enhancements.
