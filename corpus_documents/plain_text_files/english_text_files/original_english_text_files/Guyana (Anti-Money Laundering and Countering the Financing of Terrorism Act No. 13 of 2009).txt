order may be made against the person.

Forfeiture
order on
conviction.

46. (1) Where, upon application by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the
Court that heard the criminal case, is satisfied that property is tainted property in respect
of a serious offence of which a person has been convicted, the Court may order that
specified property be forfeited.
(2) In determining whether property is tainted property the Court may infer, in
the absence of evidence to the contrary-

possession at the time of, or immediately after the commission of
the serious offence for which the person was convicted;
