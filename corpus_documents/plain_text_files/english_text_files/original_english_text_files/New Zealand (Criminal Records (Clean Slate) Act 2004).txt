An individual is eligible under the clean slate scheme if—
(a)

he or she has completed a rehabilitation period since the date on which a
sentence was last imposed, or a specified order was last made, as a result
of a conviction for an offence, or he or she is an individual in relation to
whom an order has been made under section 9 or section 10(2); and

(b)

no custodial sentence has ever been imposed on him or her; and

or for the safety of the public, or for the safety of a person or class of
person); and

(d)

he or she has not been convicted of a specified offence; and

(e)

in the case of a court having imposed a sentence of a fine or reparation

remitted; and
(g)

(2)

Land Transport Act 1998 or under section 30A of the Transport Act
1962.

An individual in relation to whom a disqualification order has been made under
either of the sections referred to in subsection (1)(g) does not become eligible
to have the clean slate scheme apply to him or her as a consequence of the
Director removing, or having removed, the disqualification under section 100
of the Land Transport Act 1998 or section 30C of the Transport Act 1962.
Section 7(1)(g): replaced, on 1 July 2018, by section 110(1) of the Land Transport Amendment Act
2017 (2017 No 34).

8

Effect of further conviction on eligibility

(1)

If, at any time after becoming an eligible individual (either under section 7(1)
or as a consequence of an order made by the court under section 9, section 10,
or section 12), an eligible individual is convicted of an offence, he or she is no
longer an eligible individual.

(2)

An individual referred to in subsection (1) again becomes an eligible individual
if he or she—
(a)

completes a rehabilitation period beginning on the day after the date on
which he or she was sentenced for, or the specified order was made in
relation to, that conviction or is an individual in relation to whom an
order has been made under section 9 or section 10(2); and

(b)

is otherwise eligible under section 7(1) to have the clean slate scheme
apply to him or her.

9

Individual may apply to District Court for order that rehabilitation period
need not be completed

(1)

An individual who is otherwise eligible under section 7(1) may make an application to the District Court for an order under subsection (2) if—

(2)

12

(a)

the last sentence imposed on the individual was a non-custodial sentence
as a result of a conviction for an offence; and

(b)

that offence has subsequently been abolished and the act that constituted
the abolished offence no longer constitutes an offence; and

(c)

he or she is no longer subject to the non-custodial sentence.

If an application is made to the District Court under subsection (1), a registrar
must make an order that an individual need not complete a rehabilitation period
for the purposes of section 7(1)(a) if the applicant provides evidence of the
matters in subsection (1)(a) to (c).

Individual may apply to District Court for order that rehabilitation period
need not be completed or conviction be disregarded

(1)

An individual who is otherwise eligible under section 7(1) may apply to the
District Court for an order under subsection (2) if—

(2)

(a)

the last sentence imposed on the individual was a custodial sentence as a
result of a conviction for an offence; and

(b)

that offence has subsequently been abolished and the act that constituted
the abolished offence no longer constitutes an offence; and

(c)

he or she is no longer subject to the custodial sentence.

The court may, if satisfied of the matters in subsection (1)(a) to (c), make an
order—
(a)

that the individual need not complete a rehabilitation period for the purposes of section 7(1)(a); and

(b)

that the custodial sentence for the offence must be disregarded for the
purposes of section 7(1)(b).

(3)

An individual who is otherwise eligible under section 7(1) may make an application to the District Court for an order under subsection (4) if a court imposed
a non-custodial sentence on the offender for a conviction for a specified
offence.

(4)

The court may order that the conviction for the specified offence must be disregarded for the purposes of section 7(1)(d).

(5)

In considering an application under this section, a court must balance the interests of individuals in concealing their criminal records against the wider public
interest in the safety of the community (recognising that an awareness of an
individual’s previous convictions is appropriate in certain cases).

(6)

Subject to any rules of court, a court may call for and receive as evidence any
statement, document, information, matter, or thing that, in the court’s opinion,
may assist it to deal effectually with the application.

(7)

On an application under subsection (1) or subsection (3), the court must either
make the relevant order under subsection (2) or subsection (4) or decline to do
so.

(8)

The District Court may transfer an application under this section to the High
Court if it considers that it is appropriate to do so.
