The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés,
Having regard to the Council of Europe Convention N° 108 for the protection of
individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data;
Having regard to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European parliament and of the
council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing
Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), and in particular Article 35;
Having regard to the Act n°78-17 of 6 January 1978 on information technology, data
files and civil liberties;
Having regard to the Decree N° 2005-1309 of 20 October 2005 enacted for the
application of Act No 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Files and Individual

Having regard to the Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and
determining whether processing is "likely to result in a high risk" for the purposes of
Regulation 2016/679;
Having regard to Opinion 9/2018 of the European Data Protection Board on the draft
list of the competent supervisory authority of France regarding the processing
operations subject to the requirement of a data protection impact assessment (Article
35.4 GDPR) adopted on 25th September 2018;
Having heard the comments of Mrs Nacima BELKACEM, Government Commissioner,
Makes the following observations:
Article 35.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter “GDPR”) provides
that a data protection impact assessment (hereinafter “a DPIA”) must be carried out
when a processing operation is "likely to result in a high risk to the rights and
freedoms of natural persons ".
Article 35.3 GDPR illustrates what processing is likely to result in a high risk with three
types of processing. In the Guidelines on DPIA, the European Data Protection Board
(hereinafter “EDPB”) has clarified the criteria that can help to identify when processing
operations are subject to the requirement for a DPIA.
Article 35.4 GDPR provides that the competent supervisory authorities shall establish
and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the
requirement for a DPIA.

Article 35.6 GDPR provides that where such list involves processing operations, which
are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of
their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free
movement of personal data within the Union, it shall be submitted to the European
Data Protection Board’s opinion as part of the consistency mechanism.
On 14th June 2018, a draft list was adopted by the Commission and submitted to the
EDPB on 6th July 2018. The EDPB adopted an opinion on this draft decision on the
25th September 2018, which was notified to the Commission on the 2nd October 2018.
Decides :
To adopt the list of processing operations for which data protection impact assessment
(DPIA) is required which is attached to this deliberation;
This list is non-exhaustive. In accordance with Article 35.1 GDPR, a DPIA should be
carried out if the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms
of natural persons.
This list is based on the EDPD’s Guidelines on DPIA. It aims at complementing and
specifying these guidelines.
This deliberation will be published in the Official Journal of the French Republic.
