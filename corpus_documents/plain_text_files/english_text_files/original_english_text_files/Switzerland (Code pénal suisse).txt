Swiss Criminal Code

If the person concerned has served a sentence in full or in part for the
offence in another country, the Swiss court must take the sentence
served into account in determining the sentence to be imposed.
2

If the person concerned has been prosecuted in a foreign country at
the request of the Swiss authorities, then unless the offence involves a
gross violation of the principles of the Federal Constitution or the
Convention from 4 November 19505 for the protection of Human

Switzerland for the same offence if:
3

a.

the foreign court has acquitted him and the judgment has taken
full legal effect;

b.

the penalty to which he had been sentenced in the foreign
country has been served, remitted or become time-barred.

If the person prosecuted abroad at the request of the Swiss authorities
has not served the sentence or has only served it in part, the whole

decides whether a measure that has not been executed abroad or has
only been served in part must be executed or continued in Switzerland.

311.0

Swiss Criminal Code

A person fails to comply with a duty to act if he does not prevent a
legal interest protected under criminal law from being exposed to
danger or from being harmed even though, due to his legal position, he
has a duty to do so, in particular on the basis of:
2

a.

the law;

b.

a contract;

c.

a risk-bearing community entered into voluntarily; or

d.

the creation of a risk.

Any person who fails to comply with a duty to act is liable to prosecution only if, on the basis of the elements of the offence concerned,
his conduct is, in the circumstances, as culpable as it would have been
had he actively committed the offence.

The court may reduce the sentence.

Art. 12
2. Intention and
negligence
Definitions

Unless the law expressly provides otherwise, a person is only liable
to prosecution for a felony or misdemeanour if he commits it wilfully.
1

A person commits a felony or misdemeanour wilfully if he carries
out the act in the knowledge of what he is doing and in accordance
with his will. A person acts wilfully as soon as he regards the realisation of the act as being possible and accepts this.
2

A person commits a felony or misdemeanour through negligence if
he fails to consider or disregards the consequences of his conduct due
to a culpable lack of care. A lack of care is culpable if the person fails
to exercise the care that is incumbent on him in the circumstances and
commensurate with his personal capabilities.
3

Art. 13
Error of fact

If the person concerned acts under an erroneous belief as to the
circumstances, the court shall judge the act according to the circumstances as the offender believed them to be.

311.0

If any person is unlawfully attacked or threatened with imminent
attack, the person attacked and any other person are entitled to ward
off the attack by means that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Art. 16
Mitigatory selfdefence

If a person in defending himself exceeds the limits of self-defence as
defined in Article 15 and in doing so commits an offence, the court
shall reduce the sentence.
1

If a person in defending himself exceeds the limits of self-defence as
a result of excusable excitement or panic in reaction to the attack, he
does not commit an offence.
2

Art. 17
Legitimate act in
a situation of
necessity

Any person who carries out an act that carries a criminal penalty in
order to save a legal interest of his own or of another from immediate
and not otherwise avertable danger, acts lawfully if by doing so he
safeguards interests of higher value.
Art. 18

Mitigatory act in
a situation of
necessity

Any person who carries out an act that carries a criminal penalty in
order to save himself or another from immediate and not otherwise
avertable danger to life or limb, freedom, honour, property or other
interests of high value shall receive a reduced penalty if he could
reasonably have been expected to abandon the endangered interest.
1

If the person concerned could not have been reasonably expected to
abandon the endangered interest, he does not commit an offence.
2

Art. 19
Absence of legal
responsibility
due to a mental
disorder and
diminished
responsibility

1

If the person concerned was only partially able at the time of the act
to appreciate that his act was wrong or to act in accordance with this
appreciation of the act, the court shall reduce the sentence.

person concerned who, of his own accord, assists in preventing the
completion of the act.

The court may also reduce the sentence or waive any penalty in
respect of a person who withdraws from carrying out or participating
in a criminal act if the withdrawal of the person concerned would have
prevented the completion of the act had it not remained uncompleted
for other reasons.

court decides on the number according to the culpability of the offender.
A daily penalty unit normally amounts to a minimum of 30 and a
maximum of 3000 francs. By way of exception, if the offenderâ€™s
personal or financial circumstances so require, the value of the daily
penalty unit may be reduced to 10 francs. The court decides on the
value of the daily penalty unit according to the personal and financial
circumstances of the offender at the time of conviction, and in particular according to his income and capital, living expenses, any maintenance or support obligations and the minimum subsistence level. 24
2

The authorities of the Confederation, the cantons and the communes
shall provide the information required to determine the daily penalty
unit.
3

The number and value of the daily penalty units must be stated in the
judgment.
4

Art. 35
Execution

The executive authority shall specify that the offender make payment
within a period of between one and six months.25 It may stipulate
payment by instalments and on request may extend the period allowed.
1

If there is justified suspicion that the offender will fail to pay the
monetary penalty, the executive authority may request immediate
payment or the provision of security.
2

If the offender fails to pay the monetary penalty within the specified
period, the executive authority shall instruct the debt collection proceedings provided their success is expected.

Art. 36
Alternative
custodial
sentence

In the event that the offender fails to pay the monetary penalty and it
is not recoverable through debt collection procedures (Art. 35 para. 3),
the offender shall serve a custodial sentence as the alternative to the
monetary penalty. A daily penalty unit corresponds to one day in
custody. The retrospective payment of the monetary penalty leads to a
corresponding reduction in the alternative custodial sentence.

authority, the court decides on the alternative custodial sentence.

Art. 46
Breach of
probation

If the offender commits a felony or misdemeanour during the probationary period and if it therefore must be expected that he will commit
further offences, the court shall revoke the suspended sentence or the
suspended part of the sentence. If the revoked sentence and the new
sentence are of the same type, they shall form a cumulative sentence in
analogous application of Article 49.36
1

If it is not expected that the offender will commit further offences,
the court shall not revoke the suspended sentence. It may admonish the
offender or extend the probationary period by up to one half of the
duration specified in the judgment. The court may order probation
assistance and impose conduct orders for the duration of the extended
probationary period. If the extension begins after the expiry of the
probationary period, the extended period begins on the day that it is
ordered.
2

The court that judges the new felony or misdemeanour also decides
on revocation.
3

If the offender fails to attend for probation assistance or disregards
the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3â€“5 apply.
4

Revocation may no longer be ordered if three years have elapsed
since the expiry of the probationary period.

Section Three: Determination of the Sentence
Art. 47
1. Principle

The court determines the sentence according to the culpability of the
offender. It takes account of the previous conduct and the personal
circumstances of the offender as well as the effect that the sentence
will have on his life.
1

Culpability is assessed according to the seriousness of the damage or
danger to the legal interest concerned, the reprehensibility of the
conduct, the offender's motives and aims, and the extent to which the
offender, in view of the personal and external circumstances, could
have avoided causing the danger or damage.

Art. 48
2. Mitigation of
the sentence
Grounds

36

The court shall reduce the sentence if:

the offender acted:

while in serious distress,
while of the view that he was under serious threat,
at the behest of a person whom he was duty bound to
obey or on whom he was dependent;

b.

the offender was seriously provoked by the conduct of the person suffering injury;

c.

the offender acted in a state of extreme emotion that was excusable in the circumstances or while under serious psychological stress;

d.

the offender has shown genuine remorse, and in particular has
made reparation for the injury, damage or loss caused, insofar
as this may reasonably be expected of him;

e.

the need for punishment has been substantially reduced due to
the time that has elapsed since the offence and the offender has
been of good conduct in this period.

Art. 48a
Effect

If the court chooses to reduce the sentence, it is not bound by the
minimum penalty that the offence carries.
1

The court may impose a different form of penalty from that which
the offence carries, but remains bound by the statutory maximum and
minimum levels for that form of penalty.
2

Art. 49
3. Concurrent
sentencing

If the offender, by committing one or more offences, has fulfilled the
requirements for two or more penalties of the same form, the court
shall impose the sentence for the most serious offence at an appropriately increased level. It may not, however, increase the maximum level
of the sentence by more than half, and it is bound by the statutory
maximum for that form of penalty.
1

If the court must pass sentence on an offence that the offender committed before he was sentenced for a different offence, it shall determine the supplementary penalty so that the offender is not more severely punished than he would have been had the sentences been
imposed at the same time.
2

If the offender committed one or more offences before reaching the
age of 18, the court shall determine the cumulative sentence in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 such that it is not more severe than it
would have been had sentences been imposed separately.

Where a judgment must be justified, the court shall also specify the
circumstances taken into account in determining the sentence and their
weighting.
Art. 51
5. Taking
account of time
spend on remand

When determining the sentence, the court shall take account of any
time spent on remand that the offender has served in respect of the
proceedings in question or any other proceedings. One day in detention corresponds to one daily penalty unit of a monetary penalty. 37

Section Four:
Exemption from Punishment and the Suspension and

Reparation

If the offender has made reparation for the loss, damage or injury or
made every reasonable effort to right the wrong that he has caused, the
competent authority shall refrain from prosecuting him, bringing him
to court or punishing him if:
a.

a suspended custodial sentence not exceeding one year, a suspended monetary penalty or a fine are suitable as a penalty;

b.

the offender requires treatment or treatment is required in the
interest of public safety; and

c.

Swiss Criminal Code

In ordering a measure under Articles 59â€“61, 63 and 64 and in modifying the sanction in accordance with Article 65, the court shall base
its decision on an expert assessment. This shall provide an opinion on:
3

a.

the necessity and the prospects of success of any treatment of
the offender;

b.

the nature and the probability of possible additional offences;
and

c.

the ways in which the measure may be implemented.

If the offender has committed an offence in terms of Article 64
paragraph 1, the assessment must be conducted by an expert who has
neither treated the offender before nor been responsible in any other
way for his care.
4

If consideration is given to ordering lifelong incarceration in accordance with Article 64 paragraph 1bis, the court shall base its decision on reports from at least two experienced specialists who are
independent of each other and who have neither treated the offender
nor been responsible in any other way for his care.51
4bis

Normally the court only orders a measure if a suitable institution is
available.
5

Where the requirements for a measure are no longer fulfilled, it is
revoked.
6

Art. 56a
Concurrent
measures

If two or more measures are equally suitable but only one is necessary, the court shall order the measure that is more convenient for the
offender.
1

If two or more measures are necessary, the court may order these
concurrently.
2

Art. 57
Relationship
between
measures and
penalties

51

20

If the requirements for both a penalty and a measure are fulfilled, the
court shall order both sanctions.
1

The implementation of a measure under Articles 59â€“61 takes precedence over a custodial sentence that is imposed at the same time or
which is executed through revocation of a suspended sentence or recall
to custody. Likewise, the reactivation of the execution of a measure in
accordance with Article 62a takes precedence over a cumulative
sentence imposed at the same time.

2

Art. 59
2. In-patient
therapeutic
measures
Treatment of
mental disorders

If the offender is suffering from a serious mental disorder, the court
may order in-patient treatment if:
1

a.

the offender's mental disorder was a factor in a felony or misdemeanour that he committed; and

b.

it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further
offences being committed in which his mental disorder is a
factor.

The in-patient treatment is carried out in an appropriate psychiatric
institution or therapeutic institution.
2

If there is a risk of the offender absconding or committing further
offences, he shall be treated in a secure institution. He may also be
treated in a penal institution in accordance with Article 76 paragraph 2,
provided it is guaranteed that the required therapeutic treatment can be
provided by specialist staff. 53
3

The deprivation of liberty associated with in-patient treatment normally amounts to a maximum of five years. If the requirements for
parole have not yet been fulfilled after five years and if it is expected
that the measure will reduce the risk of further felonies or misdemeanours being committed in which his mental disorder is a factor, the
court may at the request of the executive authority order the extension
of the measure for a maximum of five years in any case.

The treatment is carried out in a specialised institution or, if necessary, in a psychiatric hospital. It must be adjusted to the special needs
of the offender and the state of his health.
3

The deprivation of liberty associated with in-patient treatment shall
normally amount to a maximum of three years. If the requirements for
parole have not yet been fulfilled after three years and if it is expected
that the measure will reduce the risk of further felonies or misdemeanours being committed in which his dependence is a factor, the court
may at the request of the executive authority on one occasion only
order the extension of the measure for a maximum of one further year.
In the event of an extension and the recall to custody following parole,
the deprivation of liberty associated with the measure may not exceed
a maximum of six years.
4

Art. 61
Measures for
young adults

If the offender was under 25 years of age at the time of the offence
and if he is suffering from a serious developmental disorder, the court
may commit him to an institution for young adults if:
1

a.

the offender's developmental disorder was a factor in the felony or misdemeanour that he committed; and

b.

it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further
offences being committed in which his developmental disorder
is a factor.

Institutions for young adults must be managed separately from other
institutions and facilities under this Code.
2

The offender should be taught the skills needed to live independently
and without further offending. In particular, he should be encouraged
to undergo basic and advanced vocational and professional training.
3

The deprivation of liberty associated with the measure amounts to a
maximum of four years. In the event of the recall to custody following
release on parole, it may not exceed a maximum of six years. The
measure must be revoked when the offender reaches the age of 30.
4

If the offender was convicted of an offence committed before he was
18 years of age, the measure may be implemented in an institution for
minors.
5

Art. 62
Parole

22

311.0

Swiss Criminal Code

The offender is released on parole from undergoing an in-patient
measure as soon as his condition justifies his being given the liberty to
prove himself.
1

In the case of release on parole from a measure under Article 59, the
probationary period amounts to one to five years, and in the case of
release on parole from a measure under Articles 60 and 61, from one
to three years.
2

The person released on parole may be required to undergo out-patient
treatment during the probationary period. The executive authority may
order probation assistance and issue conduct orders for the duration the
probationary period.
3

If on expiry of the probationary period, a continuation of the outpatient treatment, the probation assistance or the conduct orders is
considered necessary in order to reduce the risk of further felonies and
misdemeanours being committed that are associated with the condition
of the person released on parole, the court may at the request of the
executive authority extend the probationary period as follows:
4

a.

by one to five years in the case of release on parole from a
measure in accordance with Article 59;

b.

by one to three years in the case of release on parole from a
measure under Articles 60 and 61.

The probationary period following release on parole from a measure
under Articles 60 and 61 may not exceed six years.
5

If the offender has committed an offence in terms of Article 64
paragraph 1, the probationary period may be extended as often as is
considered necessary to prevent further such offences being committed.
6

Art. 62a
Breach of
probation

If a person released on parole commits an offence during the probationary period and thus demonstrates that the risk that the measure was
intended to reduce is still present, the court assessing the new offence
may, after consulting the executive authority:
1

a.

order his recall to custody;

b.

revoke the measure and, provided the relevant requirements
are fulfilled, order a new measure; or

c.

revoke the measure and, provided the relevant requirements
are fulfilled, order the execution of a custodial sentence.

If as a result of the new offence the requirements for an unsuspended
custodial sentence are fulfilled and if this sentence runs concurrently
with a custodial sentence that has been suspended to give precedence
2

23

Swiss Criminal Code

to the measure, the court shall impose a cumulative sentence in application of Article 49.
If as a result of the conduct of the person released on parole during
the probationary period there is a serious expectation that he could
commit an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1, the court that
ordered the measure may, at the request of the executive authority,
order a recall to custody.
3

For a measure under Article 59, the recall to custody is for a maximum period of five years, and for measures under Articles 60 and 61
for a maximum period of two years.
4

If the court decides against a recall to custody or a new measure, it
may:
5

a.

admonish the person released on parole;

b.

order out-patient treatment or probation assistance;

c.

impose conduct orders on the person released on parole; and

d.

extend the probationary period by from one to five years in the
case of a measure under Article 59, and by from one to three
years in the case of a measure under Articles 60 and 61.

If the person released on parole fails to comply with the terms of
probation assistance or disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3â€“5 applies.
6

Art. 62b
Final release

If the person released on parole successfully completes the probationary period, he is granted final release.
1

The offender is granted final release if the maximum duration of a
measure under Articles 60 and 61 is reached and the requirements for
the parole apply.
2

If deprivation of liberty associated with the measure is for a shorter
period than the suspended custodial sentence, the remainder of the
sentence is not executed.
3

Art. 62c
Termination of a
measure

24

1

A measure is terminated, if:
a.

its implementation or continuation appears to have no prospect
of success;

b.

the maximum duration under Articles 60 and 61 has been
reached and the requirements for the parole do not apply; or

c.

a suitable institution does not exist or no longer exists.

Swiss Criminal Code

311.0

If the deprivation of liberty associated with the measure is for a
shorter period than the suspended custodial sentence, the remainder of
the sentence is executed. If the requirements for parole or a suspended
custodial sentence apply in relation to the remainder of the sentence,
execution of the sentence is suspended.
2

Instead of ordering the execution of the sentence, the court may order
another measure if it is to be expected that such a measure will reduce
the risk of the offender committing further felonies and misdemeanours in which his condition is a factor.
3

If there is a serious expectation that if a measure ordered in respect of
an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1 is terminated, the offender will commit further such offences, the court may at the request of
the executive authority order his indefinite incarceration.
4

If the competent authority regards an adult protection measure to be
appropriate on the termination of the measure, it shall inform the adult
protection authority of this.54
5

Furthermore, the court may terminate an in-patient therapeutic measure before or during its implementation and order another in-patient
therapeutic measure in its place if it is expected that the new measure
has a significantly better chance of reducing the risk of the offender
committing further felonies and misdemeanours in which his condition
is a factor.
6

Art. 62d
Consideration of
release and the
termination of
measures

The competent authority shall on request or ex officio consider
whether and when the offender should be released on parole from the
implementation of the measure or whether the measure should be
terminated. It makes a decision on such matters at least once each year.
It shall first grant a hearing to the offender and obtain a report from the
governing body of the relevant institution.
1

If the offender committed an offence in terms of Article 64 paragraph
1, the competent authority shall reach its decision on the basis of the
expert opinion of an independent specialist and after hearing a committee comprising representatives of the prosecution services, the
execution authorities and one or more psychiatrists. The specialists and
psychiatrists concerned must not be those responsible for the treatment
or care of the offender.

the offender commits an offence in which his condition is a
factor; and

b.

it is expected that the measure will reduce the risk of further
offences being committed in which his condition is a factor.

The court may defer the execution of an unsuspended custodial
sentence imposed at the same time, a suspended custodial sentence due
for execution following revocation of suspension and the remainder of
a sentence due for execution following a recall to custody to give
precedence to out-patient treatment in order to take account of the
form of the treatment. It may order probation assistance and issue
conduct orders for the duration the treatment.
2

The competent authority may order the offender to be treated temporarily as an in-patient if this is required in order to initiate the outpatient treatment. The period of in-patient treatment may not exceed
two months.
3

The period of out-patient treatment may not normally exceed five
years. If the continuation of the out-patient treatment is considered
necessary at the end of the five-year period in order to reduce the risk
of further felonies and misdemeanours in which a mental disorder is a
factor, the court may at the request of the executive authority continue
the treatment for a further period of from one to five years.
4

Art. 63a
Termination of
the measure

The competent authority shall assess at least once each year whether
the out-patient treatment should be continued or terminated. It shall
first grant a hearing to the offender and obtain a report from the therapists.
1

2

The out-patient treatment is terminated by the competent authority if:
a.

it has been successfully completed;

b.

its continuation appears to have no prospect of success; or

c.

the statutory maximum duration for the treatment of an alcohol, drug or therapeutic product dependent person has been
reached.

If the offender commits a further offence during the out-patient
treatment and thus demonstrates that this form of treatment will probably be unsuccessful in averting the risk offences being committed in
which the condition of the offender is a factor, the unsuccessful treat3

If the offender fails to comply with the conditions of probation
assistance or if he disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs
3â€“5 applies.
4

Art. 63b
Execution of the
suspended
custodial
sentence

If the out-patient treatment has been successfully completed, the
suspended custodial sentence is not executed.
1

If out-patient treatment is terminated due to there being no prospect
of success (Art. 63a para. 2 let. b), the statutory maximum duration
being reached (Art. 63a para. 2 let. c) or its being unsuccessful (Art.
63a para. 3), the suspended custodial sentence is executed.
2

If out-patient treatment conducted while the offender is at liberty is
considered a risk to third parties, the suspended custodial sentence is
executed and the out-patient treatment continued while the custodial
sentence is being served.
3

The court decides on the extent to which the deprivation of liberty
associated with the out-patient treatment is taken into account in
determining the custodial sentence. If the requirements for parole or a
suspended custodial sentence apply in relation to the remainder of the
sentence, execution of the sentence is suspended.
4

Instead of the execution of the sentence the court may order an inpatient therapeutic measure under Articles 59â€“61 if it is to be expected
that this will reduce the risk of the offender committing further felonies or misdemeanours in which his condition is a factor.

Article 59 does not promise any success.
The court shall order lifelong incarceration if the offender has
committed murder, intentional homicide, serious assault, robbery,

b.

the treatment offers no long-term prospect of success.57

The execution of the custodial sentence takes priority over indefinite
incarceration. The provisions on parole in relation to the custodial
sentence (Art. 86â€“88) do not apply.58

If during the execution of the custodial sentence, it is expected that
the offender will prove to be of good behaviour when at liberty, the
court shall order parole from the custodial sentence at the earliest from
the time when the offender has served two thirds of a specific custodial
sentence or 15 years of a life sentence. The court that ordered indefinite incarceration is responsible for the decision on parole. In addition,

Art. 64c62
Consideration of
release from
lifelong incarceration and
parole

In cases of lifelong incarceration under Article 64 paragraph 1bis the
competent authority shall consider ex officio or on application whether
there are any new scientific findings that lead to the expectation that
the offender can be treated so that he will no longer pose a risk to the
public. It decides on the basis of a report from the Federal Commission
for the Assessment of the Treatability of Offenders subject to Lifelong
Incarceration.
1

If the competent authority concludes that the offender can be treated,
it shall offer him the option of treatment. Treatment is carried out in a
secure institution. Until the order imposing lifelong incarceration has
been revoked in accordance with paragraph 3, the provisions on the
execution of lifelong incarceration continue to apply.
2

If the treatment demonstrates that the risk posed by the offender has
been considerably reduced and may be reduced to the extent that he no
longer poses a risk to the public, the court shall revoke the order imposing lifelong incarceration and order an in-patient therapeutic measure in accordance with Articles 59â€“61 in a secure institution.
3

The court may grant the offender parole from lifelong incarceration if
he no longer poses a risk to the public due to old age, serious illness or
on other grounds. Parole is governed by Article 64a.
4

The court that ordered lifelong incarceration is responsible for deciding whether parole should be granted. It bases its decision on reports
from at least two experienced specialists who are independent of each
other and who have neither treated the offender nor been responsible in
any other way for his care.
5

Paragraphs 1 and 2 also apply during the execution of the custodial
sentence that precedes lifelong incarceration. Lifelong incarceration
shall be revoked in accordance with paragraph 3 at the earliest when
the offender has served two thirds of a specific custodial sentence or
15 years of a life sentence.

sentence is deferred.

If during the execution of the custodial sentence, new information or

and procedure are determined by the rules that apply to re-opening a

Section Two: Other Measures
Art. 66
1. Good
behaviour bond

If there is the risk that a person will commit a felony or misdemeanour that he has threatened to commit, or if a person convicted of a
felony or of a misdemeanour indicates the clear intention to repeat the
offence, the court may, at the request of the person threatened, obtain a
promise from the offender that he will not commit the offence and
require him to deposit appropriate security therefor.
1

If he refuses to make the promise, or fails to deposit the security
within the specified period, the court may require him to make the
promise or deposit the security by imposing a period of detention for
security reasons. The period of detention for security reasons may not
be for more than two months. It is executed in the same way as a short
custodial sentence (Art. 7965).

If the offender commits the felony or the misdemeanour within two
years of depositing the security, the security is forfeited to the State. If
no offence is committed, the security is returned.

and has as a result received a custodial sentence in excess of six
months, and if there is a risk that he will abuse his activity in order to
commit a further felony or misdemeanour, the court may prohibit him

nature, the court may prohibit him from carrying on the activity concerned for one to ten years.

two or more offences in the same proceedings, the court shall specify
what portion of the sentence or which measure applies to an offence

By means of a contact prohibition and exclusion order the court may
prohibit the offender from:
2

a.

contacting one or more specific persons or persons in a specific group directly or via third parties, in particular by telephone,
in writing or online, or employing, accommodating, educating,
caring for such persons or associating with such persons in any
other way;

These devices may in particular serve to determine the offenderâ€™s
location.
3

The court may order probation assistance for the duration of the

orders

A prohibition order comes into effect on the day on which the judgment takes full legal effect.

of the prohibition order.
2

If the offender fails to complete the probationary period successfully
and if the suspended custodial sentence is executed or a recall to
custody is ordered in respect of a sentence or measure, the term of the
prohibition order is calculated from the day on which the offender is
released on parole or granted final release or on which the sanction is
revoked or remitted.

If the offender completes the probationary period successfully, the
competent authority shall decide on any modification of the conditions
or term of the prohibition order under Article 67 paragraph 1 or Article

a.

in the case of a prohibition order under Article 67 paragraph 1
or under Article 67b: after the order has been in force for two

provided reasonable compensation for the loss, damage or injury
caused, the competent authority shall revoke the prohibition order in
cases falling under paragraph 4 or 5.

Art. 69
5. Forfeiture
a. Forfeiture of
dangerous
objects

The court shall, irrespective of the criminal liability of any person,
order the forfeiture of objects that have been used or were intended to
be used for the commission of an offence or that have been produced
as a result of the commission of an offence in the event that such
objects constitute a future danger to public safety, morals or public
order.
1

The court may order that the objects forfeited be rendered unusable
or be destroyed.
2

Art. 70
b. Forfeiture of
assets
Principles

The court shall order the forfeiture of assets that have been acquired
through the commission of an offence or that are intended to be used
in the commission of an offence or as payment therefor, unless the
assets are passed on to the person harmed for the purpose of restoring
the prior lawful position.
1

Forfeiture is not permitted if a third party has acquired the assets in
ignorance of the grounds for forfeiture, provided he has paid a consideration of equal value therefor or forfeiture would cause him to endure
disproportionate hardship.
2

The right to order forfeiture is limited to seven years; if, however, the
prosecution of the offence is subject to a longer limitation period, this
period also applies to the right to order forfeiture.
3

Official notice must be given of forfeiture. The rights of persons
harmed or third parties expire five years after the date on which official notice is given.
4

If the amount of the assets to be forfeited cannot be ascertained, or
may be ascertained only by incurring a disproportionate level of trouble and expense, the court may make an estimate.
5

Art. 71
Equivalent claim

If the assets subject to forfeiture are no longer available, the court
may uphold a claim for compensation by the State in respect of a sum
of equivalent value, which claim may be enforced against a third party
only if he is not excluded by Article 70 paragraph 2.
1

The court may dismiss an equivalent claim in its entirety or in part if
the claim is likely to be unrecoverable or if the claim would seriously
hinder the rehabilitation of the person concerned.
2

The investigating authority may seize assets of the person concerned
with a view to the enforcement of an equivalent claim. Such seizure
does not accord the State preferential rights in the enforcement of the
equivalent claim.

Art. 72
Forfeiture of
assets of a
criminal
organisation

The court shall order the forfeiture of all assets that are subject to the
power of disposal of a criminal organisation. In the case of the assets
of a person who participates in or supports a criminal organisation
(Art. 260ter), it is presumed that the assets are subject to the power of
disposal of the organisation until the contrary is proven.
Art. 73

6. Use for the
benefit of the
person harmed

If as a result of a felony or misdemeanour a person has suffered harm
and is not entitled to benefits under an insurance policy, and if it is
anticipated that the offender will not pay damages or satisfaction, the
court shall award the person harmed, at his request, a sum of money up
to the amount of damages or satisfaction set by a court or agreed in a
settlement with the person harmed and obtained from:
1

a.

the monetary penalty or fine paid by the offender;

b.

objects and assets that have been forfeited, or the proceeds of
their sale after deduction of expenses;

c.

compensatory claims;

d.

the amount of the good behaviour bond.

The court may order such an award only if the person harmed assigns
the corresponding element of his claim to the State.

The cantons shall provide a simple and quick procedure for cases
where their courts are not entitled to make an award of this nature in a
criminal judgment.

Title Four:
Execution of Custodial Sentences and Custodial Measures
Art. 74
1. Principles

The human dignity of the prison inmates or of the inmates of an institution for the execution of measures must be respected. Their rights
may only be limited to the extent that that is required for the deprivation of their liberty and their co-existence in the penal institution.
Art. 75

2. Execution of
custodial
sentences
Principles

The execution of sentences must encourage an improvement in the
social behaviour of the prison inmates, and in particular their ability to
live their lives without offending again. The conditions under which
sentences are executed must correspond as far as possible with those
of normal life, guarantee the supervision of the prison inmates, counteract the harmful consequences of the deprivation of liberty and take
1

43

311.0

Swiss Criminal Code

appropriate account of the need to protect the general public, the
institution staff and other inmates.
2

...99

The institution rules shall provide that a sentence management plan
be drawn up in consultation with the prison inmate. This plan in particular contains details of the supervision offered, the opportunities to
work and receive basic or advanced training, making reparation,
relations with the outside world and preparations for release.
3

The prison inmate must actively cooperate in resocialisation efforts
and the preparations for release.
4

Account is taken of the gender-specific concerns and needs of the
prison inmates.
5

If the prison inmate is released on parole or granted final release and
it subsequently comes to light that on his release he was subject to
another executable judgment imposing a custodial sentence, execution
of that custodial sentence is waived if:
6

a.

it was not executed concurrently with the other custodial sentence for a reason within the control of the executive authorities;

b.

the prison inmate was able to assume in good faith that on his
release he was not subject to another executable judgment imposing a custodial sentence; and

c.

the reintegration of the prison inmates would be prejudiced.

Art. 75a100
Special security
measures

The Commission under Article 62d paragraph 2 shall with a view to
a transfer to an open penal institution and the authorisation of a relaxation in the execution of the sentence assess the danger to the community of the offender if:
1

a.

he has committed a felony in terms of Article 64 paragraph 1;
and

b.

the executive authority cannot satisfactorily answer the question of whether he is a danger to other prison inmates.

Relaxation of the execution of the sentence involves easing the
regime for the deprivation of liberty, in particular by means of a transfer to an open institution, the granting of release on temporary licence,
the authorisation of day release employment or of external accommodation and the granting of parole.

Art. 76
Place of
execution

Custodial sentences are executed in a secure or open penal institution.
1

The prison inmate shall be admitted to a secure penal institution or to
the secure section of an open penal institution if there is a risk that that
he will abscond or it is expected that he will commit further offences.
2

Art. 77
Normal execution

The prison inmate normally spends his working, rest and leisure time
in the institution.
Art. 77a

Day release
employment and
external
accommodation

The custodial sentence is executed in the form of day release employment if the prison inmate has served part of the custodial sentence,
normally a minimum one half, and it is not expected that he will abscond or commit further offences.
1

In day release employment, the prison inmate works outside the
institution and spends his rest and leisure time in the institution. The
change to day release employment normally takes place following an
appropriate period spent in an open institution or the open section of a
secure institution. Work outside the institution may also include
housework and caring for children.
2

If the prison inmate proves himself to be of good behaviour in day
release employment, the further execution of the sentence takes the
form of external accommodation and day release employment. Here
the prison inmate lives and works outside the institution , but remains
under the supervision of the executive authority.
3

Art. 77b101
Semi-detention

At the offenderâ€™s request, a custodial sentence of no more than 12
months or the remainder of a sentence after taking account of time
spent on remand of no more than six months may be served in the
form of semi-detention provided:

Semi-detention may be served in a special section of a remand centre
provided the offender is guaranteed the required supervision.
3

If the offender no longer meets the authorisation requirements or if
he fails to comply with the conditions of semi-detention imposed by
the executive authority despite being warned to do so, the custodial
sentence shall be served in the normal manner.
4

Art. 78
Solitary confinement

Solitary confinement in the form of uninterrupted separation from
other prison inmates may only be ordered:
a. for a maximum of one week at the start of the sentence in order
to initiate the execution of the sentence;
b. for the protection of the prison inmate or of third parties;
c. as a disciplinary sanction.
Art. 79102
Art. 79a103

Community
service

If it is not anticipated that the offender will abscond or commit
further offences, the following sentences may be served in the form of
community service:
1

a.

a custodial sentence of no more than six months;

b.

the remainder of a sentence of no more than six months after
taking account of time spent on remand; or

c.

a monetary penalty or a fine.

Community service is not permitted as a means of serving an alternative custodial sentence.
2

Community service is work that benefits social institutions, public
works or persons in need. The work is unpaid.

service imposed by the executive authority despite being warned to do
so, the custodial sentence shall be served in the normal manner or in

Electronic
monitoring

At the request of the offender, the executive authority may order the
use of electronic devices and their secure attachment to the offenderâ€™s
body (electronic monitoring):

a.

in execution of a custodial sentence or an alternative custodial
sentence of from 20 days to 12 months; or

b.

Art. 86
Parole
a. Granting of
parole

If the prison inmate has served two thirds of his sentence, provided
this amounts to at least three months, he shall be released on parole by
the competent authority if this is justified by his conduct while in
custody and it is not expected that he will commit further felonies or
misdemeanours.
1

The competent authority shall assess ex officio whether the inmate
may be released on parole. It shall obtain a report from the institution
board. The prison inmate shall be granted a hearing.
2

If parole is refused, the competent authority must reassess the question of whether parole may be granted at least once each year.
3

If the prison inmate has served half of his sentence, provided this
amounts to at least three months, he may be released on parole by way
of exception, if exceptional personal circumstances justify this.
4

In the case of persons serving a life sentence, parole under paragraph
1 is possible at the earliest after 15 years, and under paragraph 4 at the
earliest after ten years.

Art. 87
b. Probationary
period

A person released on parole is made subject to a probationary period
of a duration that corresponds to the remainder of his sentence. The
period however amounts to at least one year and no more than five
years.

The executive authority shall normally order probation assistance for
the duration of the probationary period. It may impose conduct orders
on the person released on parole.

If parole is granted to an inmate serving a custodial sentence for an
offence mentioned in Article 64 paragraph 1, and if on expiry of the
probationary period a continuation of the probation assistance or the
conduct orders appear to be required in order to reduce the risk of
further offences of this type being committed, the court may at the
request of the executive authority extend the probation assistance or
the conduct orders in each case by one to five years or impose a new
conduct order for this period. A recall to custody in accordance with
Article 95 paragraph 5 is not possible in such cases.

Art. 89
d. Breach of
probation

If a person released on parole commits a felony or misdemeanour
during the probationary period, the court judging the new offence shall
order his recall to custody.
1

If, despite the commission of a felony or misdemeanour during the
probationary period, it is not expected that the offender will commit
further offences, the court shall dispense with a recall to custody. It
may admonish the offender and extend the probationary period by no
more than half of the period originally fixed by the competent authority. If the extension is ordered after the expiry of the original probationary period, it begins on the day on which it is ordered. The provisions on probation assistance and conduct orders apply (Art. 93â€“95).
2

If a person released on parole fails to comply with the conditions of
probation assistance or disregards the conduct orders, Article 95 paragraphs 3â€“5 applies.
3

A recall to custody may not be ordered if three years have elapsed
since the expiry of the probationary period.
4

Any period of time spent on remand that the offender has served
during the recall to custody proceedings is taken into account in the
remainder of his sentence.
5

If the requirements for an unsuspended custodial sentence are fulfilled due to the new offence and if this coincides with the remainder
of the sentence that must be executed by the recall to custody, the
court shall impose a cumulative sentence in application of Article 49 a.
The rules on parole again apply to this sentence. If only the remainder
of the sentence is executed, Article 86 paragraphs 1â€“4 applies.
6

If the remainder of a sentence that must be executed in accordance
with a decision on recall to custody coincides with the execution of a
measure under Articles 59â€“61, Article 57 paragraphs 2 and 3 applies.

Art. 90
3. Execution of
measures

A person subject to the execution of a measure under Articles 59â€“61,
may only be accommodated without interruption separately from the
other inmates of an institution for the execution of measures if this is
essential:
1

a.

as a temporary therapeutic measure;

b.

for the protection of other inmates of the institution or of third
parties;

c.

as a disciplinary sanction.

At the start of the execution of the measure, a sentence management
plan is drawn up in consultation with the inmate or his legal representative. This includes in particular details of the treatment of the
2

inmate's mental disorder, dependence or developmental disorder and
on measures to prevent the endangerment of others.
Measures under Articles 59â€“61 and 64 may be executed in the
form of external accommodation and day release employment if there
is a justified opinion that this will significantly contribute to the aim of
the measure being achieved, and if there is no risk that the inmate will
abscond or will commit further offences. Article 77a paragraphs 2 and
3 applies by analogy.107

If the inmate is able to work, he is required to work to the extent that
his in-patient treatment or care requires or permits. Articles 81â€“83

or her recapture.

The executive authority decides on the request after consulting the
offender.
2

It may refuse to provide the information or revoke a previous decision to provide information only if the offenderâ€˜s legitimate interests
justify this.
3

If the executive authority approves a request, it shall advise the

Art. 119144
Legal abortion

The termination of a pregnancy is exempt from penalty in the event
that the termination is, in the judgment of a physician, necessary in
order to be able to prevent the pregnant woman from sustaining serious physical injury or serious psychological distress. The risk must be
greater the more advanced the pregnancy is.

the written request of a pregnant woman, who claims that she is in a
state of distress, it is performed within twelve weeks of the start of the
pregnant womanâ€™s last period by a physician who is licensed to practise his profession. The physician must have a detailed consultation
with the woman prior to the termination and provide her with appropriate counselling.
2

If the woman is incapable of judgement, the consent of her legal
representative is required.
3

The cantons designate the medical practices and hospitals that fulfil
the requirements for the professional conduct of procedures to terminate pregnancy and for the provision of counselling.

Art. 333
1 The general provisions of this Code apply to offences provided for in
Application of
the General
other federal acts unless these federal acts themselves contain detailed
Provisions to
other federal acts provisions on such offences.
2

In the other federal acts, the terms below are replaced as follows:
a.

penal servitude by a custodial sentence of more than one year;

b.

imprisonment by a custodial sentence not exceeding three
years or by a monetary penalty;

c.

imprisonment for less than six months by a monetary penalty,
whereby a one-month custodial sentence corresponds to a
monetary penalty of 30 daily penalty units up to a maximum of
3000 francs.

An offence that carries a maximum penalty of detention or a fine or
of a fine only is a contravention. Articles 106 and 107 apply. Article 8
of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974418 on Administrative Criminal
Law is reserved. An offence is also a contravention if, in terms of
another Federal Act that came into force before 1942, it carries a term
of imprisonment not exceeding three months.
3

Sentences of lengths differing from those mentioned in paragraph 2
and Article 41 as well as fines of amounts differing from those mentioned in Article 106 are reserved.
4

If another federal act provides for a fine to be imposed for a felony or
misdemeanour, Article 34 applies. Rules on determining a penalty that
differ from Article 34 do not apply. Article 8 of the Federal Act of 22
March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law remains reserved. If the
fine is limited to a sum under 1 080 000 francs, this limit no longer
applies. If the fine is limited to a sum exceeding 1 080 000 francs, this
limit continues to apply. In this case, the maximum number of daily
penalty units equals the current maximum fine divided by 3000.
