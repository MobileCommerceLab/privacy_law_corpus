The Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017
(“the Law”)

Special Category Data

At a glance
•

Special category data is personal data which the Law recognises as more sensitive, and is
therefore given higher levels of protection.

•

In order to lawfully process special category data, you must identify a lawful processing
condition from either Part II or Part III of Schedule 2 of the Law.

•

You must determine and document the condition for processing special category data
before you begin any processing under the Law.

What is special category data?
“Special Category Data” means –
•

•
•

personal data revealing an individual’s –
- Racial or ethnic origin

health data
personal data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual orientation
criminal data

What's new?
Special category data is broadly similar to the concept of sensitive personal data under the
2001 Law. The requirement to identify a specific condition for processing this type of data is
also very similar. The standards that apply to ensure compliance with the Law remain broadly
similar but are enhanced in a number of areas. It is important to ensure you read, understand
and act upon the new conditions that apply.
What’s different about special category data?
It is recognised that this type of data could create more significant risks to a person’s
fundamental rights and freedoms, for example, by putting those persons at risk of unlawful
discrimination.
What are the conditions for processing special category data?
The conditions are listed in Parts II and III of Schedule 2 which are replicated below:Part II
