Title I
General Obligations
19.
(1) The controller, taking into account the nature,
scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of
varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural

measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is
performed in accordance with these regulations, including where
proportionate, the implementation of appropriate data protection
policies by the controller.

Obligations of the
controller.

(2)
The measures referred to in sub-regulation (1) shall be
reviewed and updated where necessary.
20.
(1)
The controller, taking into account the state of the
art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and
purposes of processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and
severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the
processing, both at the time of the determination of the means for
processing and at the time of the processing itself, shall implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as
pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data protection
principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to
integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing, in order to meet
the requirements of these regulations and protect the rights of data
subjects.

Data protection by
design and by
default.

(2)
The controller shall implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures ensuring that, by default, only personal data
which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are
processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data
collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and
their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by
default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's
intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.
21.
(1)
Where two or more controllers jointly determine
the purposes and means of processing, they shall be deemed to be joint
controllers.
(2)
Joint controllers shall, in a transparent manner, determine
their respective responsibilities for compliance with these regulations,
in particular as regards the exercise of the rights of the data subject and
their respective duties to provide the information referred to in
regulation 13, by means of an arrangement between them unless, and

Joint controllers.

is to act as a single contact point for data subjects:

by a law, that law shall apply notwithstanding any agreement between
the controllers.
Processor.

22.
(1)
Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of
a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing
sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet
the requirements of these regulations and ensure the protection of the
rights of the data subject.
(2)
It shall not be lawful for the processor to engage another
processor without prior specific or general written authorisation by the
controller:
Provided that in the case of general written authorisation,
the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes
concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby
giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes.
(3)
The processing by a processor shall be governed by a
contract, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller
and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the
nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and
categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the
controller. That contract shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:
(a)

acts only on instructions from the controller;

(b)

writing, including in an electronic form, shall be made nonetheless.
(3)

The notification referred to in sub-regulation (1) shall at

least:
(a)
describe the nature of the personal data breach
including, where possible, the categories and approximate

Where the personal data breach involves personal data
that have been transmitted by or to the controller of another Member
State, the information referred to in sub-regulation (3), shall be
communicated to such controller without undue delay.

breach to the data
subject.

31.
(1)
In the case of a personal data breach which is
likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach, in
writing, to the data subject without undue delay:
Provided that in cases where it is not feasible to
communicate the data breach to the data subject in writing, or where
due to the severity of the personal data breach and the possible

EXECUTION OF CRIMINAL PENALTIES

[ S.L. 586.08

breach to the data subject is not made immediately, such
communication may be made through other means.
(2)
The communication to the data subject referred to in subregulation (1) shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of
the personal data breach and shall contain at least the information and
measures referred to in regulation 30(3)(b), (c) and (d).
(3)
The communication to the data subject referred to in subregulation (1) shall not be required if any of the following conditions
are met:

measures were applied to the personal data affected by the
personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal
data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access
it, such as encryption;
(b)
the controller has taken subsequent measures
which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of
data subjects referred to in sub-regulation (1) is no longer likely
to materialise;

public communication or a similar measure whereby the data
subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.
(4)
If the controller has not already communicated the
personal data breach to the data subject, the Commissioner, having
considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a
high risk, may require it to do so, or may decide that any of the
conditions referred to in sub-regulation (3) are met.
(5)
The communication to the data subject referred to in subregulation (1) may be delayed, restricted or omitted subject to the
conditions and on the grounds referred to in regulation 13(3).
