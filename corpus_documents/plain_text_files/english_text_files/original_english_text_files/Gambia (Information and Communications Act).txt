accessible in a form in which it may be read, stored and retrieved by the other party, whether electronically or as a computer printout as long as the information is reasonably
capable of being reduced to electronic form by the party incorporating it.
1. Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is not contained in the data message purporting to give rise to the legal effect,
but is merely referred to in that data message.
2. Where an enactment requires any information or record to be in writing, that requirement shall be satisfied by an electronic record where the information contained in it is
accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.
3. (1) A requirement in a law for multiple copies of a document to be submitted to a single addressee at the same time is satisfied by the submission of a single data message
that is capable of being reproduced by that addressee.
(2) An expression in a law, whether used as a noun or verb, including the terms "document", "record", "file", "submit", "lodge", "deliver", "issue", "publish", "write in", "print" or words
or expressions of similar effect, shall be interpreted so as to include or permit the form, format or action in relation to a data message unless otherwise
Retention of information

provided for in this Act.
(3)
Where a seal is required by law to be affixed to a document and the law does not prescribe the method or form by which the document may be sealed by electronic means, that
requirement is met if the document indicates that it is required to be under seal and it includes the advanced electronic signature of the person by whom it is required to be sealed.
(4)
Where a law requires or permits a person to send a document or information by registered or certified post or similar service, that requirement is met if an electronic copy of the
document or information is sent to a service provider authorized by the Authority, is registered by the service provider and sent by that service provider to the electronic address
provided by the sender.
181. (1) Where a rule of law requires that certain documents, records or information be retained, that requirement is satisfied by retaining them in the form of electronic records, if
the following conditions are satisfied
(a)
the information contained in them remains accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference;
(b)
the electronic record is retained in the format in which it was originally generated, sent or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to represent accurately the
information originally generated, sent or received;
(c)
such information, if any, as enables the identification of the origin and destination of an electronic record and the date and time when it was sent or received, is retained; and
(d)
the consent of the department of the Government, organ of State or the statutory body, which has supervision over the
Retention of information in original form

requirement for the retention of such records, has been obtained.
(2)
An obligation to retain documents, records or information in accordance with subsection (1)(c) does not extend to any information necessarily and automatically generated solely
for the purpose of enabling a record to be sent or received.
(3)
A person may satisfy the requirement referred to in subsection (1) by using the services of any other person, if the conditions in subsection (1)(a) to (d) are complied with.
(4)
Nothing in this section
(a)
applies to any rule of law which expressly provides for the retention of documents, records or information in the form of electronic records;
(b)

precludes any department of the Government, organ of State or a statutory corporation from specifying additional requirements for the retention of electronic records that are
subject to the jurisdiction of the Ministry or other organ of State or statutory body.

182. (1) Where the law requires information to be presented or retained in its original form, that requirement is met by electronic record if
(a)
there exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of the information from the time when it was first generated in its final form, as an electronic message or otherwise; and
(b)
where it is required that information be presented, that information is capable of being displayed to the person to whom it is to be presented.
(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement in that subsection is in the form of an
Production of document or information

obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being presented or retained in its original form.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a)
(a)
the criteria for assessing integrity are whether the information has remained complete and unaltered, except for
(i)
the addition of any endorsement; or
(ii)
any change which arises in the normal course of communication, storage and display; and
(b)
the standard of reliability required shall be assessed in the light of the purpose for which the information was generated and in the light of all the relevant circumstances.
183. (1) Where a law requires a person to produce a document or information, that requirement is met if the person produces, by means of a data message, an electronic form of
that document or information, and if
(a)
considering all the relevant circumstances at the time that the data message was sent, the method of generating the electronic form of that document provided a reliable means
of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information contained in that document; and
(b)
at the time the data message was sent, it was reasonable to expect that the information contained in it would be readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent
reference.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the integrity of the information contained in a document is maintained if the information has remained complete and unaltered, except for
Expression of intent or other statement

Attribution of electronic record and signature

(a)
the addition of any endorsement; or
(b)
any immaterial change, which arises in the normal course of communication, storage or display.
184. As between the originator and the addressee of a data message, an expression of intent or other statement is not without legal force and effect merely on the grounds that it
is
(a)
in the form of a data message; or
(b)
not evidenced by an electronic signature but by other means from which the person’s intent or other statement can be inferred.
185. (1) An electronic record or electronic signature shall be attributable to a person where it was the act of that person.
(2)
The act of a person referred to in subsection (1) may be shown in the manner set out in this section, which includes the proper application of any security procedure to determine
the person to whom the electronic record or electronic signature is attri-butable.
(3)
An electronic record is deemed to be that of the originator where it was sent
(a)

by a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that electronic record; or

(b)
by an information processing system programmed by or on behalf of the originator to operate automatically.
(4)
Subject to subsection (5), an addressee is entitled to regard an electronic record as being that of the originator and to act on that assumption where
(a)
in order to ascertain whether the electronic
record was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or
(b)
the data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that
person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify an electronic record as its own.
(5)
Subsection (4) does not apply
(a)
from the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the electronic record is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act
accordingly;
(b)
in a case referred to in subsection (4)(b), at any time when the addressee knew or ought to have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that
the electronic record was not that of the originator; or
(c)
where, in all the circumstances of the case, there are reasonable grounds for the addressee to regard the electronic record as that of the originator or to act on that
assumption.
(6)
Subject to subsection (7), where an electronic record is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or where the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption,
the addressee is entitled to regard the electronic record received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption.
(7)
The addressee is not entitled to regard the electronic record received as being what the originator intended to send where the addressee knew or ought to have known, had the
addressee
Effect of change or error

exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in an error in the electronic record as received.
(8) The addressee is entitled to regard each electronic record received as a separate electronic record and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that the addressee
duplicates another electronic record and the addressee knew or ought to have known, had the addressee exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the
electronic record was a duplicate.
186. If a change or error occurs in the transmission of an electronic record in a case where
(a)
the originator and the addressee have agreed to use an information security procedure in respect of the electronic record and one of them has conformed to the procedure, but
the other has not, and the non-conforming person would have detected the change or error had he also conformed, the conforming person may avoid the effect of the
change or erroneous electronic record;
(b)
an individual is either the originator or the addressee of the electronic record, he or she may avoid the effect of the electronic record if the error was made by the individual in
dealing with the electronic agent of another person and the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the
individual learns of the error, the individual
(i)
promptly notifies the other person of the error and that he or she did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person,
(ii)
takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other person's reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the

Acknowledgement of receipt of electronic message

other person, to return the consideration received, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record, and
(iii) has not used or received any benefit or value from the consideration, if any, received from the other person; and
(c) if paragraph (a) or (b) does not apply, the change or error shall have the effect provided for in any contract between the originator and the addressee.
187. (1) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) apply where, on or before sending an electronic record, or by means of that electronic record, the originator has requested, or agreed with, the
addressee that receipt of the electronic record be acknowledged by the addressee.
(2)
Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by
(a)

a communication by the addressee to the originator, automated or otherwise; or

(b)
the conduct of the addressee, that is reasonably sufficient to indicate to the originator, that the electronic record has been received.
(3)
Where the originator has stated that an electronic record is conditional, on receipt by him or her of an acknowledgement, the record is presumed not to have been sent until an
acknowledgment has been received by him or her.
(4)
Where the originator has not stated that the electronic record is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator
within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been
specified or agreed, within a reasonable time, the originator
(a)
may give notice to the addressee
(i)
stating that no acknowledgement has been received and that the electronic record is to be treated as though it had never been sent, or
(ii)
specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and
(b)
if the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in paragraph (a), may, on notice to the addressee
(i)
treat the electronic record as though it had never been sent, and
(ii)
exercise any other rights he or she may have.
(5)
Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt it may be presumed that the related electronic record has been received by the addressee but that
presumption does not imply that the electronic record received corresponds to the electronic record as sent.
(6)
Where the addressee’s received acknowledgement states that the related electronic record met the technical requirements that the originator and the addressee have agreed
should be met, it is presumed that the requirements have been met.
(7)
Except in so far as it relates to the sending or receipt of an electronic record, this section does not affect the legal or equitable consequences that may flow either from that
electronic record or from the acknowledgement of its receipt.
Admissibility

188. (1) In any legal proceedings, the rules of

and evidential

evidence shall not be applied so as to deny the
admissibility of a data message, in evidence

weight of data messages

(a)
on the mere grounds that it is constituted by a data message; or
(b)
if it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be expected to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its original form.
(2)
Information in the form of a data message shall be given due evidential weight.
(3)
In assessing the evidential weight of a data message, regard shall be had to
(a)
the reliability of the manner in which the data message was generated, stored or communicated;
(b)
the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the data message was maintained;
(c)
the manner in which its originator was identified; and
(d)
any other relevant factor.
(4)
A data message made by a person in the ordinary course of business, or a copy or print out of or an extract from the data message certified to be correct by an
officer in the service of the person, is on its mere production in any civil, criminal, administrative or disciplinary proceedings under any law, the rules of a self
regulatory organization or any other law or the common law, admissible in evidence against any person and rebuttable proof of the facts contained in the record,
copy, printout or extract.
Signature

189. (1) Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met in relation to a data message if
(a)
a method is used to identify that person and

to indicate that person’s approval of the information contained in the data message; and
(b)
that method is as reliable as was appropriate for the purpose for which the data message was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any
relevant agreement.
(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement in that subsection is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the absence of a
signature.
(3)An electronic signature is considered to be reliable for the purpose of satisfying the requirement referred to in subsection (1) if
(a)
the signature creation data are, within the context in which they are used, linked to the signatory and to no other person;
(b)
the signature creation data were, at the time of signing, under the control of the signatory and of no other person;
(c)
any alteration to the electronic signature, made after the time of signing, is detectable; and
(d)
where a purpose of the legal requirement for a signature is to provide assurance as to the integrity of the information to which it relates, any alteration made to that information
after the time of signing is detectable.
(4) Subsection (3) does not limit the ability of a person to
(a) establish in any other way, for the purpose of satisfying the requirement referred to in subsection (1), the reliability of an electronic signature; or

(b) adduce evidence of the non-reliability of an electronic signature.
190. (1) In determining whether, or to what extent, a certificate or an electronic signature is legally effective, no regard shall be had to
(a)
the geographic location where the
certificate is issued or the electronic
signature created or used; or
(b)
the geographic location of the place of business of the issuer or signatory.
(2)
A certificate issued outside The Gambia has the same legal effect in The Gambia as a certificate issued in The Gambia if it offers a substantially equivalent level of reliability.
(3)
An electronic signature created or used outside The Gambia has the same legal effect in The Gambia as an electronic signature created or used in The Gambia if it offers a
substantially equivalent level of reliability.
(4)
In determining whether a certificate or an electronic signature offers a substantially equivalent level of reliability for the purposes of subsection (2) or (3), regard shall be had to
recognized inter-national standards and to any other relevant factors.
(5)
Where, notwithstanding subsections (2), (3) and (4), parties agree, as between themselves, to the use of certain types of electronic signatures or certificates, that agreement shall
be recognized as sufficient for the purposes of cross-border recognition, unless that agreement would not be valid or effective under applicable law.
191. (1) Where a law requires a signature, statement or document to be notarized, acknowledged, verified or made under oath, that requirement is met if the advanced or secure
electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts is attached to, incorporated in, or logically associated
Equal treatment of signature technologies

Conduct of a person relying on an electronic signature

with, the electronic signature or data message.
(2)
Where a law requires or permits a person to provide a certified copy of a document and the document exists in electronic form, that requirement is met if the person provides a
print out certified to be a true reproduction of the document or information.
(3)
Where a law requires or permits a person to provide a certified copy of a document and the document exists in paper or other physical form, that requirement is met if an electronic
copy of the document is certified to be a true copy of the document and the certification is confirmed by the use of an advanced electronic signature.
1. Nothing in this Act, except where there is variation by agreement, shall be applied so as to exclude, restrict, or deprive of legal effect, any method of creating an electronic
signature that satisfies the requirements for compliance with the requirement for a signature, or otherwise meets the requirements of applicable law.
1. (1) Where signature creation data can be used to create a signature that has legal effect, each signatory shall
exercise
1.
reasonable care to avoid unauthorized use of its signature creation data;
without
2.
undue delay, utilize means made available by the certification service provider pursuant to the provisions of this Act, or otherwise use reasonable efforts, to
notify a person who may reasonably be expected by the signatory to rely on or to provide services in support of the electronic signature if

202. As between parties involved in generating, sending, receiving, storing, or otherwise processing data messages, any provisions relating to the formation and validity of
agreements for electronic transactions, the time and place of communications, dispatch and receipt, the expression of intent or other statement, the attribution of data messages to
the originator, or the acknowledgement of receipt of data messages, may be varied by agreement.
203 (1) Unless otherwise agreed to between the originator and the addressee of a data message, if a data message enters a single information system outside the control of the
originator, or the person who sent the message on behalf of the originator, the dispatch of the data message occurs when it enters that information system.
(2) If a data message enters successively two or more information systems outside the control of the originator, then unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the
addressee of the data message, the dispatch of the data message occurs when it enters the first of those information systems.
204.
Unless

Place otherwise
of dispatch and
receipt between the
originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows
(a)
if the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs, at the time when the data message enters the designated
information system;
(b)
if the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, receipt occurs at the time when the data message is
received by the addressee; or
(c)
if the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee.
(2) Subsection (1) applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be
received under that subsection.
205. (1) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has it’s place of business,
and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has it’s place of business.
(2) For purposes of application of subsection (1) to a data message
(a)
if the originator or addressee has more than one place of business, one of those places has a closer relation to the underlying transaction it is assumed that the place of
business is the originator’s or addressee’s only place of business;
(b)
if the originator or addressee has more than one place of business, but paragraph (a) does not apply, it is assumed that the
Information to be provided

originator’s or addressee’s principal place of business is the originator’s or addressee’s only place of business; and
