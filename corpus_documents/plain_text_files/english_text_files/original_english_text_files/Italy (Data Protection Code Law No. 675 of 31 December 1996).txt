long as this is a necessary and proportionate measure by taking account of the fundamental
rights and legitimate interests of the data subject in order to protect independency of the
judiciary and judicial proceedings.

paragraphs 2 and 3.
5. The ban shall in no case result into detrimental effects to the exercise by third parties of
property rights arising from the data subject’s decease or of the right to defend a legal claim.

subsequently amended, and legislative decree No 29 of 03.02.93, as subsequently amended, the
Bureau of the Garante shall implement the principles concerning appointment and tasks of officials
responsible for handling the individual cases and separation between guidance and supervisory
tasks as committed to the heads of the authority and managerial tasks as committed to the heads of
departments or units. The provisions of legislative decree No 165/2001 shall also apply insofar as
they are expressly referred to in this Code.

Section 156
(List of Permanent Staff and Provisions Concerning Human Resources)

1. The Bureau of the Garante shall be under the authority of a secretary general, who shall be

bodies and employees in administrative law proceedings], full professors in law and economics, and
senior heads of departments in public bodies.
2. The list of permanent staff shall include 162 positions. The list of permanent staff may only be
joined following a public competitive examination. Where this is considered helpful with a view to

recruitment of more experienced staff in connection with the public competitive examination
procedures referred to in the second sentence hereof, the Garante may reserve no more than fifty
percent of the vacancies to be filled through such procedures to permanent staff of public
administrative bodies that have been recruited via public competitive examinations and have held

amended and, in respect of heads of department, Section 19(6) and 23-a of legislative decree No

66
165 of 30 March 2001, also taking account of specific functional and organisational requirements.
Pending the general harmonisation of the salary conditions applying to independent administrative
authorities, the staff of the Garante shall be granted eighty per cent of the salary paid to the staff
employed by the Authority for Communications Safeguards; and
e) administration and accounting mechanisms, also by derogating from the provisions
applying to State accounts.
4. Personnel from the State's civil service, other public administrative bodies or public entities in
general may be employed by the Bureau for specified reasons. No more than twenty positions may
be covered in this manner, of which positions no more than twenty percent shall be heads of
department. Such personnel shall be either struck off the list of permanent staff or placed on equal
terms with the Bureau’s staff in accordance with the respective regulations; alternatively, they shall
be put on leave of absence pursuant to Section 13 of Presidential Decree No 382 of 11.07.80 as
subsequently amended. A corresponding number of vacancies shall be left available in the relevant
permanent lists.
5. In addition to the list of permanent staff, the Bureau may directly recruit employees on the basis
of time-limited contracts or hire consultants pursuant to Section 7(6) of legislative decree No
165/2001; the total number of such employees and consultants shall not be in excess of twenty.
Section 36 of legislative decree No 165/2001 shall be left unprejudiced as regards time-limited
contracts.

and after their period of employment with regard to any confidential information which has come to
their knowledge in the course of the performance of their tasks.

Articles 57(1), letter h), 58(1), letter b), and 62 of the Regulation shall act in the capacity of judicial
police officers or staff as related to the duties they are required to fulfil in accordance with the
powers respectively conferred on them.
8. Pursuant to Article 52(4) of the Regulation, the operating costs concerning the Garante including
such expenses as may be necessary to ensure participation in the cooperation and consistency
procedures as introduced by the Regulation and those relating to the human, technical and financial
resources, premises and facilities required to effectively perform its tasks and exercise the relevant
powers shall be covered by ad-hoc appropriations made in the State budget and included as specific
items in the mission and expenditures of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The accounting
statements shall be audited by the State Auditors’ Department (Corte dei Conti). The Garante may
request the controller to pay handling fees in connection with specific proceedings.

discharge its tasks, the Garante may request the controller, the processor, the controller’s or
processor’s representative, the data subject or a third party to provide information and produce
documents as also related to the contents of databases.

Section 158
(Inquiries)

or checks be carried out at the premises where the processing takes place or investigations
are to be performed that are instrumental on whatever ground to check compliance with
personal data protection law.

Article 62 of the Regulation shall be carried out by staff from the Bureau; members or staff
from the supervisory authorities of other EU Member States may participate where

discharging its institutional tasks.
4. Where the inquiries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are carried out at a person's home or in
another private dwelling place and/or the relevant appurtenances, the controller's or
processor's informed consent shall be required. Alternatively, an authorisation shall be
required from the judge presiding over the court that is competent geographically for the
place where the inquiries are to be carried out, and such authorisation shall be granted by a
reasoned decree without delay and anyhow within three days of receiving the relevant
request from the Garante if it can be proven that the inquiries cannot be postponed.
5. Subject to the safeguards referred to in paragraph 4, the inquiries carried out at the places
mentioned therein may also concern publicly available communications networks and entail
the online acquisition of data and information. To that end, specific minutes shall be drawn
whilst ensuring the right of every party to be heard if the said inquiries are carried out at the
controller’s.

68
Section 159
(Arrangements)

1. The staff in charge of the inquiries shall be provided with an ID document and may be assisted, if
necessary, by consultants bound by secrecy rules pursuant to Section 156(8). In carrying out
measurements and technical operations, said staff may also make copies of papers, data and
documents, also by samples and on computer media or else via electronic networks. Summary
minutes of the inquiries shall be drawn up, also taking note of any declarations made by the persons
attending them.
2. The entities concerned by the inquiries shall be given a copy of the authorisation issued by the
judge presiding over the competent court, if any. They shall be required to allow the inquiries to be
carried out and cooperate as necessary to that end. In case of denial, the inquiries shall be performed
in any case and the expenses incurred shall be charged to the data controller by means of the
provision finalising the relevant proceeding – which shall be regarded, as for this portion, to be an
enforcement order pursuant to Sections 474 and 475 of the Civil Procedure Code.
3. If the inquiries are carried out at the data controller’s or processor’s premises, they shall be
performed by informing either the data processor or, if the latter is absent or has not been
designated, the persons in charge of the processing. Any person that has been designated by the data
controller or processor to this effect may attend the inquiries.
4. No inquiries may be started either before 7 or after 20, except where provided otherwise in the
authorisation issued by the judge presiding over the competent court; inquiries may also be carried
out upon prior notice if this can facilitate their performance.
5. The information notices, requests and orders referred to in this Section and in Sections 157 and
158 may also be transmitted by e-mail or facsimile.
6. If the findings are such as to point to commission of an offence, Section 220 of the implementing,
coordination and transitional provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, as adopted by legislative
decree No 271 of 28.07.1989, shall apply.

Section 160
(Specific Inquiries)

1. As regards the data processing operations referred to in Section 58, the relevant inquiries shall be
carried out by the agency of a member designated by the Garante.
2. Should the processing fail to comply with the Regulation or with laws or regulations, the Garante
shall draw the data controller’s or processor’s attention to the changes and additions that are
required and verify that they are implemented. Where the request for the inquiries was made by the
data subject, the latter shall be informed of the relevant outcome unless this may be prejudicial to
actions or operations aimed at protecting public order and security or preventing and suppressing
offences, or if there exist grounds related to State defence or security.

69
3. The inquiries may not be committed to others. Where necessary on account of the specific nature
of the audit, the member designated as above may be assisted by specialized staff that shall be
bound by secrecy rules in respect of any information that has to remain confidential. All records and
documents, once acquired, shall be kept in such a way as to ensure their confidentiality and may be
disclosed to the President and members of the Garante and, where this is necessary for the
discharge of official duties, to a limited number of employees in the Office to be designated by the
Garante pursuant to criteria laid down in the regulations referred to in Section 156(3), letter a).
4. As for inquiries mentioned in paragraph 3 concerning intelligence and security bodies or data that
are covered by State secrecy, the designated member shall inspect the relevant records and
documents and report on them orally during the meetings of the Garante.

proceedings that are based on personal data processed by failing to comply with laws or regulations
shall further be regulated by the relevant procedural provisions concerning civil and criminal
matters.
