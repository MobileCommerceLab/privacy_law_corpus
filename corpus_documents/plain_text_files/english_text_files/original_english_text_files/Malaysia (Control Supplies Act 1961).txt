ACT 122

Protection of informers
29. (1) Except as hereinafter mentioned, no evidence as to any
written or oral information in respect of any offence alleged to have
been committed against this Act or any regulations made thereunder
shall be admitted in evidence in any civil or criminal proceedings
whatsoever, and no witness shall be obliged or permitted to disclose
the name or address of any informers or to state any matter which
might lead to the discovery of the identity of the informer.
(2) If any books, documents or papers which are in evidence or liable
to inspection in any civil or criminal proceedings whatsoever contain
any entry in which any informer is named or described or which might
lead to the discovery of his identity, the court shall cause all such
passages to be concealed from view or to be obliterated so far as may be
necessary to prevent the discovery of the identity of the informer, but no
further.
(3) If in any civil or criminal proceedings whatsoever the court,
after full enquiry into the case, is of the opinion that the informer
wilfully made in any information furnished by him a material
statement which he knew or believed to be false or did not believe
to be true, or the court is of the opinion that justice cannot be fully
done without the discovery of the identity of the informer, it shall be
lawful for the court to require the production of the original information,
if in writing, and to permit enquiry and require full disclosure
concerning the informer.
(4) For the purpose of this section “informer” includes every
person who is not called as a witness for the prosecution in a criminal

information, oral or documentary, in respect of any offence against
this Act alleged to have been committed by any person.
