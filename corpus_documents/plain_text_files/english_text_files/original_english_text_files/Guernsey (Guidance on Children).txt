The Law contains new provisions designed to enhance the protection of personal data
relating to a child under 13 years of age.
Where services are offered directly to a child, you must ensure that your privacy notice is
written in a clear, plain way that a child will understand. Regard must be given to the age
of the child.
Consent in the context of online processing for a child under 13 years of age must be given
or authorised by that child’s parent or guardian.

What do I need to do if I offer online services to children?
If you offer an ‘information society service’ (i.e. online service) to children, you will need to
be mindful of the age of the child.
The Law states that if consent is your basis for processing the child’s personal data, a child
under the age of 13 may not give that consent themselves and instead consent is required
from a person holding ‘parental responsibility’.
‘Information society services’ includes most internet services provided at the user’s request,
normally for remuneration. Controllers are expected to ensure that protection is particularly
significant and enhanced where children’s personal information is used for the purposes of
marketing and creating online profiles.
