Remarks of
His Excellency Ang Vong Vathana
Minister of Justice
This Criminal Procedure Code is the result of almost 10-year work of the Ministry of Justice
which was prepared with assistance of French Cooperation. Since 1994, the Ministry of Justice has
started reviewing criminal procedures to meet the needs of Cambodia for a clear and comprehensive
criminal procedure code because criminal procedures are fundamental legal texts and are important
instruments of the criminal court.
In the preparation of the code, it is necessary to compile the scattered texts so that they
become unified and consistent which make it easy to understand. The Ministry of Justice adheres to
the principles of the Law dated 8 March 1993 on Criminal Procedures which aim to ensure the
institutional continuity in accordance with legal tradition of the Kingdom of Cambodia and to provide
the investigating judges with major roles during investigation and evidence collection stages. This
Code clearly provides the principles to ensure the effectiveness in pursuing the perpetrators, the
prosecution and trial as well as the respect of freedom of individual in accordance with the principles
provided in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia and international conventions to which the
Kingdom of Cambodia is a party such as the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the 1966
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
This Criminal Procedure Code was adopted by the National Assembly with 83/83 votes on 7
June 2007 and adopted by the Senate with 51/51 votes on 24 July 2007. The adoption of the Code is
an evidence of achievement of the legal framework building in line with the legal and judicial reform
policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia under the supreme leadership of Samdech Prime Minister Hun
Sen.
Now, almost every citizen in the Cambodian society understands that it is necessary for
everybody to be aware of the rules of law in order to ensure the effectiveness of their enforcement
because modern societies need awareness raising and dissemination of laws so as to maintain and
ensure peace and safety for business operations nationally and internationally. When myself and
colleagues of the Ministry of Justice representing the Royal Government defended the draft Criminal
Procedure Code at the National Assembly at its 6th session of the 3rd legislature, there were
numerous members of the National Assembly raised the importance and necessity of legal education
and dissemination to ensure the effectiveness of enforcement and they requested the Ministry of
Justice to provide broad education and dissemination of this Code to law enforcement officers and
citizens.
It is true that regular publication of legal texts when they are approved is a stage which
allows the building of a democratic system and a rule of law in accordance with the spirit of the
Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
Seeing the necessity and importance of legal education and dissemination to ensure the
effectiveness of law enforcement, raise the awareness of citizens and strengthen the rule of law, the
Ministry of Justice which is the executing agency of the Royal Government in this area publishes this
Criminal Procedure Code with support from French Cooperation for broad distribution to legal and
court professionals and law enforcement officers.
2

The Ministry of Justice strongly believes that this Criminal Procedure Code will become an
important instrument for legal training, education and dissemination which contributes to
promoting access to legal information and access to justice in the Kingdom of Cambodia.

Forewords
We would like to invite all kinds of holy spirits and objects such as the spirits of Preah Ang

Moeung, Neak Ta Kraham Kor, Lok Ta Dambong Dek, Lok Ta Dambong Kranhong, Lok Yeay Tep,

the witnesses who have known, seen, and heard and still remember the facts and the law requires
the witnesses to testify to reflect the facts.
Those who fail to testify in accordance with what they have known, seen, heard and
remembered, we beg the holy spirits and objects to destroy him/her and he/she is miserly killed by
bullets, electrocution, lightning, tiger attack, snake bite and his/her future lives will face with
separation from parents, brothers or sisters, children and become extremely poor for five hundred
live-cycles.
Those who honestly, accurately and impartially testify regardless of relatives and refrain
from conspiring because of fear, hatred, interests and bribes, we wish the spirits to grant him/her
with the longevity, good health, richness, well respected and love and in the future lives, he/she will
enjoy good lives and prosperity.

Swearing Words
I will speak only the truth, nothing but the truth in accordance with what I have known,
seen, heard and remembered.
If I do not speak the truth for any reason, I beg the holy spirits and objects to destroy me and
be miserably killed, but when I speak the truth, I wish the spirits to let me live in prosperity with lots
of friends and relatives forever.
