PART 1
INTRODUCTION

1.0

Foreword

1.1

The Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (“the Act”) was passed by the Parliament of
Malaysia for the purpose of regulating the processing of personal data in commercial
transactions. The Act came into force on 15 November 2013. The Act confers rights
on individuals (“Data Subjects”) in relation to the collection, use and/or retention
(“processing”) of their personal data, and places obligations on those
persons/entities processing the same (“Data Users”). The terms “Data Subject”,
“Data User” and “processing” are more fully defined in Part 2 of this Code of
Practice.

1.2

The Act is built around a core of personal data protection principles which state in
broad terms the types of conduct that are permitted under the Act.

1.3

In recognition of the fact that separate sectors/industries may have specific industry
practices in relation to the manner in which personal data is handled and/or may
have deployed unique technologies which require specific data protection rules, the
Act permits the formation and designation by the Commissioner of data user forums,
and the preparation of codes of practice for specific sectors/industries.
DRAFT

1.4

This Code of Practice is specific to the persons/parties that hold licences under the
Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, and has been developed by the Personal
Data User Forum for Communications and Multimedia Act Licensees (“CMA Data
User Forum”). For the avoidance of doubt, this Code applies to both individual and
class licensees under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, but does not
extend to those parties that have been exempted from holding a licence under the
Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 and its regulations.

2.0

Objectives of the Code

2.1

This Code of Practice (“Code”) is intended to:(i)

(ii)

(iii)

set standards of conduct in respect of personal data that are expected of a
particular class of Data Users (as defined in Part 2), namely individual and
class licensees under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998;
serve as a guide to Data Users in order to ensure that the processing of
personal data does not infringe a Data Subject’s (as defined in Part 2) rights
under the Act; and
serve as a guide to Data Users to set effective standards and measures in
relation to the processing of a Data Subject’s personal data.

PART 3
GENERAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO THE DATA USER
AND DATA SUBJECT RELATIONSHIP
1.0

GENERAL PRINCIPLE
Consent

1.1

Data Users are required to obtain consent from Data Subjects except as provided in
1.2 below.

1.2

Data Users are permitted to process personal data without obtaining the consent of
Data Subjects where the processing is necessary for the following purposes:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

(v)

the performance of a contract entered into with a Data Subject; or
in addressing any pre-contractual inquiry of a Data Subject who is a potential
customer; or
in order to comply with any non-contractual legal obligation that the Data
User is subject to; or
in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject (e.g. disclosing the
last known location of the Data Subject where he/she has been reported
missing for more than 24 hours); or
for the administration of justice in accordance with the requirements and
processes as set out by the law; or
for the exercise of any functions conferred upon any person by the law; or
where expressly exempted or otherwise permitted by the Act.
DRAFT

(vi)
(vii)

Form and Type of Consent
1.3

Where consent needs to be obtained from Data Subjects, the form and type of
consent that needs to be obtained prior to processing personal data has not been
specified in the Act. However, the Regulations provide that consent needs to be
capable of being "recorded" and "maintained". As such, subject to the foregoing,
consent may be express or implied.

1.4

Without limiting the same, forms of consent acceptable under the Act for the
purpose of commencing or continuing a contract between the Data User and the
Data Subject are:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

signatures or ticks indicating consent; or
opt-in or opt-out consent; or
verbal consent; or
consent by conduct/performance,

subject to fulfilment of the requirements of the Regulations as to consent being
capable of being “recorded” and “maintained”.
10

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

1.5

Where applicable, consent may be obtained either on paper or on electronic
mediums utilised by Data Users including but not limited to electronic channels such
as SMS, e-mail and other internet / social / application based messaging systems.

1.6

It is recommended that where verbal consent is being recorded, the said consent will
need to be recorded either digitally (e.g. via the use of call logger and recorder
software) or by issuing a communication to the Data Subject confirming the verbal
consent given (e.g. via the issuance of a letter, e-mail or SMS to the Data Subject).

1.7

In the context of principal and supplemental subscription accounts held by individual
persons, the sufficiency of consent secured by the Data User would be dependent on
the contract/documentation between the Data User and Data Subject. It shall be
sufficient for purposes of compliance with the Act for Data Users to secure consent
from the primary/principal Subscriber who executes the application or registration
form encompassing both the principal and supplemental subscription accounts.
However, where Data Users require the supplementary subscription account holder
to execute a separate application or registration form, the consent of the
primary/principal Subscriber will be insufficient to meet the consent requirement in
the Act.

1.8

In the context of the relationship between Data Users and their corporate / business
clientele that are legal entities, it shall be sufficient for purposes of compliance with
the Act for Data Users to secure consent from the authorised representative of the
legal entity for and on behalf of all individual subscribers from the said legal entity,
regardless of whether the authorised representative is an individual subscriber or
not.
DRAFT

1.9

For the avoidance of doubt, any consent given to a Data User by the authorised
representatives of the Data Subject, including but not limited to the holders of any
power of attorney, trustees, guardians or personal representatives, shall bind the
respective Data Subject.
Processing Personal Data

1.10

Other than the issue of consent, the Act also sets out parameters for the processing
of personal data, wherein personal data shall not be processed unless:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

1.11

the personal data is processed for a lawful purpose directly related to an
activity of the Data User;
the processing of personal data is necessary for or directly related to that
purpose; and
the personal data is adequate but not excessive in relation to that purpose.

The criteria set out above are to be read conjunctively.

11

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

1.12

In the context of 1.10 of Part 3, directly above and this Code:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

1.13

“directly related to that purpose” means a purpose closely associated to the
primary purpose;
“necessary for … that purpose” means without which the Data User would be
unable to achieve the purpose; and
“adequate but not excessive” means just enough to enable the Data User to
achieve the purpose, and no more.

To comply with the Act, a Data User is required to ensure that the personal data
sought and held is:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

relevant in relation to the purpose(s) for which it has been collected;
adequate in relation to the purpose(s) for which it has been collected; and
not excessive in relation to the purpose(s) for which it has been collected.

1.14

The purpose or purposes for which a Data User collects and holds personal data of a
Data Subject is required to be reflected in the Data User’s Privacy Notice.

2.0

NOTICE AND CHOICE PRINCIPLE

2.1

Data Users are required to bring to the attention of Data Subjects their Privacy
Notice, prior to or as soon as reasonably practicable, when collecting and processing
their personal data. A template Privacy Notice is set out at Schedule 1 for reference
purposes.
DRAFT

2.2

In essence, the Privacy Notice is a publicly available statement clearly expressing the
privacy practices of how a Data User uses, manages, discloses and provides Data
Subjects with access to personal data collected by the said Data User. It is a general
non-exhaustive statement about the privacy practices of the Data User that should
result in Data Subjects having greater confidence in the manner the Data User deals
with their personal data.
Content of the Privacy Notice

2.3

The Notice and Choice Principle specifically requires Data Users to provide Data
Subjects with a notice stating:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

that personal data of the Data Subject is being processed by the Data User
and providing the Data Subject with a description of the personal data being
processed by the Data User;
the purpose(s) for which the personal data is being collected and processed;
the source of the personal data;
the Data Subject’s right to access and correct the personal data and the
contact details to which a Data Subject may send the Data Access and/or
Correction Request;
12

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

(v)
(vi)
(vii)
(viii)

the class of third parties the personal data is disclosed or may be disclosed to;
the choices and means available to the Data Subject to limit the processing of
his/her personal data;
whether it is obligatory or voluntary for the Data Subject to provide the
personal data; and
the consequences of failing to provide obligatory personal data (i.e. personal
data required by the Data User to make the services available to the Data
Subject).

2.4

Where the Data User is an entity within a group of companies or a related
corporation, it is permissible for the Privacy Notice to be issued by the group of
companies instead, particularly in instances where there is shared infrastructure,
back-end systems and operations. However, should an entity within a group of
companies or a related corporation have its own Privacy Notice, the entity’s Privacy
Notice will override the Privacy Notice of the group of companies.

2.5

In cases where the Privacy Notice indicates that the personal data collected is to be
disclosed to merchants and strategic partners for purposes other than the fulfilment
of a contract between the Data User and the Data Subject (e.g. marketing), Data
Users are required to provide Data Subjects with an option to opt-out of such
disclosures. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not in any way preclude Data
Users from providing an opt-in choice to Data Subjects.

2.6

The Privacy Notice needs to be provided in Bahasa Malaysia and English. Data Users
may specify which version of the Privacy Notice will override the other in the event
of a conflict in interpretation.
DRAFT

Communicating the Privacy Notice
2.7

The Privacy Notice is to be communicated by the Data User to the Data Subject
either when the personal data is first collected, when the Data User first requests
the Data Subject for the personal data, or as soon as practicable thereafter.

2.8

Data Users may communicate the Privacy Notice to Data Subjects by one or more of
the following methods:
(i)
(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

by posting the Privacy Notice on the website of the Data User; or
by sending a message to Data Subjects with a website address / link to the
Privacy Notice and/or a telephone number in order to request for the Privacy
Notice and/or further information; or
by issuing an e-mail to Data Subjects with a website address / link to the Data
User’s Privacy Notice and/or telephone number to contact for further
information; or
by inserting a summary notice in regular communications with Data Subjects
(e.g. in monthly billing statements) with a website address / link to the
Privacy Notice and/or a telephone number to contact for in order to request
for the Privacy Notice and/or further information; or
13

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

(v)
(vi)

(vii)
(viii)

by inserting the Privacy Notice in application/registration forms; or
by inserting a statement in application/registration forms referencing the
Privacy Notice, which may be accessed at a given website address, or by
making a request to the personnel of the Data User, or by calling a telephone
number provided in the application/registration form; or
by printing out copies of the Privacy Notice and providing it to Data Subjects
at the Data User’s premises; or
any other recordable methods or means of delivery to Data Subjects as may
be available or be adopted by Data Users.

2.9

Data Users are required by the Regulations to maintain records of having
communicated the Privacy Notice to Data Subjects. The maintenance of the evidence
of a process of communicating the Data Users’ Privacy Notice to its Data Subjects
shall be sufficient to fulfil this requirement.

2.10

For the avoidance of doubt, each time the Data Subject utilises the Data User’s
services/facilities and is provided the Data User’s Privacy Notice by way of any of the
modes identified in 2.8 above, the Privacy Notice shall be deemed to have been
communicated afresh to the Data Subject.

2.11

Proof of the Privacy Notice having been delivered, received and/or accepted by the
Data Subject is not required under the Act.
DRAFT

3.0

DISCLOSURE PRINCIPLE

3.1

Data Users will only disclose the Data Subject’s personal data pursuant to the terms
of its Privacy Notice, the relevant provisions under the Act and/or such other
applicable laws that the respective Data User is subject to.

3.2

A Data User can be taken to have “disclosed” personal data when it releases,
communicates or disseminates the personal data of the Data Subject to third parties,
whether intentionally or otherwise. The communication of the personal data may be
in written or verbal form.
Permitted Disclosures

3.3

The Disclosure Principle provides that Data Users may disclose personal data to third
parties where:
(i)

the disclosure is for the purpose declared at the point of the collection of the
personal data as stated in the Data User’s Privacy Notice; or

14

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

Example:
A Data Subject provides his/her information for the purpose of subscribing to
telecommunication services. As a part of the process of activating the
telecommunication service, the Subscriber’s personal data needs to be
provided to a third party to whom the Data User has outsourced a part of its
operations (subject to technical and organizational security measures being in
place in order to ensure the security of the personal data).

(ii)

the disclosure is for a purpose directly related to the purpose declared in the
Privacy Notice at the point of the collection of the personal data (i.e. a
purpose closely associated to the primary purpose); or
Example:
A Data Subject defaults on his/her bills. The Data User discloses the relevant
particulars of the Data Subject and his/her debt to a solicitor / debt collection
agent to recover the amounts outstanding.

(iii)

the disclosure is being made to a third party mentioned in the Privacy Notice
or to a class or category of third parties as identified in the Privacy Notice;
DRAFT

Examples:




Organizations that assist in fulfilling the transactions requested by the
Data Subject.
Parties authorised by the Data Subject (e.g. auditors, financial advisers).
Merchants and strategic partners of Data Users.
Credit reference agencies.

3.4

Data Users are to note that the Regulations require Data Users to maintain a listing
of the disclosures made to the various classes/categories of third parties, other than
those classes/categories of third parties detailed in their respective Privacy Notices.

3.5

Other than the disclosures permitted based on the Privacy Notice as detailed in 3.3
above, the Act provides that Data Users may disclose personal data of Data Subjects
should the following circumstances arise:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

the disclosure has been consented to by the Data Subject; or
the disclosure is necessary for the purpose of preventing or detecting a crime,
or for the purpose of investigations; or
the disclosure is required or authorized by or under any law or by the order
of a court; or

3.6

the Data User acted in the reasonable belief that it had in law the right to
disclose the personal data to the other person; or
the Data User acted in the reasonable belief that it would have had the
consent of the Data Subject if the Data Subject had known of the disclosure
of the personal data and the circumstances of such disclosure; or
the Minister determines the disclosure as being justified in the public
interest.

For the sake of completeness, Data Users are to note that the processing of personal
data in certain instances have been excluded from compliance with the Disclosure
Principle. These instances are briefly highlighted here:
(i)

where personal data is processed for the prevention or detection of crime or
for the purpose of investigations; or
where personal data is processed for the apprehension or prosecution of
offenders; or
where personal data is processed for the assessment or collection of any tax
or duty or any other imposition of a similar nature; or
where personal data is processed for the preparation of statistics or carrying
out research (subject to the personal data not being processed for any other
purpose and the resulting statistics or the results of the research being
anonymised); or
where personal data is processed for the purpose of or in connection with
any order or judgment of a court; or
where personal data is processed for the purpose of discharging regulatory
functions; or
where personal data is processed for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes.

Requests for Personal Data
3.7

In instances where Data Users receive requests from third parties for the disclosure
of personal data, Data Users shall only disclose the requested personal data in the
circumstances identified in 3.3 to 3.6.

3.8

In instances where requests for disclosure of personal data are directed to Data
Users pursuant to a request of the police or any other investigating authority, or
where the disclosure is required or authorized by or under any law or by an order of
court, Data Users are required to:
(i)
(ii)

only release the requested personal data on a formal written request being
made, citing the relevant legal basis of the request being so made; and
wherever appropriate, set conditions stipulating the permitted use of the
personal data and its return or destruction upon the conclusion of the
purpose of the requestor.

4.0

SECURITY PRINCIPLE

4.1

The Act does not prescribe the specific measures that need to be taken to secure the
personal data within the control of Data Users, but instead requires Data Users to
take “practical steps” to protect personal data from “any loss, misuse, modification,
unauthorized or accidental access or disclosure, alteration or destruction”.

4.2

What these “practical steps” amount to in real terms will vary from case to case,
depending on the nature of personal data being processed by the Data User in
question and the degree of sensitivity attached to the personal data or harm that the
Data Subject might suffer due to its loss, misuse, modification, unauthorized or
accidental access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.

4.3

The Act however does prescribe the elements that Data Users need to take into
consideration when determining what practical measures need to be taken when
securing their Data Subject’s personal data. The prescribed elements are:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
4.4

the nature of the personal data and the harm that would result from such
loss, misuse, modification, unauthorized or accidental access or disclosure,
alteration or destruction;
the place or location where the personal data is stored;
any security measures incorporated into any equipment in which the
personal data is stored;
the measures taken for ensuring the reliability, integrity and competence of
personnel having access to the personal data; and
the measures taken for ensuring the secure transfer of the personal data.
DRAFT

The elements prescribed above are intended to keep personal data secure and as
such apply to all Data Users.
Technical and Organizational Security Measures

4.5

The following technical and organizational security measures may be considered by
Data Users and implemented wherever Data Users are of the view that it is required
or appropriate, such as, data classification policy, access control policy,
confidentiality guidelines, technical security measures, anti-virus and anti-malware
software, back-ups and encryptions. Descriptions of these technical and
organizational security measures are set out below:-

17

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

(i)

Organizational Security Measures
(a) Data classification policy – Personal data being processed by each Data
User should ideally be categorised based on the sensitivity of the personal
data and the harm that could arise vis-à-vis the Data Subject should the
personal data be mishandled. The policy should identify the specific
categories of personal data, the security measures associated with each
of the said categories of personal data, both in physical and electronic
formats.
(b) Access control policy – Personal data should be accessed by personnel of
the Data User based on a “need to know” basis. Putting an access control
policy in place will assist in this regard as the policy will indicate the
various levels of personnel that are permitted access, modification and/or
deletion rights in relation to different categories of personal data. It is
recommended that access control policies should be supplemented with
policies limiting access to technologies that allow personal data to be
transferred out of the Data User’s organization (as detailed further under
technical security measures), and the activation of audit logs which
enable authorised and unauthorised access to personal data to be traced.
(c) Confidentiality guidelines – It is recommended that guidelines in respect
of the confidentiality of Data Subject information be issued (either
separately or as part of the employee handbook) to all personnel of Data
Users in order to make clear the fundamental importance of
confidentiality and the role that it plays in establishing confidence and
market credibility in the branding of the Data User. Further to this, it is
recommended that employment contracts of Data Users explicitly state
the obligation of maintaining the confidentiality of Data Subject
information, and where there has been a breach of the same, Data Users
need to be seen to have taken the necessary action in order that
personnel are aware of how seriously Data Users take this issue.
DRAFT

(ii)

Technical Security Measures
(a) Physical document security – Physical documents such as service
application forms, copies of identity documents, letters, need to be
received, processed and stored securely.
(b) Physical access to IT facilities – Access to IT facilities where the IT
infrastructure (such as servers, networks, routers) and the
telecommunications infrastructure (exchanges and junction boxes) of
Data Users are located, needs to be controlled at all times. This can be
achieved through the use of security guards for perimeter and location
security, escorts in order to allow guests into the IT facility, tags to

18

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

identify authorised personnel, card / biometric based access systems to
regulate access, and the use of CCTVs for overall monitoring.
(c) Physical access to IT systems and communications equipment – Access
to IT systems within Data Users’ offices or premises such as PCs, tablets,
printers and fax machines needs to controlled at all times as personal
data may be stored and/or displayed on them. This can be achieved by
restricting physical access to any non-authorised personnel, careful
positioning of PCs in order to ensure that screens are not viewable by
non-authorised personnel, the utilisation of screen savers for unattended
PCs, and locked printer and/or fax rooms which are accessible only to
authorised personnel.
(d) Back-ups –Data Users should back-up the personal data resident on their
systems in order to guard against data loss. The media on which the backups are resident should be stored off-site to prevent their loss together
with the primary systems in the event of a major disaster.
(e) Anti-virus and anti-malware software - Data Users would be required to
install and regularly update their anti-virus software in order to avoid
putting the personal data of Data Subjects at risk consequent to virus
infections and other malware. Personnel should be restricted from
downloading and installing applications that have not been approved by
the IT department of the Data User as it may introduce malware which
may put personal data at risk.
DRAFT

(f) Securing access - All personal data that is removed from the premises of
the Data User with authorisation, whether on notebooks, tablets, smart
phones, USB thumb drives, portable hard drives, are to be secured in
order to prevent the personal data stored on the said devices being
accessed without authorisation in the event the said devices being stolen
or lost. E-mails attaching personal data are also to be secured in order to
prevent the personal data being accessed by unauthorised third parties.
4.6

Upon due consideration, Data Users may choose not to put any of the organizational
or technical security measures mentioned above in place. In such cases, Data Users
are required to put into place alternative mechanisms that address the risk of loss,
misuse, modification, unauthorized or accidental access or disclosure, alteration or
destruction of personal data.

19

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

Data Processors
4.7

The Security Principle also addresses the processing of personal data by data
processors for and on behalf of Data Users.

4.8

Typically, data processors are third parties such as outsourcing service providers or
any vendors (including but not limited to security, transportation, accounting, postal
service providers) that are appointed to process the personal data of Data Subjects
for and on behalf of the Data User alone. In this context, the word “process” should
be interpreted as per the definition in the Act.

4.9

The Security Principle permits the processing of personal data by data processors,
but requires the Data User to take certain minimum measures in order to ensure
that the personal data of Data Subject is not subject to the risk of loss, misuse,
modification, unauthorized or accidental access or disclosure, alteration or
destruction. These measures include:
(i)

(ii)

the data processor giving the Data User “sufficient guarantees in respect of
the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing
to be carried out”; and
the Data User taking “reasonable steps to ensure compliance with those
measures”.

4.10

Data Users are required to utilise reasonable efforts to raise and negotiate the
technical and organizational security measures required by the Data User from the
data processor for the purposes of fulfilling the Security Principle. Data Users should
determine in each case which of the technical and organizational security measures
apply to the data processor.

4.11

It is recommended that Data Users use their reasonable efforts to ensure that their
agreement with data processors (whether in the form of a contract or letter or
otherwise) addresses the following matters:

DRAFT

(i)

(ii)

(iii)
(iv)
(v)

the data processor’s undertaking to ensure that neither itself nor its
employees disclose the personal data to any third party without the
authorisation of the Data User;
the data processor’s undertaking to deploy the agreed technical and
organizational security measures, as well as the obligation to inform the Data
User should any of the measures be breached;
the data processor’s undertaking to otherwise conduct itself in such a
manner so as to not cause the Data User to breach the Act;
the obligation of the data processor to return all the personal data upon
expiry or termination of the agreement term; and
the right of the Data User to conduct an audit (on-site or via questionnaire) of
the technical and organizational security measures should it so require.

20

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

4.12

Data Users should note that data processors may be based either locally or abroad,
and should adjust their agreements or binding letters or any other relevant
documentation appropriately.
Commissioner’s Security Standards

4.13

Data Users are required to also comply with any security standards as may be set out
by the Commissioner from time to time.

4.14

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a conflict between the Commissioner’s
security standard, this Code, any security standard(s) (or their equivalent) set by the
Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission or such other regulators of
the Data User and/or any security standard(s) (or their equivalent) prescribed by the
law, the document setting the higher standard will prevail to the extent of the
conflict.

5.0

RETENTION PRINCIPLE

5.1

The Act places a responsibility on Data Users to hold personal data only for as long as
necessary for the fulfilment of the purpose. The Act also provides that upon the
purpose being fulfilled, Data Users are required to permanently destroy/delete the
personal data. This requirement applies to both physical and electronic copies of
documents containing personal data.
DRAFT

5.2

For the avoidance of doubt, the Act does not override other applicable statutory
provisions that require the retention of data/records/information for a specified
minimum duration, for instance, the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, the
Companies Act 1965, Income Tax Act 1967, Employment Act 1955 or the Limitation
Act 1953. The Act and such other applicable legislation must be read together.
Applicable Retention Periods

5.3

This Code does not specify the applicable durations that personal data may be
retained for but leaves it to the discretion of Data Users.

5.4

In order to assist Data Users to keep track of the various retention periods as may be
applicable to the various types of personal data processed by them, Data Users are
required to consolidate all applicable retention periods into the Data User’s relevant
retention policies which addresses the various categories of personal data, for
example:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

Application forms
Unsuccessful applications
Call records
Customer audio recordings
Defaulting customers
21

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

5.5

There may be certain instances in which Data Users need to retain personal data
beyond a specified statutory period. In these cases, Data Users should be able to
demonstrate a reasonable need to retain personal data beyond the applicable
statutory period and (if available) provide evidence of their adherence to the same.
The commencement of legal proceedings or investigations concerning the Data
Subject would qualify as grounds for continuing to retain the personal data until the
disposal/closure of the matter and the expiry of the retention period specific to the
matter itself.

5.6

For the avoidance of doubt, the Retention Principle does not apply to backup and
electronic archival data subject to the Data User restricting access to the same to
authorised personnel only and for backup or archival purposes respectively.
Destruction / Permanent Deletion of Personal Data

5.7

The Act requires the “destruction” (applicable to physical / paper based personal
data) and “permanent deletion” (applicable to electronic personal data) of personal
data once the conditions of disposal are met.

5.8

For the avoidance of doubt, Data Users are to note that personal data that is
physically archived is still subject to the provisions of the Act and will continue to
remain so until it is destroyed, permanently deleted or anonymized. Bearing in mind
the volume of records containing personal data that are required to be destroyed,
permanently deleted or anonymized, Data Users shall be permitted a period of five
(5) years from the effective date of this Code to ensure that the necessary measures
are adopted in respect of their physical archives.
DRAFT

5.9

Further, Data Users are to note that where data is held in electronic archives and/or
in electronic/tape backup media, the said data shall not be subject to the Act for so
long as the Data User restricts access to the data to authorised personnel only and
for backup or archival purposes respectively. In instances where the personal data
relate to accounts that are active or to data that has been reinstated from the
backups or the electronic archives of the Data User, Data Users are required to fully
comply with the Act and Code.

5.10

As an alternative to destroying or permanently deleting the personal data, Data User
can also consider the process of turning the personal data into anonymised data.
Where properly anonymized, the anonymized data will not fall within the ambit of
the definition of “personal data” as it is unlikely to allow any individual to be
identified through its combination with other data.

22

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

Commissioner’s Retention Standards
5.11

Data Users are required to comply with any retention standards as may be set out by
the Commissioner from time to time.

5.12

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a conflict between the Commissioner’s
retention standard, this Code, any retention standard(s) (or their equivalent) set by
the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission or such other
regulators of the Data User and/or any retention standard(s) (or their equivalent)
prescribed by the law, the document setting the higher standard will prevail to the
extent of the conflict.

6.0

DATA INTEGRITY PRINCIPLE

6.1

The Act provides that a Data User is to take “reasonable steps” to ensure that the
personal data processed by the Data User is “accurate, complete, not misleading and
kept up-to-date”, in relation to the purpose.

6.2

By way of illustration, the Act requires a Data User to take reasonable steps in order
to ensure that the personal data processed in relation to a Data Subject is:
(i)

accurate / correct (meaning that the personal data is captured without any
inaccuracies, such as erroneously recording the Data Subject’s agreement to
receive direct marketing materials for other products of the Data User);
complete (meaning that information in relation to the Data Subject has not
been omitted, which for example may lead the Data User to make an
unfavourable decision in relation to a Data Subject’s application for services);
not misleading (meaning that the personal data processed by the Data User
should not - through error, omission, oversight, etc. - result in an inaccurate
or false reflection of the status of the Data Subject); and
kept up-to-date (meaning the personal data of the Data Subject should reflect
the latest information as provided by the Data Subject).
DRAFT

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

6.3

What amounts to “reasonable steps” will differ from case to case, depending on the
circumstances of each case as well as on the purpose and directly related purposes
that the personal data was obtained for and the frequency of communications with
the Data Subject.

6.4

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Data Users are entitled to treat the personal data
provided by Data Subjects as accurate, complete, not misleading and up-to-date.
Data Users are not required to verify the accuracy and completeness of the personal
data provided by Data Subjects, provided that the Data Users have established
appropriate processes or mechanisms so that inaccuracies in personal data which
are material (such as inaccuracies in relation to account or contact information) may
be corrected.

23

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

6.5

The Act shall not override any agreement between the Data User and Data Subject
which specifies that it shall be the duty of the Data Subject to inform the Data User
of any change to the Data Subject’s information (such as a new address or telephone
number), and the Data User shall not be found to be in breach of the Data Integrity
Principle where the Data User has not been so informed by the Data Subject.
Nevertheless, Data Users are required to provide regular reminders to Data Subjects
to update their personal data, whether as part of regular communications or
otherwise.

6.6

Similarly, where the Data User provides a self-update facility to the Data Subject
which permits the Data Subject to update his/her personal data, the Data User shall
not be found to have breached the Data Integrity Principle should the Data User act
based on the wrong personal data provided by the Data Subject.

6.7

For the avoidance of doubt, the following are not breaches of the Data Integrity
Principle:
(i)

(ii)

maintenance of personal data which is historical in nature (for example, the
previous address that the Data Subject used to reside at when he/she
commenced subscribing to the communications service by the Data User),
subject to the same being accurate; and
maintenance of personal data that records events that happened in error,
subject to those records not being misleading about the facts (for instance
where a Data Subject’s subscription was wrongfully terminated but has since
been reinstated, the Data User would be permitted to retain the said records
as it accurately reflects the error on the part of the Data User).
DRAFT

Commissioner’s Data Integrity Standards
6.8

Data Users are required to comply with any data integrity standards as may be set
out by the Commissioner from time to time.

6.9

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a conflict between the Commissioner’s
data integrity standard, this Code, any data integrity standard(s) (or their equivalent)
set by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission or such other
regulators of the Data User and/or any data integrity standard(s) (or their
equivalent) prescribed by the law, the document setting the higher standard will
prevail to the extent of the conflict.

7.0

ACCESS PRINCIPLE

7.1

The Act provides Data Subjects with the right:
(i)
(ii)

to request access to his/her personal data held by Data Users; and/or
to correct his/her personal data where the personal data is inaccurate,
incomplete, misleading or not up-to-date,

unless the request is one which Data Users may deny as stated in the Act.
7.2

Data Users are obliged to respond accordingly to these data access and data
correction requests within fixed timelines as detailed in Part 5, in order to remain
compliant with the Act subject to 7.3 below.

7.3

Data Users have the right not to comply with a data access request where Data
Users:
(i)

(ii)

have not been supplied with sufficient information (as reasonably required,
i.e. name, identification card number, address, and such other related
information as the Commissioner may determine) in order to establish the
requestor’s identity, establish the identity of the Data Subject, or establish
the requestor’s connection to the Data Subject; or
have not been supplied with sufficient information as they may reasonably
require to locate the personal data to which the data access request relates;
or
are unable to comply with the data access request without disclosing another
person’s personal data (unless the other person has consented to the
disclosure of the personal data to the requestor); or
are of the view that the burden or expense of providing access is
disproportionate to the risks to the Data Subject’s privacy in relation to the
personal data requested for via the data access request; or
are at risk of violating a court order should they provide access to the Data
Subject or requestor; or
are of the view that that providing access would disclose confidential
commercial information of the Data User; or
have not received the fees for making a data access request as per the
Personal Data Protection (Fees) Regulation 2013 (where and if required by
the Data User).

out research (subject to the personal data not being processed for any other
purpose and the resulting statistics or the results of the research being
anonymised); or
where personal data is processed for the purpose of or in connection with
any order or judgment of a court; or
where personal data is processed for the purpose of discharging regulatory
functions; or
where personal data is processed for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes.

PART 4
SPECIFIC ISSUES RELEVANT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CMA DATA USER FORUM

1.0

PERSONAL DATA

1.1

Data Users process a substantial amount of data in their day-to-day operations.
Some of this data can be considered to be personal data, while other data cannot be
considered to be personal data due to it not meeting one or more requirements of
the Act.

1.2

For the purpose of clarity, the following types of data fall outside the ambit of the
Act and are therefore not considered to be “personal data”:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

1.3

Data relating to organizations
Data relating to deceased individuals
Data pertaining to individuals that have been aggregated and/or anonymised
in such a manner as to render the individual non-identifiable
Data that is electronically archived and/or backed up

In so far as organizations / companies are concerned, the information of their
officers, employees, authorised signatories, directors, individual shareholders,
individual guarantors, suppliers/vendors and/or related parties are provided by the
said organizations/companies to Data Users for the purpose of securing subscription
accounts or such other facilities from the said Data Users, the said information shall
be treated as information that the said organization / company is authorised to
provide to the Data User.
DRAFT

1.4

For the avoidance of doubt, Data Users are not required to obtain consent from the
said officers, employees, authorised signatories, directors, individual shareholders,
individual guarantors, suppliers/vendors and/or related parties, in order to process
said information for the purpose of the organization / company securing subscription
accounts or such other facilities or products from the said Data Users.

1.5

However, in instances where the Data User utilises the data of the officers,
employees, authorised signatories, directors, individual shareholders, individual
guarantors, suppliers/vendors and/or related parties of the company / organization
for a commercial purpose not related to the company / organization (for example,
offering an employee of a company one or more telecommunication / broadcast
subscription services in his personal capacity), the said officers, employees,
authorised signatories, directors, individual shareholders, individual guarantors,
suppliers/vendors and/or related parties shall be considered to be Data Subjects and
shall be entitled to rights under the Act.

27

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

2.0

SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA

2.1

The Act defines Sensitive Personal Data as “any personal data consisting of
information as to the physical or mental health or condition of a data subject, his
political opinions, his religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, the
commission or alleged commission by him of any offence or any other personal data
as the Minister may determine by order published in the Gazette”.

2.2

In the context of providing communication services to Data Subjects, certain
Sensitive Personal Data may be collected by the Data User, as per the example
below.
Example:
The collection or the scanning of copies of a customer’s identification card which
indicates the religion of the said customer (either expressly for Muslims or by
implication for non-Muslims).

2.3

Section 40 of the Act provides that a Data User shall not process the Sensitive
Personal Data of a Data Subject, unless the Data Subject has given his/her “explicit
consent” or where, for example, the processing is necessary for:
DRAFT

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
2.4

the purpose of any legal proceedings; or
the purpose of obtaining legal advice; or
establishing, exercising or defending the Data User’s legal rights.

In the context of Data Users, the collection of NRIC information is central to the
opening of accounts for customers of Data Users and for the on-going management
of their subscriptions. Frequently, this takes the form of photocopying or scanning
the entire NRIC and returning the original to the customers, while the copy is
retained in physical or electronic format by the Data User. Where this is done, the
Data User concerned may be in possession of information pertaining to the religion
of the Data Subject. In these instances, the “explicit consent” of the customer would
be required under the Act.
Processing Of Sensitive Personal Data Where The Data Subject Provides Explicit
Consent

2.5

The Act does not define what is meant by “explicit consent”.

2.6

However, the Regulations provide that any “consent” obtained needs to be capable
of being “recorded” and “maintained”. As such, it may be presumed that the same
requirements that apply to consent for processing personal data, apply to Sensitive
Personal Data as well.
28

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

Form of Explicit Consent
2.7

Verbal explicit consent would arise in instances where a Data Subject provides a
verbal statement giving consent for the processing of his/her Sensitive Personal
Data. Bearing in mind the stipulations of the Regulations in relation to consent (i.e.
that consent needs to be capable of being “recorded” and “maintained”), it is
recommended that any verbal explicit consent given by the Data Subject should be
recorded, for example via an audio recording or via a confirmatory e-mail, in order to
fulfil the requirements specified within the Regulations.

2.8

Explicit consent can also be obtained via the conduct of a Data Subject. Without
limiting the same, conduct amounting to explicit consent include where the Data
Subject:
(i)
(ii)

proceeds to volunteer his/her sensitive personal data (e.g. the provision of
the information on the Data Subject’s NRIC); or
continues to utilise the services of the Data User,

subject to compliance with 2.0 of Part 3 of this Code.
2.9

All other forms of explicit consent given by the Data Subject would need to be in
writing (as per the definition in Part 2) and indicate the Data Subject’s agreement to
the processing of his/her Sensitive Personal Data by the Data User. Acceptable forms
of written explicit consent include:
DRAFT

(i)
(ii)

any form of writing indicating the Data Subject’s explicit consent as to the
processing of his/her personal data; or
a signature or tick of the Data Subject indicating his/her explicit consent.

3.0

PRE-EXISTING DATA

3.1

This Code shall apply to all data that:
(i)
(ii)

is in the possession or under the control of Data Users as of 15 th November
2013; and
meets the necessary criteria in order to be recognised as “personal data”.

For the avoidance of doubt, this would include personal data collected and or
otherwise processed by the Data User prior to 15th November 2013.
3.2

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, where:
(i)

the personal data relates to inactive, closed or dormant accounts, Data Users
shall utilise their commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the Act and
this Code; and
29

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

(ii)

data is held in electronic archives and/or in electronic/tape backup media,
the said data shall not be subject to the Act for so long as the Data User
restricts access to the data to authorised personnel only and for backup or
archival purposes respectively.

3.3

In instances where the personal data relate to accounts that are active or to data
that has been reinstated from the backups or the electronic archives of the Data
User, Data Users are required to fully comply with the Act and Code.

4.0

DIRECT MARKETING

4.1

The Act permits Data Users to conduct direct marketing of products and services to
Data Subjects, subject to the caveats laid out herein.

4.2

Section 43(5) of the Act defines “direct marketing” as “the communication by
whatever means of any advertising or marketing material which is directed to
particular individuals”.

4.3

The Act does not define what is meant by “communication”, “advertising or
marketing material” or “directed to particular individuals”. However, in most cases:
(i)

“communication” includes the unsolicited communication via personal
interaction, door-to-door sale calls, post, telephone, fax, e-mail, SMS, or via
other internet / social / application based messaging systems;
“advertising or marketing material” refers to the promotional material of the
Data User or of parties other than the Data User; and
“directed to particular individuals” means that the individual needs to be
identified or be selected based on the use of his/her personal data.
DRAFT

(ii)
(iii)

4.4

Based on the above, the communication by Data Users of advertising or marketing
material to particular individuals selected based on the use of their personal data,
qualifies as direct marketing for the purposes of the Act as the communication is
“directed” at those particular individuals.

4.5

However, Data Users are permitted to send non-targeted marketing materials to all
their customers or to entire categories/types of customers (e.g. all broadband
customers of a Data User).

4.6

It is critical to note that not all marketing falls under the scope of the Act. Where
advertising or marketing material is communicated without knowledge of who the
actual recipients are, for example where mails are sent to “the occupant” of
residences within a neighbourhood and the sender has no knowledge as to the
identity of the respective individuals, the Act will clearly not be applicable. Similarly,
communications that are sent by the sender without knowledge of who the actual
recipient is or non-targeted advertising conducted via the Data User’s website,
clearly do not fall within the ambit of the Act.
30

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

Notice And Consent
4.7

Data Users communicating advertising or marketing material directed to particular
individuals, through the utilisation of the said Data Subject’s personal data (e.g.
name, address, mobile phone numbers, e-mail address) which was provided by:(i)
(ii)

the Data Subject in the course of signing up for products or services of the
Data User; or
Data Subjects who are not customers of the Data User but who have
expressed an interest in the products or services of the Data User (for
example, where the Data Subject calls up the customer service department of
a Data User making enquiries in respect of its products and services),

should either have already notified the Data Subjects of the same via their respective
Privacy Notices (as detailed in 4.8 below), or in cases where their Privacy Notices are
silent as to the issuance of such advertising or marketing material, should obtain the
consent of the Data Subject prior to commencing direct marketing.
4.8

Specifically, Data Users conducting direct marketing are required to notify their Data
Subjects:(i)
(ii)

that their personal data will be used for the purposes of direct marketing;
of the class of third parties the personal data is disclosed or may be disclosed
to (e.g. the Data User’s strategic business associates, preferred merchants);
and
of the right of Data Subjects to refuse such use (for direct marketing / cross
selling purposes) of their personal data at any time by way of providing a
notice in writing to the Data User.
DRAFT

(iii)

4.9

Data Users may provide such notifications to Data Subjects via their Privacy Notice
which are to be disseminated to Data Subjects in compliance with the requirements
of the Notice and Choice Principle. Please refer to 2.0 of Part 3 for further details on
the content of the Privacy Notice.
Obtaining Personal Data from Other Sources

4.10

Data Users are permitted to obtain personal data of individuals (that are not their
customers or that they do not have a pre-existing relationship with), from third party
sources or by referral from Data Subjects themselves, for the purpose of direct
marketing.

4.11

However, Data Users are required to take practical steps to ensure that the
necessary notices and/or the relevant consents of the said individual for the
disclosure of their personal data to the Data User for the purposes of direct
marketing have been obtained.

31

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

4.12

Data Users may do so by entering into written agreements with such third parties,
wherein adequate representations and warranties are provided by the third parties,
i.e. that the relevant consent to disclose personal data has been obtained from the
Data Subject prior to its disclosure to the Data User.

4.13

Using or processing personal data sourced from publicly available sources of
information (such as the Companies Registry at the Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia,
the National Land Registry, personal Facebook pages or the World Wide Web) for
the purpose of direct marketing to individuals is prohibited, as the Data Subject has:
(i)
(ii)

4.14

provided the said personal data for purposes other than direct marketing;
and
not been notified of or consented to receiving direct marketing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Data Users are not barred from contacting Data
Subjects for the purpose of establishing the Data Subject’s interest in the services
provided by the Data User, subject at all times to the maintenance of a system or
process to maintain the details of those Data Subjects that choose to opt-out of
receiving any future marketing communications from the Data User.
Appointment of Marketing Agents

4.15

Where a Data User engages a data processor to conduct direct marketing on its
behalf, for example a mailing house to mail out its direct marketing materials, Data
Users are to impose certain requirements upon the marketing agent as laid out in
4.16.
DRAFT

4.16

For all new contracts entered into between the Data User and the marketing agent,
the Data User shall on a reasonable efforts basis ensure that any processing of
personal data by the marketing agent takes place subject to a contract between the
Data User and the marketing agent which specifies:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

(iv)

(v)

the conditions under which the personal data may be processed;
the representations, undertakings, warranties and/or indemnities which are
to be provided by the marketing agent;
the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing
to be carried out as may be contained in a Data User’s internal security policy
and/or standards;
steps to ensure compliance with those measures, for instance submitting to
on-site audits, completing personal data compliance questionnaires or
obtaining declarations of compliance; and
the deletion, destruction and/or the return of the personal data that is under
the control of the marketing agent upon completion or termination of the
contract.

32

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

4.17

In recognition of the fact that existing agreements of the Data User with marketing
agents may not cater for the above, this Code requires Data Users to utilise their
reasonable efforts to modify said agreements accordingly.
Data Subject’s Right to Refuse Direct Marketing

4.18

As stated in 4.8(iii), Data Users are to provide all Data Subjects with the right to
refuse the use of their personal data for direct marketing purposes.

4.19

Such requests can be made:(i)
(ii)

(iii)

(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)

via the initial application form when signing up for products/services through
an opt-out tick-box; or
in direct marketing communications with the Data Subject, the Data User
includes a prominent statement, or otherwise draws the Data Subject’s
attention to the fact that the individual may make such a request; or
in relation to e-mail marketing, the Data Subject can opt out of receiving
future direct marketing emails by replying with a single word instruction in
the subject column (for example, ‘unsubscribe’); or
in relation to text message marketing, the Data Subject can opt out of future
direct marketing by utilising the measures prescribed by the Data User; or
in relation to phone call marketing, clearly telling Data Subjects that they can
verbally opt out from any future direct marketing calls; or
via a letter from the Data Subject to the Data User; or
via any other reasonable means of written communication recognised by the
Data User.
DRAFT

and needs to be provided to the Data Subject without charge.
4.20

It is recommended that a systematic approach be adopted by the Data User to
effectively comply with a Data Subject’s request to cease direct marketing.
Right to Prevent Processing Of Personal Data For Purposes Of Direct Marketing

4.21

A Data Subject has the right at any time, by notice in writing to the Data User, to
require the Data User to either cease or not begin processing his/her personal data
for purposes of direct marketing. A Data User is required to comply with the written
notice at the end of such period as is reasonable in the circumstances.

4.22

This is further addressed in Part 5 of this Code.

CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES

5.1

Information regarding Data Subjects obtained from credit reporting agencies is
considered to be personal data falling under the ambit of the Act.
Access To Consumer Credit Data

5.2

Data Users may access the credit data of a Data Subject held by a credit reporting
agency (“CRA”) (e.g. through a credit report provided by a CRA), for example in the
process of:(i)

(ii)
(iii)

considering the grant of an application for the Data Users products/services
by conducting appropriate checks for credit-worthiness and for fraud
checking; or
a review of an existing product/service granted to the Data Subject (e.g.
where there is a request for an increase in credit amount); or
the renewal of an existing product/service granted to the Data Subject,

subject to notification being provided to Data Subjects on the collection of consumer
credit data and the purpose for doing so (e.g. conducting checks for creditworthiness) via their respective Privacy Notices and/or obtaining the consent of Data
Subjects.
Disclosure of Credit Data
5.3

Data Users are permitted to disclose the personal data of Data Subjects to CRAs:(i)
(ii)
(iii)

5.4

DRAFT

upon an application for a product and/or service;
upon the Data Subject defaulting in payment; and/or
upon the termination of the Data Subject’s account.

Data Users may obtain the consent of Data Subjects for the collection and processing
of consumer credit data by inserting appropriate consent clauses within the terms
and conditions governing the Data User’s relevant services / facilities.
Defaulters Database

5.5

Data Users are permitted to maintain a listing of Data Subjects that have absconded
without payment or have defaulted in respect of communication services rendered
with one or more commonly appointed CRAs. The said CRAs will maintain such
databases based on the relevant or updated personal data of Data Subjects as
forwarded to the CRAs by Data Users.

5.6

Each Data User is permitted to conduct credit checks utilising the said databases
prior to registering new customers or in managing the subscriptions/accounts of
Data Subjects.

CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION

6.1

Data Users are required by the Regulations to display:
(i)

(ii)

the original Certificate of Registration issued by the Commissioner pursuant
to the Act at the Data User’s principal place of business (for example, the
Data User’s headquarters); and
copies of the Certificate of Registration that have been certified by the
Commissioner at each of the branches of the Data User (for example, the
Data User’s customer service centres),

(hereinafter collectively referred to as “Certificates”).
6.2

For the purpose of interpretation, a “branch” shall mean one or more branches
operated by the Data User where interaction occurs with Data Subjects. For the
avoidance of doubt, kiosks, exchanges, offices of the Data User where there is no
interaction with Data Users, premises operated by marketing agents or dealers,
and/or the premises of data processors, shall not be deemed to be branches for the
purposes of this Code.

6.3

Data Users may display the Certificates on notice boards within the premises, on
electronic displays, on the screens of self-service terminals and/or on the websites of
Data Users. Where the Certificates are displayed at the relevant premises on
electronic screens or their equivalent, Data Users are hereby exempted from
displaying the actual certificate, but will be required to produce the same for the
purposes of inspection by the Commissioner.
DRAFT

6.4

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no need for Certificates to be displayed at the
premises or kiosks of marketing agents or resellers of the Data User.

6.5

Not displaying one or more Certificates shall not be an offence under the Act or its
Regulations where the Certificates have been applied for but have yet to be issued
by the Commissioner subject at all times to the provision of the proof of filing or the
relevant receipt.

TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA ABROAD

7.1

The Act prohibits the transfer of personal data to a place outside of Malaysia unless
the transfer is to a place with data protection laws substantially similar to the Act or
which ensures an adequate level of protection in relation to the processing of
personal data which is at least equivalent to the level of protection afforded by the
Act, as specified by the Minister in a Government Gazette, based on the
Commissioner’s recommendation to the Minister.

7.2

Notwithstanding the above-mentioned prohibition, the Act expressly permits the
transfer of personal data abroad where:
(i)
(ii)

the Data Subject has consented to the transfer; or
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data
User and the Data Subject (for example the provision of international roaming
services to a customer); or
(iii) the transfer is necessary to perform or conclude a contract between the Data
User and third party which has been entered into at the request, or in the
interest, of the Data Subject; or
(iv) the transfer is for legal proceedings or obtaining legal advice; or
(v) the Data User has reasonable grounds for doing so; or
(vi) the Data User has taken reasonable precautions to ensure the personal data
will not be processed in any manner which contravenes the Act; or
(vii) the transfer is necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject (this
would relate to matters of life and death as defined in the Act); or
(viii) the transfer is necessary as being in public interest as determined by the
Minister.
DRAFT

7.3

Based on the above, Data Users are to use all reasonable efforts to:
(i)

(ii)

7.4

address the issue of the transfer of personal data abroad either within their
respective Privacy Notices or by addressing the same within the contract
between the Data User and Data Subject; and
ensure that binding letters are exchanged or appropriate contractual clauses
are inserted into contracts with overseas recipients of personal data, in order
to safeguard the transferred personal data as required by the Act, as expanded
in 7.4 below.

It is recommended that Data Users take reasonable steps to ensure that any
overseas recipients of personal data (for example overseas mobile operators) are
contractually bound:
(i)
(ii)

not to use the Data Subject’s personal data for any reason other than to
provide the relevant products or services, and
to adequately safeguard the Data Subject’s personal data.

PART 5
RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS

1.0

RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO PERSONAL DATA

1.1

Under the Access Principle, any individual, whether or not the individual is a
customer of the Data User, has the right to lodge a data access request (“DAR”) with
the Data User and to receive a reply from the Data User within the time period set in
the Act.

1.2

Other than the individual himself/herself, the persons who may make a DAR on
behalf of the said individual are:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

the parent, guardian or person who has parental responsibility for an
individual below the age of 18; or
a person appointed by a court to manage the affairs of the individual; or
a person authorised in writing by the individual to act on the individual’s
behalf; or
a person authorised in writing by the individual to make a DAR on behalf of
the individual,

who shall collectively be referred to as “Authorised Requestor”.
DRAFT

1.3

For the purpose of Part 5, the term “Data Subject” shall be deemed to include
individuals whose personal data has never been processed by the Data User.
Ambit of A DAR

1.4

A DAR may be made in respect of personal data provided by the Data Subject to the
Data User during registration and any updates thereto that are currently within the
various electronic and physical systems of the Data User.

1.5

Data Users are required to ensure that the personal data that is sought by the Data
Subject/Authorised Requestor is provided to the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor
in an “intelligible form”. “Intelligible form” has not been defined in the Act, and as
such should be interpreted utilising the normal dictionary meaning, wherein a Data
Subject/Authorised Requestor must be able to understand/comprehend the
information supplied without having to revert to the Data User for an explanation.
For example, where a Data User holds personal data in specific abbreviations, codes
or other undefined terms, the same ought to be explained to the Data Subject in a
manner a layperson is able to understand.

1.6

For the avoidance of doubt, personal data being retained for backup and archival
purposes are not subject to the Access Principle.

37

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

1.7

Making A DAR
The Regulations provide that where a Data Subject/Authorised Requestor does not
require a copy of the personal data, the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor must
inform the Data User in writing of the Data Subject’s/Authorised Requestor’s
intention of making a DAR. This would presuppose that Data Users are required to
provide Data Subjects/Authorised Requestor with a choice at the point of making a
DAR, of either:
(i)
(ii)

confirming whether or not the Data User retains any personal data in respect
of the said Data Subject; or
providing the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor with the personal data that
the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor is seeking as per 1.4 above.

1.8

A DAR needs to be specific as to the personal data that is being sought. In this
context, a request for “all personal data” shall not be considered to be a proper DAR.

1.9

Where a Data Subject has separate accounts with a Data User, separate DARs may
be required by the Data User for each account.
Format Of A DAR

1.10

A DAR does not have to be in a particular format. However, there are prerequisites
that a Data Subject/Authorised Requestor must fulfil when making a DAR:DRAFT

(i)
(ii)
(iii)

(iv)
(v)

the DAR must be in writing in a form acceptable to the Data User;
the necessary payment needs to have been enclosed together with the DAR;
the necessary information and documentation as may be required by the
Data User in order to locate the personal data being requested (e.g. name,
NRIC / passport number, address, account number and personal data being
sought);
the DAR must be specific as to the personal data that is being sought; and
relevant certified documentation is to be submitted in order to establish the
Data Subject’s/Authorised Requestor’s right to make a request.

If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, the Data User may return the DAR to
the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor and request that the omitted information /
payment / copies be resubmitted by the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor.
1.11

Data Users may require the use of a standardised form for a DAR to be made by a
Data Subject/Authorised Requestor. A standardised form will assist Data Users in
determining the type of access request that the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor
is making, the specific personal data being sought and how the response is to be
communicated to the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor, amongst others.
Additionally, it will assist the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor by making clear
what information and documentation is required to be submitted together with the
DAR.
38

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

1.12

In instances where a Data User receives a verbal request for access to personal data,
the Data User is not required to respond to the request. However, the Data User
should guide the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor on the proper manner of
making a valid DAR and provide whatever assistance as may be required by the Data
Subject/Authorised Requestor to make a DAR.

1.13

The maximum fees that a Data User may impose for a DAR pursuant to the First
Schedule of the Personal Data Protection (Fees) Regulations 2013 are:
Description
DAR for an individual’s personal data
without a copy
DAR for an individual’s personal data
with a copy
DAR for an individual’s sensitive
personal data without a copy
DAR for an individual’s sensitive
personal data with a copy

Maximum Fees That Data
Users May Impose (RM)
2

30

Receipt And Processing Of A DAR
1.14

In line with the Regulations, a Data User is to provide written acknowledgement of
having received the DAR, upon:DRAFT

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

confirmation of the identity of the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor;
submission of relevant certified documentation to establish the Authorised
Requestor’s right to make a request on behalf of the Data Subject;
the submission of the relevant processing fee(s); and
the personal data being sought being clearly specified.

1.15

In the event the Data Subject’s NRIC details do not correspond with the Data
Subject’s details on record, or the documentation proving the Authorised
Requestor’s right to act on behalf of a Data Subject being insufficient, or the fees not
being submitted, or the personal data not being clearly specified, Data Users have
the right to require the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor to verify their identity to
the Data Users’ satisfaction.

1.16

Where the Data User is of the view that it is necessary and/or appropriate (e.g.
where there is suspicion of deception / false or misleading information is provided /
insufficient documentation provided), it may contact the said Data Subject at his/her
last known telephone number / facsimile number / e-mail address in order to
confirm that the DAR is legitimate.

39

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

1.17

Where the Data User is unclear as to the specific personal data that is being sought
by the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor, the Data User may request for further
information, e.g. account numbers, dates of communication, or description of the
interaction with the Data User.

1.18

Once the Data User has all the necessary information required in order to process
the DAR, the personal data being sought is to be located and provided to the Data
Subject/Authorised Requestor in question, except for instances in which such DARs
may be rejected as provided for in the Act and further in 1.21 below.

1.19

Data Users are required by the Act to revert in writing to the person making the
request within twenty-one (21) days from the date of receipt (i.e. date of
acknowledged receipt) of the DAR. Where the initial twenty-one (21) days is
insufficient, Data Users are required to inform the said Data Subject/Authorised
Requestor in writing of the delay and the required extension, subject to it not being
in excess of fourteen (14) days.

1.20

In the event that only some of the personal data can be located, Data Users are
obliged by the Act to provide the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor with the
sought after personal data to the extent that they are able to do so, whilst informing
the said Data Subject/Authorised Requestor of the efforts being undertaken to
provide the balance of the personal data.
Refusal To Comply With A DAR

DRAFT

1.21

Where a Data User does not comply with a DAR based on the reasons provided in
section 32 of the Act, the Data User is to provide the Data Subject/Authorised
Requestor with written notification of the refusal to comply and supporting reasons.

1.22

Pursuant to but without derogating from section 32 of the Act, Data Users have the
right not to comply with a DAR where:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)

the Data User has not been supplied with sufficient information as
reasonably required (e.g. the name, identification card number, address, and
such other related information as the Commissioner may determine) in order
to establish the identity of the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor, or
establish the Authorised Requestor’s connection to the Data Subject; or
the Data User has not been supplied with sufficient information as it may
reasonably require to locate the personal data to which the DAR relates; or
the Data User is unable to comply with the DAR without disclosing a third
party’s personal data (unless the other person has consented to the
disclosure of the personal data to the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor).
The Data User is required to in this situation balance the Data Subject’s rights
of access to personal data against the third party’s privacy rights in relation to
their personal data. In doing so, the Data User may consider the following
steps:40

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998



(iv)

(v)
(vi)

(vii)

anonymising the personal data of the third party (i.e. omitting names
or not disclosing the names or other identifying particulars of the
third party); or
 seeking the consent of the third party if practical (e.g. where the third
party is easily locatable).
the Data User is of the view: that the burden or expense of providing access is disproportionate to
the risks to the Data Subject’s privacy in relation to the personal data
requested via the DAR (e.g. the time, staff and cost that the Data User
would need to spend on dealing with the DAR and retrieving the
requested data far outweigh the significance of the data to the Data
Subject); or
 that the repetitive or trivial nature of the requests would
unreasonably burden the operations of the Data User; or
providing access would constitute a violation of a court order; or
providing access would disclose the confidential commercial information of
the Data User, meaning that the provision of the personal data to the Data
Subject could possibly harm the competitive position of the Data User.
“Confidential commercial information” includes formulations as to the
creditworthiness of a customer, or disclosure of the fact that confidential
negotiations are ongoing, which might be of value to a competitor of the
Data User; or
access is regulated by another law other than the Act, e.g. the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act
2001.
DRAFT

1.23

Where an exemption applies to the DAR, a Data User may choose to either refuse
the provision of all or some of the personal data requested, depending on the
circumstances.
Administrative

1.24

It is recommended that Data Users maintain a record of all DARs that they have
received as well as the decisions reached in respect of granting or refusing the
respective DARs, in order to be able to respond to further queries from the Data
Subject/Authorised Requestor or to justify to the Commissioner the reasons for noncompliance with a DAR, in the event of an enquiry or investigation being commenced
by the Commissioner.

1.25

It is recommended that Data Users should maintain a record for each DAR with the
following information:(i)
(ii)
(iii)

a copy of the DAR;
a record of the verification of the identity of the Data Subject/Authorised
Requestor;
copies of all correspondences relevant to the DAR;
41

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

(iv)
(v)

a record of any decision made in relation to the DAR; and
a copy of the personal data that was sent to the Data Subject/Authorised
Requestor in question.

2.0

RIGHT TO CORRECT PERSONAL DATA

2.1

Pursuant to the Access Principle, where personal data of a Data Subject is processed
by a Data User and that Data Subject knows that his/her personal data is inaccurate,
incomplete, misleading or not up-to-date, the said Data Subject/Authorised
Requestor may request that one or more corrections be made to his / her personal
data.
Ambit Of A Data Correction Request

2.2

A data correction request (“DCR”) may be made in respect of personal data provided
by the Data Subject to the Data User during registration and any updates thereto
that are currently within the various electronic and physical systems of the Data
User.
Format Of A DCR

2.3

A DCR does not have to be in a particular format. However, there are prerequisites
that a Data Subject/Authorised Requestor must fulfil when making a DCR:DRAFT

(i)
(ii)

(iii)
(iv)

the DCR must be in writing;
the necessary information and documentation as may be required by the
Data User in order to trace and correct the personal data (e.g. name, NRIC /
passport number, address, account number) as notified by the Data
Subject/Authorised Requestor;
the DCR must be specific as to the personal data that is being corrected; and
relevant certified documentation is to be submitted in order to establish the
Data Subject’s/Authorised Requestor’s right to make a request.

If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, the Data User has the right to return
the DCR to the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor and request for the omitted
information / copies to be resubmitted by the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor.
2.4

In instances where a Data User receives a verbal request for a correction to be made
to personal data, the Data User is not required to respond to the request. However,
the Data User should guide the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor on the proper
manner of making a valid DCR.

2.5

No fees are chargeable for making a DCR.

42

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

Receipt And Processing Of A DCR
2.6

Data Users are required to provide written acknowledgement of having received a
DCR upon:(i)

(ii)

confirmation of the identity of the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor or the
submission of relevant certified documentation to establish the Authorised
Requestor’s right to make a request on behalf of the Data Subject; and
the personal data that requires correction being clearly specified.

2.7

In the event the Data Subject’s NRIC details do not correspond with the Data
Subject’s details on record, or the documentation proving the Authorised
Requestor’s right to act on behalf of a Data Subject being insufficient, or the
personal data that is in need of correction not being clearly specified, Data Users
have the right to require the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor to verify their
identity to the Data Users’ satisfaction.

2.8

Where the Data User is of the view that it is necessary and/or appropriate (e.g.
where there is suspicion of deception / false or misleading information is provided /
insufficient documentation provided), it may contact the said Data Subject at his/her
last known telephone number / facsimile number / e-mail address in order to
confirm that the DCR is legitimate.

Pursuant to section 36 of the Act, a Data User has the right not to comply with a DCR
where:
(i)

(ii)

(iii)
(iv)

the Data User is not supplied with sufficient information as reasonably
required (e.g. the name, identification card number, passport number,
address, and such other related information as the Commissioner may
determine) in order to establish the identity of the Data Subject/Authorised
Requestor, or establish the Authorised Requestor’s connection to the Data
Subject; or
the Data User is not supplied with sufficient information as it may reasonably
require in order to ascertain how the personal data in question is inaccurate,
incomplete, misleading or not up-to-date (e.g. where the Data User deems
the individual as a credit risk based on available data and the individual
concerned disagrees with the same but does not provide any other details to
the Data User); or
the Data User is not satisfied that the personal data in question is in fact
inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or not up-to-date; or
the Data User is not satisfied that the correction requested is accurate,
complete, not misleading or up-to-date date (e.g. where an individual seeks a
change to his / her address but the Data User has grounds to believe the new
address provided by the individual to be an attempt in order to avoid the
service of a summons on the individual).

2.13

Where appropriate, Data Users may request for supporting evidence from Data
Subjects/Authorised Requestors prior to effecting the change requested in their
respective DCRs.

2.14

Where the Data User does not comply with a DCR based on any of the reasons
provided in 2.12 above, the Data User is required to provide the Data
Subject/Authorised Requestor concerned with a written notification of the refusal to
comply with the DCR and the Data User’s supporting reasons.

It is recommended that Data Users maintain a record of all DCRs that they have
received as well as the decisions reached in respect of complying or refusing to
comply with the respective DCRs, in order to be able to respond to further queries
from the Data Subject/Authorised Requestor or to justify to the Commissioner the
reasons for non-compliance with a DCR, in the event of an enquiry or investigation
being commenced by the Commissioner.

44

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

2.16

It is recommended that Data Users should maintain a record for each DCR with the
following information:(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

a copy of the DCR;
a record of the verification of the identity of the Data Subject/Authorised
Requestor;
copies of all correspondences relevant to the DCR;
a record of any decision made in relation to the DCR; and
a copy of the corrected personal data that was sent to the Data

3.0

RIGHT TO PREVENT PROCESSING LIKELY TO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE OR
DISTRESS

3.1

A Data Subject has the right to request a Data User in writing (referenced in the Act
as a “Data Subject Notice”) to cease or not to begin processing personal data in
relation to the Data Subject, where the processing causes or is likely to cause the
Data Subject substantial damage /distress and the said substantial damage/distress
is unwarranted.

3.2

However, the Act recognises certain limitations to this right by specifically providing
that a Data Subject does not have the right to prevent the processing of personal
data where:DRAFT

(i)
(ii)

the Data Subject has consented to the processing;
the processing is necessary:





3.3

for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is a party;
or
for the taking of steps at the request of the Data Subject with a view
to entering a contract; or
for compliance with legal obligations that apply to the Data User,
other than a contractual obligation; or
to protect the Data Subject’s “vital interests”, which is defined by the
Act to mean “matters relating to life, death or security of a data
subject”.

Upon receiving a Data Subject Notice, the Data User is required to provide the Data
Subject concerned with a written notice within twenty one (21) days of such receipt:(i)
(ii)

stating that the Data User has complied with or intends to comply with the
Data Subject Notice; or
if the Data User does not intend to comply with the Data Subject Notice, to
provide reasons for the decision; or

45

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

(iii)

3.4

stating reasons why the Data User finds the Data Subject Notice unjustified or
to any extent unjustified and the extent to which the Data User has complied
or intends to comply (if any).

It is recommended that a Data User takes the following factors into consideration
when making a decision on whether to comply with a Data Subject Notice:(i)

(ii)

Does the Data Subject Notice set out how the processing is causing damage
or distress? The Data Subject will have to provide legitimate reasons. The
damage or distress caused will have to be “substantial”, before the Data User
is obliged to comply.
Is the damage or distress unwarranted? In the event the Data User feels that
any damage or distress caused to the Data Subject is warranted, it is unlikely
that the Data User will have to comply with the objection. However, the Data
User is required to provide the Data Subject with reasons for the refusal.

3.5

Where the Data User does not comply with a Data Subject Notice, whether in whole
or in part, the Data Subject may submit an application to the Commissioner to
require the Data User to comply with the Data Subject Notice.

3.6

Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the application from the Data Subject is
justified, the Commissioner may require the Data User to comply with the Data
Subject Notice.
DRAFT

4.0

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT

4.1

A Data Subject has the right to withdraw his/her consent for the processing of
his/her personal data, at any time, by providing the Data User with a written notice.

4.2

Upon receipt and confirmation of a Data Subject’s notice withdrawing consent to
process his / her personal data, the affected Data User must as soon as reasonably
practicable cease to process the Data Subject’s personal data, except to the extent
where the withdrawal of consent would impinge on the rights and obligations of the
Data User under contract or law. Examples of such rights and obligations include:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

the right to be paid for the services rendered, e.g. the settlement of any fees
stipulated for a minimum term, all bills and overdue payments;
the right to bring and maintain one or more court actions against the Data
Subject;
the right to mount or continue investigations (whether internal or otherwise)
involving any allegations involving the Data Subject;
the obligation to maintain personal data for such periods as required under
applicable legislation; and
the conduct of internal audits, risk management and fulfilment of legal or
regulatory reporting requirements.
46

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

4.3

For the avoidance of doubt, where a Data Subject has withdrawn consent to process
his / her personal data, the Data User has the contractual right to terminate
contractual relationship with the Data Subject to the extent the relationship is
affected by the withdrawal of the Data Subject’s consent.

4.4

Without limiting the same, where the Data User receives a notice withdrawing
consent to process a Data Subject’s personal data, the Data User may:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
4.5

commence or follow through on collection of any fees for a stipulated
minimum term, outstanding bills and/or overdue payments (if any) or any
legal proceedings involving the Data Subject;
give notice of termination of contract by virtue of the withdrawal of consent
to process the Data Subject’s personal data;
remove the Data Subject’s personal data from the Data User’s electronic and
physical systems, as far as reasonably possible;
remove the personal data from any marketing initiatives or lists of the Data
User;
remove the personal data from the control of data processors to the extent
applicable; and
archive the relevant personal data for the applicable statutory period.

Data Users are required to implement the above measures within a reasonable
period of time. Any processing of personal data conducted from the receipt of the
notice withdrawing consent to process a Data Subject’s personal data until the above
measures have been fully implemented shall not result in a breach of the Data
Subject’s rights.
DRAFT

5.0

RIGHT TO PREVENT PROCESSING FOR PURPOSES OF DIRECT MARKETING

5.1

Pursuant to the Act, a Data Subject has the right at any time, by notice in writing to
the Data User, to require the Data User to either cease or not begin processing
his/her personal data for purposes of direct marketing.

5.2

For the purpose of the Act, “direct marketing” has been defined as “communication
by whatever means of any advertising or marketing material which is directed to
particular individuals”.

5.3

The permitted marketing practices applicable to Data Users are addressed in greater
depth in Part 4 of this Code.

5.4

It is recommended that any written request from a Data Subject to cease or not to
begin processing his/her personal data for purposes of direct marketing is to be
communicated throughout the organization in order to ensure that the latest
instruction of the Data Subject prevails within the organization. A Data Subject’s
most recent instruction regarding receipt of direct marketing material shall override
his/her previous instructions.
47

PDP Code Of Practice - For Licensees Under The Communications And Multimedia Act 1998

5.5

A Data User needs to comply with the written request within a reasonably
practicable time frame. Sufficient time must be allocated for the Data User and its
group of companies and/or any related corporations (if any) to update relevant
systems and databases to reflect the Data Subject’s latest instructions.

5.6

Where Data Subjects make a written request to Data Users stating their choice to
receive some direct marketing materials and not others (e.g. direct marketing
materials for new communication services and not handset offers), Data Users are
permitted to not provide Data Subjects with all direct marketing materials (barring
marketing communications that are not specifically targeted as addressed in 4.5 of
Part 4), should their systems be incapable of distinguishing between the differing
types of services and products so marketed.

with access to personal data that is specifically required to do their job.

3.4

It is also recommended that Data Users implement access control policies in order to
indicate the various levels of employees that are permitted access, modification
and/or deletion rights in relation to different categories of personal data. Refer to
