and in particular a type of processing using new technology, is likely to result in a
high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the controller that is proposing to
carry out the processing shall conduct an assessment of the likely impact of the
proposed processing operations on the protection of personal data (in this Part
referred to as a “data protection impact assessment”) prior to carrying out the
