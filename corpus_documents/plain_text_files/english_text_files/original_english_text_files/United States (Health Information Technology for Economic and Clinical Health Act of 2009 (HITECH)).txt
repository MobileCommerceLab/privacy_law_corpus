(B) may further restrict the exception described in
paragraph (2)(A) to require that the price charged for the
purposes described in such paragraph reflects the costs
of the preparation and transmittal of the data for such
purpose, if the Secretary finds that such further restriction
will not impede such research or public health activities.
(4) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Paragraph (1) shall apply to
exchanges occurring on or after the date that is 6 months
after the date of the promulgation of final regulations implementing this subsection.
