Health Information Privacy Code 2020

Rule 1

Health information must not be collected by a health agency unless—
(a)

the information is collected for a lawful purpose connected with a function or
activity of the health agency; and

(b)

the collection of the information is necessary for that purpose.

If the lawful purpose for which health information about an individual is collected
does not require the collection of an individual’s identifying information, the health
agency may not require the individual’s identifying information.
Rule 2
Source of health information

(1)

If a health agency collects health information, the information must be collected from
the individual concerned.

(2)

It is not necessary for a health agency to comply with subrule (1) if the agency
believes, on reasonable grounds,—
(a)

that the individual concerned authorises collection of the information from
someone else having been made aware of the matters set out in rule 3(1); or

(b)

that the individual is unable to give their authority and the health agency having
made the individual’s representative aware of the matters set out in rule 3(1)
collects the information from the representative or the representative authorises
collection from someone else; or

(c)

that compliance would—
(i)

prejudice the interests of the individual concerned; or

(ii) prejudice the purposes of collection; or
(iii) prejudice the health or safety of any individual; or
(d)

that compliance is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances of the
particular case; or

or

(ii) will be used for statistical purposes and will not be published in a form
that could reasonably be expected to identify the individual concerned; or

that could reasonably be expected to identify the individual concerned; or
(h)

6

that non-compliance is necessary—

agency, including prejudice to the prevention, detection, investigation,
prosecution, and punishment of offences; or

(ii) for the protection of public revenue; or

the fact that the information is being collected; and

the purpose for which the information is being collected; and

(3)

A health agency is not required to take the steps referred to in subrule (1) in relation
to the collection of information from an individual, or the individual’s representative,
if that agency has taken those steps on a recent previous occasion in relation to the
collection, from that individual or that representative, of the same information or
information of the same kind, for the same or a related purpose.

(4)

It is not necessary for a health agency to comply with subrule (1) if the agency

that, if it is necessary for the information to be given to a person in connection

agency does not make the correction sought.

(2)

A may not assign to an individual a unique identifier that, to A’s knowledge, is the
same unique identifier as has been assigned to that individual by another agency (B),
unless—

(3)

(4)

(a)

A and B are associated persons within the meaning of subpart YB of the Income
Tax Act 2007; or

(b)

the unique identifier is to be used by A for statistical or research purposes and
no other purpose; or

(c)

it is permitted by subrule (3) or (4).

The following agencies may assign the same National Health Index number to an
individual—
(a)

any agency authorised expressly by an enactment; or

(b)

any agency or class of agencies listed in Schedule 2.

Notwithstanding subrule (2) any health agency may assign to a health practitioner as a
unique identifier—
(a)

the registration number assigned to that individual by the relevant health
professional body; or

(b)

the Common Provider Number assigned to that individual by the Ministry of
Health.

(5)

To avoid doubt, A does not assign a unique identifier to an individual under subrule
(1) by simply recording a unique identifier assigned to the individual by B for the sole
purpose of communicating with B about the individual.

(6)

A must take any steps that are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that—
(a)

a unique identifier is assigned only to individuals whose identity is clearly
established; and

15

Health Information Privacy Code 2020

(b)

the risk of misuse of a unique identifier by any person is minimised (for
example, by showing truncated account numbers on receipts or in
correspondence).

(7)

A health agency may not require an individual to disclose any unique identifier
assigned to that individual unless the disclosure is for one of the purposes in
connection with which that unique identifier was assigned or for a purpose that is
directly related to one of those purposes.

(8)

Subrules 13(1) to (6)(a) do not apply to unique identifiers assigned before 30 July
1994.

(9)

However, subrule 13(2) applies to the assignment of a unique identifier on or after 30
July 1994 even if the unique identifier is the same as that assigned by another agency
before that date.

section 66(1)(b) and 66(2)(b) of the Act except in accordance with this clause.

Where an individual makes an information privacy request to a health agency that is
not a private sector agency, the agency may, unless prohibited by law other than the
Act or this code, make a reasonable charge—

where, on a particular day, that agency has made health information available to
that individual in response to a request, for making the same or substantially the
same health information available in accordance with any subsequent request
within a period of 12 months after that day; or

(b)

for providing a copy of an x-ray, a video recording, an MRI scan photograph, a
PET scan photograph or a CAT scan photograph.

estimate of the charge before dealing with the request.
