The Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017
(“the Law”)

Conditions for Lawful Processing
Section 7 of the Law sets out the requirements for processing to be lawful. It refers to
Schedule 2 of the Law and the conditions for processing within that Schedule.
Do not start processing any personal data unless you have clearly established and
documented details of the relevant condition/s.
The majority of conditions require that ‘the processing is necessary’ in order to be able to rely
upon them. If you could reasonably achieve the same purpose without the processing you
cannot rely upon that condition.

For personal data not considered to be special category data, a controller must satisfy at least
one of the conditions below:
•

The data subject has requested or given consent to the processing of the personal data
for the purpose for which it is processed

•

The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
subject is a party or that is in the interests of the data subject

•

The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or other
individual

•

The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests (not applicable for
public authorities)

•

The processing is necessary for the exercise or performance of a public function or
task carried out in the public interest by a public authority
