Mr. KASTENMEIER. Today I am pleased that the Subcommittee on
Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice joins with
the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Technology and
the Law to hold a hearing on H.R. 4947 and S. 2361, bills to protect
the privacy of users of video and library services.
Without objection, by unanimous consent, this meeting may be
covered in whole or part by television and/or radio broadcast and/
or still photography pursuant to Rule 5 of the Committee rules.
Before making any opening statement, I would like to turn to the
distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology and
the Law, Senator Pat Leahy, for his opening remarks.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that and the courtesy of
you letting me go first.
As I mentioned, we have a vote that is going to occur very quickly in the Senate and I will cut out for a few minutes and do that
and come back.
I am pleased to be here for this joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Technology and the Law and
the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, Civil
Liberties, and the Administration of Justice.
I want to compliment you, sir, for the leadership you have
shown, not only in this subject but in so many that I have had the
honor of working with you on over the past several years on every
area from privacy to high technology issues.
It has been a pleasure and it is an honor for me to be able to
come over here and join you in what's a much nicer hearing room
than we have over on the other side. There's better lighting.
Today, we are considering the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act. That is legislation that on the Senate side, I introduced
with Senators Simon, Simpson and Grassley. And you, Mr. Chairman, and Congressman McCandless introduced companion legislation here.
Judge Bork's confirmation hearings last year really provided the
forum for a national civics lesson. From Vermont to California,
Americans exchanged their views on our system of government. No
lesson from those hearings affected us more personally or deeply
than the debate on the right to privacy.
Vermonters certainly let me know where they stood when reporters obtained a list of the movies that Judge Bork and his
family rented and they published them in a Washington newspaper. It was disturbing to see that personal information can be fair
game for reporters or lawyers or nosy neighbors.
Most of us rent movies at video stores and we check out books
from our community libraries. These activities generate an enormous report of personal activity that, if it is going to be disclosed,
makes it very, very difficult for a person to protect his or her privacy.
It really isn't anybody's business what books or what videos
somebody gets. It doesn't make any difference if somebody is up for
confirmation as a Supreme Court Justice or they are running the
local grocery store. It is not your business. It is not my business. It
is not anybody else's business, whether they want to watch Disney
or they want to watch something of an entirely different nature. It
really is not our business.

19
And if we are going to tell people, especially people who want to
be in any form of public life, well, if you do, we are going to go all
the way back and find out what you checked out at your public library, what you took out on videos or what you watch at night on
television programs, then we are in a sorry state.
What a people's philosophy is, whether they are honest, whether
they have integrity, those are valid questions for public office.
Whether you want to watch a particular T.V. program or not isn't
anybody else's business and this law is going to make sure that it
stays nobody's else's business.
In 1986, I worked with the Chairman, with Congressman Kastenmeier, in landmark privacy legislation. That was the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act. That protects communications from
unlawful interception. We seem to be following along that line
here. The Video and Library Privacy Protection Act would protect
personally identifiable information from unlawful disclosure.
It prohibits the disclosure of library borrowing records and it will
provide damages awards when information is unlawfully disclosed.
I am encouraged by the bipartisan support for this, and, Mr. Chairman, again I can't compliment you enough for holding this hearing.
I am encouraged by the broad bipartisan support for the bill and
will work hard for its enactment before the end of the Congress.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. We thank the distinguished Senator for his
opening remarks and it is indeed an honor to chair this committee
with him. Needless to say, I am an admirer of Pat Leahy and have
worked with him on many things, as he pointed out, such as the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act and many other pieces of
legislation which have come to fruition.
I have long been concerned about the increasing number and
types of intrusions into the privacy of American citizens•by both
private individuals and the Government. Over the years, this subcommittee has held both legislative and oversight hearings on this
issue, and as a result, we have helped lead the fight to curb these
troublesome invasions of privacy.
The Senate bill and House bill are another critical step along the
road to meeting a particular problem. These bills follow in the footsteps of other privacy legislation we have considered and the important 1977 report of the Privacy Commission. These bills are an
effort to keep up to date with changing technology and changing
social patterns with respect to the use of materials which ought to
be clearly private.
In any event, I am hopeful that we will be able to move these
bills forward. I think our goal should be in enactment this year if
at all possible. I would think there would be widespread support for
this form of initiative, and I am looking forward to these hearings.

24

Mr. KASTENMEIER. I would like to now yield to the gentleman
from California, Mr. Moorhead.
Mr. MOORHEAD. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The legislation before us today, is H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4947 stems
from the incident last summer when a newspaper reporter found
out from a video store what video films Judge Bork rented and
published a story about his preferences.
The immediate reaction to the Bork episode was a strong bipartisan response. Both the Democrats and Republicans deciding upon
Judge Bork's judgeship became outraged and called for legislation.
This bill is the result with Senators Leahy and Simon joined by
Senator Grassley, sponsoring on the Senate side, Chairman Kastenmeier and our colleague, Mr. McCandless, sponsoring on the House
side.
Mr. Leahy and Chairman Kastenmeier are to be commended for
their long-standing commitment to privacy interests. By the same
token I would like to commend our colleague, Mr. McCandless for
his initiative on this legislation.
The legislation before us today covers libraries and direct marketeers as well as retail stores. The legislation does two basic things:
It restricts what a library can say to anyone, including law enforcement personnel, about a library patron. This covers all library material and not just video. The Government has to fulfill a detailed
subpoena requirement before it can get access to library records.
On this part of the bill, I think it is important that we obtain the
views of the law enforcement community.
The bill restricts video sellers through retail stores and through
the mail. This approach goes far beyond fixing the Bork problem
and attempts to regulate the mail industry.
The video store owners tend to support this legislation. The
direct marketeers oppose its coverage of direct marketing. Their
position is that they have complied with the privacy requirements
for many years and there is no record to support legislative action
against them. Having said that, I look forward to the testimony of
all the witnesses today and I think it will be a very interesting
hearing.

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CARLOS J. MOORHEAD
ON H.R. 4947
•VIDEO ANO LIBRARY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 1988"
AUGUST 3, 1988

The legislation before us today, S.2361 and H.R.4947, steins
from the Incident last summer when a newspaper reporter found out
from a video store what video films Judge Bork had rented and
published a story about his preferences.

The Immediate reaction to the Bork episode was a strong

This bill Is the result with Senators Leahy and

Simon Joined by Senator Grassley sponsoring on the Senate side

sponsoring on the House side.

Senator Leahy and Chairman

Kastenmeler are to be commended for their longstanding commitment
to privacy Interests.

By the same token, I would like to commend

our colleague Mr. McCandless for his Initiative on this Issue.

This legislation before us today covers libraries and direct

This legislation does two

law enforcement personnel about a library patron.
all library material and not just video.

This covers

The government has to

fulfill a detailed subpoena requirement before It can get access
to library records.

On this part of the bill I think 1t Is

Important that we obtain the views of the law enforcement
community.

2.

The bill restricts video sellers both through retail

stores and through the mall.

This approach goes far beyond

fixing the Bork problem and attempts to regulate the mall
Industry.
The video store owners tend to support this legislation.
The direct marketers oppose Its coverage of direct marketing.
Their position is that they have complied with privacy
requirements for many years and there 1s no record to support
legislative action against them.

While 1 agree that the

legislation Is well intended, I think it 1s important that we
proceed carefully to Insure that we do not end up legislating in
an area where In fact there are no problems.

27

Mr. KASTENMEIER. I thank the gentleman from California. I am
very pleased to call as our first witness today our colleague, Al
McCandless. It was Congressman McCandless who introduced the
first legislation in either body to protect the privacy of video store
users.
I am pleased we were able to join together to cosponsor H.R.
4947. Congressman McCandless, you are a strong supporter of the
privacy rights this bill provides, and we are looking forward to
hearing your remarks.
TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE ALFRED A. (AL) McCANDLESS,
A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to
appear before you today. In particular, I want to thank you, Chairman Kastenmeier, for your commitment to individual privacy. Including library services in the legislation was your initiative on the
House side, and I believe this makes for a better bill.
At the heart of this legislation is the notion that all citizens have
a right to privacy•the right to be left alone•from their Government and from their neighbor.
A glance at the list of Members of Congress sponsoring this legislation indicates that this notion transcends party lines and political
philosophy.
There's a gut feeling that people ought to be able to read books
and watch films without the whole world knowing. Books and films
are the intellectual vitamins that fuel the growth of individual
thought. The whole process of intellectual growth is one of privacy•of quiet, and reflection. This intimate process should be protected from the disruptive intrusion of a roving public eye.
What we're trying to protect with this legislation are usage
records of content-based materials•books, records, videos, and the
like.
Under our Constitution, content-based materials receive special
protection. Only in the most extreme circumstances can the Government prohibit their distribution. Yet to the extent that receivers of the information are threatened with a loss of anonymity, the
Constitutional right to distribute materials is licensed. The legislation you are considering, therefore, compliments the First Amendment.
Finally, there is an element of common decency in this legislation. It is really nobody else's business what people read, watch, or
listen to.
We all felt a sense of outrage when Judge Bork's video list was
revealed in print. His privacy was invaded. But what the incident
also demonstrated was the tremendous storage and retrieval capabilities of even the smallest of today's businesses.
Currently, only a chain-link fence protects the privacy of consumers of content-based materials. That chain-link fence is the
policy and discretion of an individual merchant or librarian. I ask
the committees to build a brick wall•a Federal privacy right•
around the individual: Pass H.R. 4947 and S. 2361.

28

Thank you for this opportunity to share my thoughts on the subject, and I would be happy to answer any questions you might
have.

29
CHAIRMAN KASTENMEIER, CHAIRMAN LEAHY, COMMITTEE MEMBERS:

I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY.

IN

PARTICULAR, I WANT TO THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN KASTENMEIER, FOR YOUR
COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY.

INCLUDING LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE

LEGISLATION WAS YOUR INITIATIVE ON THE HOUSE SIDE, AND I BELIEVE THIS
MAKES FOR A BETTER BILL.

AT THE HEART OF THIS LEGISLATION IS THE NOTION THAT ALL CITIZENS HAVE
A RIGHT TO PRIVACY--THE RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE--FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT
AND FROM THEIR NEIGHBOR.

•
A GLANCE AT THE LIST OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SPONSORING THIS
LEGISLATION INDICATES THAT THIS NOTION TRANSCENOS PARTY LINES AND
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.

THERE'S A GUT FEELING THAT PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO READ BOOKS AND
WATCH FILMS WITHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWING.

BOOKS AND FILMS ARE THE

INTELLECTUAL VITAMINS THAT FUEL THE GROWTH OF INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT,
THE WHOLE PROCESS OF INTELLECTUAL GROWTH IS ONE OF PRIVACY--OF QUIET,
AND REFLECTION.

THIS INTIMATE PROCESS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THE

DISRUPTIVE INTRUSION OF A ROVING PUBLIC EYE.

WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT WITH THIS LEGISLATION ARE USAGE RECORDS

30
OF CONTENT-BASED MATERIALS•BOOKS, RECORDS, VIDEOS, AND THE LIKE.

UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION, CONTENT-BASED MATERIALS RECEIVE SPECIAL
PROTECTION.

ONLY IN THE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES CAN THE

GOVERNMENT PROHIBIT THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

YET TO THE EXTENT THAT

RECEIVERS OF THE INFORMATION ARE THREATENED WITH A LOSS OF ANONYMITY,
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE MATERIALS IS LESSENED.

THE

LEGISLATION YOU ARE CONSIDERING, THEREFORE, COMPLIMENTS THE FIRST
AMENDMENT.

FINALLY, THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF COMMON DECENCY IN THIS LEGISLATION.
IT'S REALLY NOBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS WHAT PEOPLE READ, WATCH, OR LISTEN

WE ALL FELT A SENSE OF OUTRAGE WHEN JUDGE BORK'S VIDEO LIST WAS
I
REVEALED IN PRINT.

HIS PRIVACY WAS INVADED.

BUT WHAT THE INCIDENT

ALSO DEMONSTRATED WAS THE TREMENDOUS STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
CAPABILITIES OF EVEN THE SMALLEST OF TODAY'S BUSINESSES.

CURRENTLY, ONLY A CHAIN-LINK FENCE PROTECTS THE PRIVACY OF CONSUMERS
OF CONTENT-BASED MATERIALS.

THAT CHAIN-LINK FENCE IS THE POLICY AND

DISCRETION OF AN INDIVIDUAL MERCHANT OR LIBRARIAN.

I ASK THE

COMMITTEES TO BUILD A BRICK WALL--A FEDERAL PRIVACY RIGHT•AROUND THE
INDIVIDUAL:

PASS

H.R. 4947 AND S. 2361.

THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT,
AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

31
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Congressman McCandless.
I would like to yield to the Senator from Vermont.
Mr. LEAHY. Thank you.
Al, you mentioned the bipartisan support for this, and I agree
with you. Democrats and Republicans may differ on a lot of issues,
but we tend to agree when it comes to protecting privacy.
You mentioned what happened to Judge Bork. We all agree that
that went beyond the pale.
I well remember when Senator Al Simpson came before the committee during the Bork hearings and announced what happened.
That committee, as you know, was split between those supporting
Judge Bork and those opposed to him. But it was unanimous•the
feeling across the committee of outrage•when we learned of the
disclosure.
Everybody said this just went beyond anything that should be
done. I assume you share my view that that was kind of a low
point in the protection of privacy for public officials.
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Yes, Senator, I certainly do.
Mr. LEAHY. Do you also share my view, though, that this law
goes beyond just a protection for the privacy of public officials, that
it affects us all?
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Beg your pardon?
Mr. LEAHY. DO you feel this bill is not just for public officials?
Mr. MCCANDLESS. NO, sir. It is a cross section of the total population. Obviously, in my comments, I pointed out that privacy is the
right of every individual irrespective of their occupation or status
in life.
Mr. LEAHY. Well, I compliment you for your support and work in
this. You certainly have a well-deserved reputation for your own
strong feelings. I compliment you for it.
Mr. Chairman, I have no other questions.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from California.
Mr. MOORHEAD. I want to congratulate you for your work on this
legislation. This is one question that has come to me from the
direct marketing people. Did you mean this bill to go beyond retail
establishments and cover their direct marketing activities?
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Yes. The bill would involve any distribution, be
that retail, store-front, mail order. I realize there is some objection
in that area of mail order or indirect distribution.
Mr. MOORHEAD. I don't know this to be true because I haven't
talked to them in detail about it, but obviously from the stack of
the solicitations we get, catalogs and so forth, I think the lists of
people that buy from one mail order house are sold to every other
one, and it is a general part of the business.
I just wondered whether the transmittal of those names would
now be against the law if this is passed?
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Yes, it would be. Only the names, if the individual were not to check what we call the negative aspect of the
record, then the name of the individual and the address only could
be made available.
Mr. MOORHEAD. DO you know if there has been any showing of
any violation of privacy by the mail order houses?
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Well, we are

32
Mr. MOORHEAD. In telling what kind of materials people are
buying?
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Mr. Moorhead, I am not privileged to that information relative to existing mail houses. As they merchandise
the various commodities, there is no, in my experience, however, is
that there is no restriction as to the selling of mailing lists or
names on mailing lists according to subject matter, which I think is
the basic root of what it was you were referring to earlier about
receiving a lot of mail.
Because of your name and your position and what you may or
may not have done in the field of merchandising and purchases, becomes an important thing to somebody else and when they consider
you a customer. Therefore your name has a value to it.
Mr. MOORHEAD. It works similar if you give $10 to some organization, it seems like every other one solicits you for their consideration. I think the male order business runs a whole lot the same
way. If you buy
Mr. MCCANDLESS. I would hasten to add that we have to distinguish here between content material and what it is that we are
talking about here in the way of a purchase.
Mr. MOORHEAD. I certainly agree with you totally. This is an outrageous kind of thing to have materials that we are buying and
subscribing to, such as books and videos made public.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Would my colleague yield?
Mr. MOORHEAD. Yes.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The bill, as we fashioned it, really has a negative checkoff; that is to say, it assumes you can disclose the name
and address of all persons, unless that person elects to say no. Now,
that would probably not be very many people. So, therefore, for the
most part names and addresses would be available, would presumably become part of these lists, and What we are talking about is
something beyond that.
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Right.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. That is to say, a person would have to consent
to the•to a release of such information as the precise titles of
movies taken out of a video store. So there is a, I think, a protection, which contemplates generally a wide release of names and addresses through the negative checkoff.
Mr. MCCANDLESS. I might compliment the chairman because at
one point in the history of this bill, we had that available without
the negative checkoff, and it was the chairman who in his infinite
wisdom looked at that through his judicial eye and modified it,
which I think made the bill better.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. I'm sorry.
Mr. MOORHEAD. Thank you.
That is all the questioning I had.
Thank you for coming.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from California, Mr. Berman.
Mr. BERMAN. NO questions.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from Ohio, Mr. DeWine.
Mr. DEWINE. NO questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Gentleman from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. No questions.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Slaughter.

33
Mr. SLAUGHTER. NO questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. YOU get off easy, my colleague. If there are no
further questions, we thank you, not only for your appearance here
today, but for your leadership and we will try to work together to
see if we can't bring this legislation to fruition.
I appreciate your appearance this morning.
Mr. MCCANDLESS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Next the Chair would like to call as a panel
Ms. Judith Krug, Director of the Office of Intellectual Freedom of
the American Library Association; Janlori Goldman, Staff Attorney for Project of Privacy and Technology, American Civil Liberties Union; Vans Stevenson, Director of Public Relations for Erol's;
and Richard Barton, Senior Vice President, Direct Marketing Association.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are most welcome. We have a vote on
the House Floor. Ironically what happened is the Senate also has a
vote at this very moment. So I think with the witnesses' agreement, before we go into the testimony of the four witnesses and
they have differing testimony, but nonetheless touching on different aspects, but nonetheless I think it would be good to hear them
in tandem as a group.
Before we do that, we will recess for 10 minutes, pending answering the vote on the House Floor and perhaps by then, also Senator
Leahy might be able to return from his vote in the Senate.
Accordingly, the committee stands in recess for 10 minutes.
[Recess.]
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The committee will come to order.
As the committee reconvenes after its recess for a vote, actually
a vote of both the House and the Senate, and before we get to our
four witnesses who have been introduced, our panel, I would like to
greet, it is a great honor to greet our former colleague, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Paul Simon, and I would like to
call on Senator Simon, if he would for an opening statement.
Mr. SIMON. I thank you very, very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me
commend you for having this hearing.
I think one of the things that we, in the House and Senate have
constantly been reminding ourselves is that one of the most fundamental things we ought to be doing is protecting basic freedoms,
and protecting basic freedoms means the freedom that people have
to have access to information without fear of what may happen to
them as a result of requiring or requesting information.
I am old enough and if you will forgive me, Mr. Chairman, you
are old enough along with me and these young people like Howard
Berman around here don't remember this, but we lived through
the McCarthy period.
Mr. BERMAN. I can remember that.
Mr. SIMON. You can remember that? You are older than I
thought, Howard, but I remember being stationed at Fort Holobird
in the old Counter Intelligence Corps and we went through these
classes where people said Frederick March contributed to Yugoslavians' children's relief, and therefore he is suspect and all of
this.
I wrote a letter to the St. Lewis Post Dispatch suggesting that an
investigation of this whole thing ought to be taking place, that

34

something was happening that was very, very fundamentally
wrong. And I got a letter back from him in a very friendly tone
saying it is not safe for you to write that kind of a letter. You
know, we forget how easily our basic freedoms can be circumscribed, and what we ought to be doing here is to maintain our
basic freedoms, and I think that is what this hearing is all about,
and I commend you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the hearing.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The committee thanks our former colleague
for his poignant remarks and his memory of history.
We will proceed with the panel as has been introduced consisting
of Ms. Krug, Ms. Goldman, Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Barton. We will
start with Ms. Judith Krug, who is director of the Office of Intellectual Freedom for the American Library Association.

Ms. KRUG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Judith Krug. I am the Director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual
Freedom.
The American Library Association is the oldest and largest national library association in the world. It is 112 years old, having
been established in 1876. ALA speaks not only for our 45,000member librarians, libraries, trustees and other interested citizens
throughout the country, but we also speak to a large extent for librarianship throughout the world.
One of the most important aspects of the American Library Association is its intellectual freedom program. As a part of that program, we do take interest in and are concerned about the right of
our citizens, the right of everyone in this country to read what
they will, without fear of reprisal or without fear of being monitored in their reading.
The question of whether or not library records, those records
which identify the uses that individuals make of library materials
and services, are confidential, is not a new question for the ALA.
In fact, we have had a policy on confidentiality since 1970, and this
policy basically has two parts: first, that library circulation records,
in fact all library records, which identify individuals with specific
library materials and services, are private and confidential in
nature and second, that such records should not be made available
to any party, except pursuant to a court order issued by a judicial
authority upon a showing of good cause.
The basis of this policy can be simply stated and I would like to
quote Senator Leahy and probably paraphrase Mr. Kastenmeier
and Mr. McCandless when they said it is nobody's business what
you read, but your own. That is precisely the basis of the ALA confidentiality policy.

35

This belief of librarians in this country has been codified in our
code of ethics. In fact, one of the Code's six articles is devoted specifically and solely to privacy and confidentiality of a patron's use
of libraries. In addition, 38 States and the District of Columbia
have passed statutes which protect the confidentiality of library
use records. These laws, however, are not uniform in their coverage
of either kinds of libraries or kind of services, and as a result, they
do not mitigate the need for a Federal statute in this regard.
It is important to note, however, that not only the ALA policy,
but also the statutes in all the 38 States and DC, do provide mechanisms for compliance with court orders issued by a competent judicial authority. In other words, librarians are not trying to be obstructionists.
We do seek to protect the first amendment rights of patrons and
to safeguard their privacy, but we are not trying to be a road block.
We are trying to preclude what we call fishing expeditions. To explain what these might entail, I would like to give you some examples of the kinds of "fishing expeditions" that my colleagues have
been faced with in the past few years.
There was an incident in Virginia where a husband requested
circulation records of his wife to prove, in their divorce trial, that
she had been "exploring avenues of divorce before the papers were
served."
There was an incident in Albany, New York, where a newborn
infant was found abandoned in an alley by a local college student.
She took the infant immediately to the proper authorities, but, nevertheless, the police investigating the abandonment went to her
college librarian and asked to see the records of the books she
checked out. They wanted to be certain she had not checked out
books on infant care.
Just this past May in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a parish sheriffs
office ordered the parish library director to turn over a list of
people who checked out books on the occult during the past year.
The sheriffs office wanted this information because, and I quote,
"a lot of times Satanic beliefs are connected with narcotics.' Had
there been any Satanic cults in the parish? No. The sheriff said
there hadn't been. He merely wanted the names, addresses and circulation records of library users, "to weed out the curious from the
serious followers of Satan." How this was to be accomplished
through library records remains a mystery to me and to my colleagues.
In a small Delaware community just a few weeks ago, the request was rather more threatening. The director of a public library
received a call from an IRS agent. The director was informed that
the FBI was going to subpoena borrower records. He refused to tell
the librarian why these records were going to be subpoenaed.
When the librarian explained to him the position of the library
profession on confidentiality, and the fact that Delaware does have
a confidentiality statute, the agent responded, "That is your problem. We will just seize the microfilm."
On the other side of the issue, I have a recent example from the
Brooklyn Public Library, from a patron who telephoned the library
seeking information on the recently concluded Soviet Communist
Party Congress in Moscow. She was told that while the complete

36

proceedings had not yet been published, information on the Congress could be found in the New York Times, available in the library's periodicals division. The woman responded, "But if I come
in and ask to see that material, am I going to be reported?"
I consider this to be a serious chilling effect on the use of libraries in this country. Libraries, of course, are the only publicly available resource for ideas and information covering all the problems
and issues that face us. It is our belief that use of this facility, this
wonderful national resource, should be private and confidential
and should be nobody's business but your own.
I thank you very much.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. We thank you for your statement, Ms. Krug.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Krug follows:]

37

Summary of Testimony Presented on Behalf of the
American Library Association
The role of libraries In this country is to provide unmonitored access to the
broadest possible diversity of ideas and information. All persons In this
country have a First Amendment right to seek and to use all publicly-available
information and all have a right to privacy in doing so. These two rights are
inseparable and form the essence of Intellectual freedom, one of the guiding
principles of the library profession in this country.
The question of whether or not library use records are confidential Is not new.
It is a question with which the ALA and its more than 45.000 member librarians,
library trustees, and libraries have been concerned for many years.
Since 1970 the ALA has had a policy (a) that library circulation records are
confidential In nature: and (b) should not be made available to any party except
pursuant to a court order issued by a Judicial authority upon a showing of good
cause.
The basis of this policy may be simply stated: ALA believes that the reading
interests of library patrons are and should be private and that any attempt to
invade such privacy without a showing of a, direct and legitimate need constitutes
an unconscionable and unconstitutional invasion of the right of privacy of
library patrons and the "right to read" implicitly guaranteed by the First
Amendment.
This belief has been codified in the ALA's Code of Ethics. Article II of which
reads:
Librarians must protect each user's right to privacy with respect to
Information sought or received, and materials consulted, borrowed, or
acquired.
In addition, thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia currently protect
the confidentiality of library use records. These laws, however, are not uniform
in their coverage of either kinds of libraries or services. As a result, they do
not mitigate the need for a federal statute In this regard.
It Is important to note that ALA's Policy, the laws of the various states and the
District of Columbia, and the proposed legislation do provide mechanisms for
compliance with court orders Issued by a competent Judicial authority after a
showing of good cause. We do not seek to obstruct legitimate law enforcement
investigations. We do seek to protect the First Amendment rights of patrons and
to safeguard their privacy. The recurring use of libraries as Investigative
sites of first resort, what we call "fishing expeditions," is an unwarranted
Infringement of patrons' rights to unmonitored access to library materials and
services. We recognize that while competing social values must on occasion be
balanced, freedom of speech-and the right to privacy should be compromised only. \
by a compelling need, such need to be determined by a court of competent
Jurisdiction.
The ALA urges your strong support of this much-needed privacy legislation.
Thank you.

the American Library Association (ALA) by Judith F. Krug,
director of the ALA Office for Intellectual Preedoa and C. James

AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
The American Library Association, founded In 1876, le the
oldest and largeet national library association In the world.
Its concerns span all types of libraries:

state, public, school

and acadealc libraries, as well aa libraries eervlng persons In
government, commerce and industry, the arts, the araed eervlces,
hospitals, prleone, and other institutions.

Nlth a membership of

more than 45,000 libraries, librarians, library trustees, and

2
'other Interested persons from every state and many countries of
the world, the Association Is ths chief spokesaan for the people
of the United States In their search for the highest quality of
library and Information services.

The Association works closely

with more than 70 other library associations In the United
States, Canada, and other countries, •• well as with >any other
organizations concerned with education, research, cultural
development, recreation, and public service.

ALA Is governed by

Its Council, coaprlsed of 172 members.
The Intellectual Freedom Committee was established In 1940
by the Council.

The Committee's statement of responsibility

reads. In part, "To recommend such stsps as may be necessary to
safeguard the rights of library ussrs, libraries, and librarians.
In accordance with the Plret Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
and the LIBRARY BILL OP RIGHTS (copy attached) as adopted by the
ALA Council.
THE ROLE OP LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
Ours Is a constitutional republic - a government of the
people, by the people, and for the people.

But In order for this

form of government to function effectively, Its electorate must
be able to Inform Itself - the electorate must have information
available and accessible.

The role of libraries as impartial

resources providing information on all points of view Is
essential for our type of government and society, and must not
be compromised.

40
3
Libraries are perhaps the greatest resource a free people
can claim.

They most definitely are the only places In our

society where every person can find materials representing all
points of view concerning the problems and Issues confronting
them aa Individuals and as a society.

In addition, libraries

make these materials available and accessible to anyone Mho
desires or requires them, regardlees of age, race, religion,
national origins, social or political views, economic status, or
any other characteristic.
PRINCIPLES OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION
One of the guiding principles of the library profession In
this country is Intellectual freedom.

To librarians, this

concept Involves two Inseparable rights.

The first Is the First

Amendment right to seek and obtain access to all publiclyavailable ldeaa and information.

The second Is the right to have

what one has sought and what ona has used kept private.

The

right to Information cannot help but be inhibited If personal
reading or research Interests can and will become known to others
without one's own consent.
It was. In fact, not all that long ago that, for example,
responsible U.S. scholars working in the areaa of Eaetern
European history, economics, and political sclsnce were publicly
branded as "communists" because It became known that they read
extensively from communist bloc publications, notwithstanding the
fact that such publications constitute the primary source of
Information on such subjects.

41
4
Even today, there are people In every community who believe
that a person's Interest In a subject must reflect not merely
Ms Intellectual Interests, but his character and attitudes.
Thus. In the view of sons people, a person who reads the
"underground press" Is branded as a radical; a person who reads
atheistic tracts Is marked an atheist; a person who reads
sexually oriented literature Is Identified as a libertine; a
person who reads works on apartheid Is characterized as a racist;
a person who reads gay literature Is homosexual; and one who
reads about the occult and satanlsm Is "Into" witchcraft.

Such

characteristics are not justified or warranted by such literary
pursuits but If charged, they can be personally and
professionally damaging.
The American Library Association has had a "Policy on
Confidentiality of Library Records" (copy attached) since 1970.
This formal policy was adoptsd at that time In response to
attempts by U.S. Treasury agents to examine circulation records
In a number of cities.

Since 1970, thirty-eight etates and the

District of Columbia have enacted "Confidentiality of Library
Records" statutes (list attached).
In 1981, the Association adopted a "Statement on
Professional Ethics (copy attached) Including a Code of Ethics.
Article II of this Code reads:
Librarians must protect each ueer's right to privacy with
respect to Information sought or received, and materials
consulted, borrowed, or acquired.

42
s
The basis of both the Policy on Confidentiality of Library
Records and Article II In the Code of Ethics may be simply
stated:

ALA believes that the reading Interests of library

patrons are and should be private and that any attempt to invade
such privacy without a showing of direct and legitimate need
constitutes an unconscionable and unconstitutional invasion of
the right of privacy of library patrons and the "right to read"
Implicitly guaranteed by the First Amendment.
Perhaps some examples of the kinds of requests that
librarians constantly receive will explicate our concern.
e In 1976, In New Mexico, police asked for circulation
Information on certain books to Investigate a "Chicane guerilla
movement" supposedly operating In the town.
• A divorced father in Illinois wanted access, la 1978, to
the public library story hour registration recorde to make sure
that his child was using his name and not that of the mother's
current husband.
e Also In 1978, religious groups In Florida requested ths
names of persons who had read certain books.

The purpoee was to

contact such readers and urge them to join a religious
organization.
e In 1979, New York detectives asked for circulation records
of a list of books on lie detectors because they suspected
"somebody was trying to beat a lie detector test."
• That same year in Virginia, a husband requested
circulation records of his wife to prove in their divorce trial

43
6
that she had been "exploring avenues of divorce" before he filed
the papers.
• In 1980, a hospital staff member In Illinois ordered
sexually explicit films for use In therapy classes.

The flime

were placed In the hospital library and the librarian was then
requested - by another ataff member - to provide hie with the
names of persons who had borrowed the fllae.
e In i960, a local college student In Albany, Raw York,
found a newborn Infant abandoned In an alley.
Infant immediately to proper authorities.

She took the

Nevertheless, police

Investigating the abandonment went to her collage librarian and
aaked to eee the records of the books she had checked out.

They

wanted to aacertaln If she had checked out books on Infant car*.
• In 1961, the Moral Majority In Washington Stats, deaanded
the Washington State Library release the naaea "of public schools
and public school employees" who borrowed a 21-minute movie
entitled ACHIEVING SEXUAL MATURITY.
a In 1988, law enforcement officials In Crawfordsvllls,
Indiana, demanded public library circulation records on the
grounds that these records wsrs needed for research into
"satanlsa."
• In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, In March of this ysar, the
Rapidee Parish Sheriff's Offlcs ordered the parish library
director to turn over a list of people who had checked out booke
on the occult in the laat year.

The sheriff's office wanted this

information because, "a lot of times" aatanlc beliefs are

44
7
"connected with narcotics."
the parish?

Had there been any satanlc cults In

No. the sheriff "merely" wanted the names,

addresses and circulation records of library users "to weed out
the curious from the serious followers of satanIsm."

How this

was to be accomplished through library records remain* a mystery.
s In a small Delaware library, the request was rathar more
threatening.

In May of this ysar, the director of a public

library received a call from an Internal Revenue Service agent.
The director was Informed that the "IRS Is going to subpoena the
library's borrower records."

The agent would not say why.

Whan

the director stated the profession's stance on the
confidentiality of library records, the agent responded, "That's
your problem•we will Just seize your microfilm."
• And just last Thursday, ALA was lnforaad (by a Journalist,
no less) that the police department of Whitestown, New York, had
asked for the records of library patrons who checked out
materials on satanlsa and the occult during the last four years.
In some of the states where thess Incidents occurred, there
were statutes protecting the confidentiality of library use
records.

In others, there were not.

Occasionally, thess and

other Incidents led to the adoption of such statuea.
It is important to note that ALA'S Policy, and the laws of
the various states and the District of Columbia, do provide
mechanisms for compliance with court orders Issued by a competent
Judicial authority after a showing of good cause.

We do not seek

to obstruct legitimate law enforcement Investigations.

We do

45
8
seek to protect the First Amendment rights of patrons and to
safeguard their privacy.

The recurring use of libraries as

Investigative sites of first resort, what We call "fishing
expeditions," is an unwarranted infringement of patrons' rights
to unmonltored access to library materials and services.

He

recognize that while competing social values must on occasion be
balanced, freedom of speech and the right to privacy should be
compromised only by a compelling need, such need to be determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction.
VARIATIONS IN SCOPS AND COVERAGE OF EXISTING STATE LAWS
Many of the etatutes anacted by the thirty-eight statss and
District of Columbia which protect the privacy of library
records did not adequately anticipate the ways technology has
changed the character of library use.

Thus, many of these

statutee apply to only one or two kinds of libraries. I.e.,
public, school, and/or academic.

In addition, many of the

statutes refer only to materials "checked out" of libraries.
Increasingly, however, library patrons use online databaaes.
Moreover, none of these statues protect privacy rights of ths
information in multi-library, not to mention multi-state,
networks, many of which share not only cataloging but alao
circulation information, for example, In the cass of intsrllbrary
loans,

while many people continue to think of libraries ae the

small local facility where one checks out the lateet beat seller,
widespread computerization hae radically changed the face of
libraries across this country.

46
9
Some of the state laws apply only to public libraries, not
to school libraries.

Some apply only to those libraries

receiving state funds.

This legislation would both extend the

uneven coverage of the privacy protection now afforded to library
patrons and would extend the scope of library use that Is
protected.
It Is of critical importance that the right to free and
unmonitored access to the widest possible diversity of publiclyavailable ideas and Information not only be protected but also
expanded.
BALANCING COMPETING INTERESTS
Any legislation considered by Congress of necessity
must accommodate diverse interests.

Among these potentially

affected by H.R. 4947 and S. 2361, two are prominent - the direct
mail organizations and law enforcement agencies.

The first have

little. If any, relationship to libraries and thus we make no
comment about these interests.
Concerns which may be expressed by law enforcement agencies
seem to ALA to be without basis.

H.R. 4947 and S. 2361 would

impose no more of a burden than is now the case for subpoenas and
warrants.

Given the evidence that law enforcement agents have in

the past attempted to secure personally Identifiable information
from libraries without court orders, the protection afforded by
this bill Is necessary.

47
10
In closing, we quote from Senator Sea J. Brvln, Jr., who. In
1970, wrote:

"... Throughout history, official surveillance of

the reading habits of citizens has been a 11tans test of
tyranny."*

Olven the laportance of privacy to the sffactlvsness

of libraries in our democratic society, this legislation is
desirable and the American Library Association urges that It
become the law of the land (ses attached resolution).

•Letter to Secretary of the Treasury David M. Kennedy, dated July
9. 1970.

Hibrarg Sill nf StgljtH

The American Library Association affirms that all libraries are forums for
information and ideas, and that the following basic policies should guide
their services.
1. Books and other library resources should be provided for the interest
information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library
serves. Materials should not be excluded because of the origin, background,
or views of those contributing to their creation.
2. Libraries should provide materials and information presenting all
points of view on current and historical issues. Materials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.
3. Libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment
4. Libraries should cooperate with all persons end groups concerned
with resisting abridgment of free expression and free access to Ideas.
5. A person's right to use a library should not be denied or abridged
because of origin, age, background, or views.
6. Libraries which make exhibit spaces and meeting rooms available to
the public they serve should make such facilities available on an equitable
basis, regardless of the beliefs or affiliations of individuals or groups requesting their use.

Adopted July 13. 19SB. by the ALA Council

54

Mr. KASTENMEIER. Next we would like to call on Janlori Goldman, Staff Attorney, Project on Privacy and Technology, American
Civil Liberties Union.
Ms. GOLDMAN. Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to testify on the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act legislation by both the House and Senate that would
create a Federal right to privacy and video type rental or sale
records and library circulation records.
The movies we view in the privacy of our home and the books we
borrow from the library may reveal sensitive, personal information
about us and should not be disclosed absent a compelling State interest in the information. Passage of the Video and Library Privacy
Protection Act will be an important step towards allowing individuals to maintain some control over this information.
The ACLU strongly supports the legislation and we commend
Congress for acting quickly to create a substantive privacy barrier
around First Amendment protected information. In this age of information and computers, in which we are forced to turn over an
enormous quantity and variety of personal information in exchange for doing business with others, we have relied on Congress
to enact information privacy legislation.
We welcome the resurgence of privacy coalitions and the
groundswell of public support for privacy that was reignited during
last year's confirmation hearings. We hope that the momentum
will not be lost and that we can continue to move forward to give
citizens control over their personal information.
The Video and Library Privacy Protection Acts of 1988 prohibit
video service providers and libraries from disclosing personally
identifiable information except in limited circumstances, such as
with the individual's consent or pursuant to a court order.
The legislation gives people control over their personal information divulged and generated in exchange for receiving services
from video providers and libraries. These bills reflect the founding
principle of the Privacy Act of 1974 information collected for one
purpose may not be used for a different purpose without the individual's consent.
The need for the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act has
been clearly established, not only be the unauthorized disclosure of
the Bork family's video rental list, but by a history of unauthorized
video and library record disclosures.
Thirty-eight States and the District of Columbia have statutes
protecting the confidentiality of library records. In addition, major
library organizations have adopted very strong policies on the confidentiality of library patron records.
Nothing makes more clear the need for this legislation than the
unauthorized disclosure of the Bork family's video rental list. The
City Paper reporter attempted to use the video list to create a profile of Judge Bork's private character. The unauthorized release of
Judge Bork's video list, which was then used to investigate his
character, cannot be condoned, just as we would not condone the
breaking into his home to discover what books he reads.
The ACLU vigorously supports these bills. We believe, as does
the majority of the American public, that privacy is an enduring

55

and cherished value and that legislation is necessary to protect personal, sensitive information.
The public's concern for their privacy rights dramatically increased during Judge Bork's confirmation hearings. In fact, the
majority of Senators who voted against his confirmation cited their
concern about the Judge's limited view of the constitutional right
to privacy. A broad-based, bipartisan coalition pulled together
shortly after the disclosure of the Bork family's video list to support remedial legislation to ensure such a thing could never
happen again.
Privacy is more than just the right to be let alone. Our right to
privacy is intimately tied to our sense of individual autonomy•
that when we are not committing a crime, we should be able to live
our lives outside of the public eye. This particularly true when our
activities implicate both First Amendment and privacy values.
These are precisely the type of activities addressed by this legislation.
The Supreme Court, in NAACP v. Alabama, recognized the
severe chilling effect on First Amendment freedoms that can result
from the unauthorized disclosure of one's personal, political beliefs.
These precious rights have grown increasingly vulnerable with
the growth of advanced information technology. The new technologies not only foster more intrusive data collection, but make possible increased demands for personal, sensitive information. This
massive and sophisticated data collection increases the threat of
private and Government surveillance.
New technologies enable people to receive and exchange ideas
differently than they did at the time the Bill of Rights was drafted.
Personal papers once stored in our homes are now held by others
with whom we do business. Transactional information may be
easily stored and accessed. Records of our reading and viewing histories are now maintained by libraries, and cable television and
video companies. The computer makes possible the instant assembly of this information.
The ACLU is concerned about the danger posed by the aggregation of separately compiled lists to create profiles on individuals•
the phenomenon of the womb-to-tomb dossier.
In its 1977 report, "Personal Privacy in an Information Society,"
the Privacy Protection Study Commission concluded that an effective national information policy must embody three major principles: minimize intrusiveness, maximize fairness and create legitimate, enforceable expectations of confidentiality. As a general rule,
the Commission recommended, organizations that maintain a confidential record must be placed under a legal duty not to disclose the
record without the consent of the individual, except in certain limited circumstances, such as pursuant to a search warrant or subpoena.
Even in such instances, the individual must have the right to
challenge the court order before disclosure of the record. The Commission s finding most pertinent here is that there should be a
close correspondence between an individual's expectation of the
uses to be made of his or her information and the uses that are
actually made of it.

56
The Commission noted the strong push for greater selectivity in
the use of records about individuals to develop mailing lists. "That
drive, coupled with new technological capabilities could change the
character of the way direct-mail operations are conducted, a
change called "troubling" by Publishers Clearing House and Computer World, who testified before the Commission.
The technological environment anticipated, by the Commission
has arrived and we must meet the threats to privacy posed by the
uses of these systems. Last Sunday's New York Times reports that
American Express is using new technology to develop a system to
track card-holders' charge slips.
"The company's computer might identify a frequent traveler to
Tokyo, or an avid tennis player. Working with American Express,
a Tokyo hotel or a local sporting goods shop could then custom
tailor advertising to the card-holder."
That is precisely the situation we are trying to prevent here with
the exchange of First Amendment-related information, such as the
movies we watch. This legislation is intended to be a protection for
consumers, not a punishment on the industry. That is why it is
supported by Erol's and VSDA and the library community. The legislation before us today promises to be another positive congressional response to the need for protections on personal, sensitive information.
The ACLU is hopeful that the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act will continue to garner broad, bi-partisan support. We look
forward to continuing to work closely with you to ensure passage of
this important and timely legislation.
Thank you.

SUMMAP-Y OF ACLU TESTIMONY
I appear today on behalf of the ACLU to testify in
support of the Video and Library Privacy Protection Acts, S.2361
and H.R.4947, legislation introduced in both the House and the
Senate that would create a federal right to privacy in video tape
rental or sale records and library circulation records.
The First and Fourth Amendments to the United States
Constitution, when read together, give rise to a powerful
argument in favoring of extending legal protection to video and
library records. The movies we view in the privacy of our home
and the books we borrow from the library may reveal sensitive,
personal information about us and should not be disclosed absent
a compelling state interest in the information. Passage of the
Video and Library Privacy Protection Act will be an important
step towards allowing individuals to maintain some control over
this information.
The ACLU strongly supports the legislation and we commend
Congress for acting quickly to create a substantive privacy
barrier around First-Amendment protected information. In this
age of information and computers, in which we are forced to turn
over an enormous quantity and variety of personal information in
exchange for doing business with others, we have relied on
Congress to enact information privacy legislation.
The legislation before us today promises to be another
positive Congressional response to the need for protections on
personal, sensitive information.
The ACLU is hopeful that the Video and Library Privacy
Protection Act will continue to garner broad, bi-partisan
support. He look forward to continuing to work closely with you

ON BEHALF OF THE

THE VIDEO AND LIBRARY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACTS OF 1988
BEFORE THE
SUBCOMMITTEE ON TECHNOLOGY AND THE LAW

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

AUGUST 3, 1988

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

IWRC-PVCTIQH
I appear today on behalf of the ACLU to testify in
support of the Video and Library Privacy Protection Acts, S.2361
and H.R.4947, legislation introduced in both the House and the
Senate that would create a federal right to privacy in video tape
rental or sale records and library circulation records.

I am a

staff attorney on the ACLU's Project on Privacy and Technology, a
research project that addresses how computers impact on
information and privacy.

The ACLU is a nationwide, nonpartisan

organization with 250,000 members dedicated to preserving
citizens' constitutional rights.
The First and Fourth Amendments to the United States
Constitution, when read together, give rise to a powerful
argument in favoring of extending legal protection to video and
library records.

The movies we view in the privacy of our home

and the books we borrow from the- library may reveal sensitive,
personal information about us and should not be disclosed absent
a compelling state interest in the information.

Passage of the

Video and Library Privacy Protection Act will be an important
step towards allowing, individuals to maintain some control over
this information.
The ACLU strongly supports the legislation and we commend
Congress for acting quickly to create a substantive privacy
barrier around First-Amendment protected information.

In this

age of information and computers, in which we are forced to turn

over an enormous quantity and variety of personal information in
exchange for doing business with others, we have relied on
Congress to enact information privacy legislation.

THE VIDEO AND LIBRARY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACTS OF 1988
The Video and Library Privacy Protection Acts of 1988
prohibit video service providers and libraries from disclosing
personally identifiable information except in limited
circumstances, such as with the individual's consent or pursuant
to a court order.

The legislation gives people control over

their personal information divulged and generated in exchange for
receiving services from video providers and libraries.

These

bills reflect the founding principle of the Privacy Act of 1974information collected for one purpose may not be used for a
different purpose without the individual's consent.

EXCEPTIONS
The exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure are narrowly
tailored, allowing disclosures with the individual's consent, for
a legitimate business purpose or pursuant to a court order.

The

ACLU supports the legislation's requirement that, as a general
rule, personally identifiable information may only be disclosed
with the prior written consent of the individual.
The House bill requires the individual must be informed as
to what information will be disclosed and to whom.

Services may

61
not be denied to individuals who choose not to allow the
disclosures.

This provision grants individuals the most

meaningful control over their information, while allowing the
recordholder to use the information as necessary for legitimate
business purposes.
The ACLU also supports the section in both bills allowing a
disclosure of the name and address of the patron where such
disclosure does not directly or indirectly reveal the title or
content of the service used and the individual has been given an
opportunity to prohibit the disclosure.
The legislation's court order requirement, comparable to
the standard embodied in the Cable Communications Policy Act of
1984, provides that before a court order can be issued, a law
enforcement agency must present clear and convincing evidence
that the record subject has engaged in criminal activity and that
the information sought would be highly probative in a criminal
proceeding.

In addition, the House bill mandates the agency must

show that its attempts to use less intrusive means to gain the
information failed.

The agency must also make the case that the

value of the information sought outweighs the individual's
privacy interests..

Both bills require that upon issuance of a

court order, individuals must receive, notice and the opportunity
to challenge the order.

The ACLU supports this standard.

We

believe it is strong, effective and fair, and will not create an
absolute ban on disclosure where the information is necessary for
law enforcement purposes.

62
REMEDIES
The ACLU strongly supports the legislations' civil remedies
section, providing that an individual harmed by a violation of
the Act say seek compensation in the form of actual and punitive
damages, equitable and declaratory relief and attorney's fees and
costs.

This section puts essential teeth into the legislation,

ensuring that the law will be enforced by individuals who suffer
as the result of unauthorized disclosures.
Statutory damages are necessary to remedy the intangible
harm caused by privacy intrusions.

Similar remedies exist in the

Cable Communications Policy Act and the federal wiretap statutes.
We have seen the promise of the 1974 Privacy Act fade due to the
lack of an effective enforcement mechanism.

We applaud members

in both the Rouse and the Senate for including a civil remedies
section in the Video and Library Privacy Protection Acts.

THE NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The need for the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act
has been clearly established, not only by the unauthorized
disclosure of the Bork family's video rental list, but by a
history of unauthorized video and library record disclosures.

Library Records
Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have

63
statutes protecting the confidentiality of library records.
In addition, major library organizations have adopted very strong
policies on the confidentiality of library patron records.
The American Library Association adopted a policy on
confidentiality of library records in 1970 in response to
attempts by United States Treasury agents to gain access to
circulation records.
There have been recent reports that the FBI has been asking
library personnel in various libraries around the country to
divulge patrons' records.

However, James Geer, Assistant

Director of the FBI's Intelligence Division recently testified:
"I can assure you that the FBI is not now nor has it even been
interested in the reading habits of American citizens. No records
or reading lists of any U.S'. citizen have been sought or obtained
by the FBI in any of our contacts with librarians either within
or outside the New York City area."

(Hearings before the

Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House
Committee on the Judiciary. 100th Cong., 2nd Sess., 8 (July 13,
1988) unofficial transcript.

Hereinafter "FBI hearing").

In his

testimony, Mr. Geer also noted: "I have found no situation at all
where we got any records or any information on any U.S. person as
far as library records or personal information goes, any.

. . .

And if we find that we are about to violate a state statute in
any sense, we will back away from that."

(FBI hearing at 33,

28).
As the Bureau has indicated, and as Representative

64
Kastenmeier pointed out in his statement in the June 29, 1988
Congressional Record, if the FBI is not interested in obtaining
library patrons' records, then the Video and Library Privacy
Protection Act will not interfere with the Bureau's activities.
In this instance, any exception for national security purposes is
unjustified and will weaken the intended strength of this
legislation.

Video Rental Lists
Nothing makes more clear the need for this legislation than
the unauthorized disclosure of the Bork family's video rental
list.

The Citv Paper reporter attempted to use the video list to

create a profile of Judge Bork's private character.

The

unauthorized release of Judge Bork's video list, which was then
used to investigate his character, can not be condoned, just as
we would not condone the breaking into his home to discover what
books ha reads.
Although the disclosure of Judge Bork's list may be the most
sensational and well-known disclosure, other similar incidents
have been documented.

For instance. Jack Messer, vice-president

of the Video Software Dealer's Association and owner of 22 video
rental stores, reported in the Philadelphia Inquirer that the
attorney for the wife in a divorce proceeding made an informal
request for the records of every film rented by her husband in an
effort to show that, based on his viewing habits, he was an unfit
father.

Again, the movies we watch in the privacy of our own hones
nay reveal a great deal about our politics and personalities, the
nost personal, sensitive aspects of ourselves that we may choose
to express outside the scope of the public's gaze.

THE LEGISLATION'S GENESIS: THE CONCERN FOR PRIVACY
The video rental list issue gained national attention during
the confirmation hearings of Judge Robert Bork after a reporter
for Cltv Paper obtained a list of the video tapes rented by Judge
Bork and his family.

At that time, many Senators, including

Senators Alan Simpson, Joseph Biden, and Patrick Leahy, expressed
outrage

at this intrusion into the Bork family's privacy.

Senator Leahy characterized the disclosure of the tapes as "an
issue that goes to the deepest yearning of all Americans that we
are here and we cherish our freedom and we want our freedom. We
want to be left alone."

(Nomination of Robert H. Bork to be

Associate Justice of the Supreme Couret of the United States:
Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. 100th
Cong., 1st Sess., 1374 (September 28, 1987).
"Confirmation Hearings").

Hereinafter

Senator Simpson specifically asked for

the ACLU's reaction to the list disclosure.

By the end of the

day, we responded with a letter to the editor of Cltv Paper and a
commitment to Senator Simpson to work on legislation to safeguard
individuals from similar privacy intrusions.

(See Confirmation

Hearings at 1372-74, 1674-77 (September 29, 1988).
On October 21, 1987, Representative Al McCandless introduced

66
the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1987 to create a "federal
protection from this kind of snooping" by preventing the
unauthorized disclosure of a person's video rental history.
Representative McCandless' early action sparked the work of
others in the House and the Senate.

The need to protect video

rental lists was widely supported, but there was also a strong
belief that the First Amendment and privacy concerns raised by
the unauthorized disclosure of video rental lists necessitated
expanding the bill to cover library borrower records.
On Hay 10, 1988, Senator Leahy introduced the Video and
Library Privacy Protection of 1988, co-sponsored by Senators
Simon, Grassley, and Simpson.

On June 29, 1988, Representative

Kaatenmeier joined Representative McCandless in introducing an
expanded version of the original Bouse legislation.
The ACLU vigorously supports these bills.

He believe, as

does the majority of the American public, that privacy is an
enduring and cherished value and that legislation is necessary to
protect personal, sensitive information.

A number of Harris

surveys have documented the growing public demand for privacy
legislation.

In a 1983 analysis of their survey results, Louis

Harris 4 Associates concluded:
Particularly striking is the pervasiveness of support for
tough new ground rules governing computers and other
information technology. Americans are not willing to endure
abuse or misuse of information, and they overwhelmingly
support action to do something about it. This support
permeates all subgroups in society and represents a mandate
for initiatives in public policy.
(Louis Harris, The Road
after 1984: A Nationwide Survey of the Public and its
Leaders on the New Technology and its Consequences for
American Life. December, 1983).
8

67
The public's concern for their privacy rights dramatically
increased during Judge Boric's confirmation hearings.

In fact,

the majority of Senators who voted against his confirmation cited
their concern about the Judge's limited view of the
Constitutional right to privacy.

A broad-based, bi-partisan

coalition pulled together shortly after the disclosure of the
Boric family's video list to support remedial legislation to
ensure such a thing could never happen again.
The immediate and sustained alarm that many experienced over
the video list disclosure may be explained by our society's
deeply cherished belief that the right to privacy is, as Justice
Brandeis said, "the right to be let alone• the most
comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by.civilized
men."

(Olmstead v. U.S.. 277 U.S. 438 (1928), J. Brandeis

dissenting).

Our right to privacy is intimately tied to our

sense of individual autonomy• that when we are not committing a
crime, we should be able to live our lives outside of the public
eye.

This is particularly true when our activities implicate

both First Amendment and privacy values.
The First Amendment guarantees us our right to publish and
receive ideas.

The Fourth Amendment buttresses the right of

citizens to read and acquire information free from governmental
intrusion, a right essential to the free flow of information and
intrinsic to a free and democratic society.

The Supreme Court,

in NAACP v. Alabama. 357 U.S. 449 (1958), recognized the severe

chilling effect on First Amendment freedoms that can result from
the unauthorized disclosure of one's personal, political
beliefs.

In addition, the Court declared in Stanley v. Georgia.

394 U.S. 557 (1969): "If the First Amendment means anything, it
means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone
in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch."
These precious rights have grown increasingly vulnerable
with the growth of advanced information technology.

The new

technologies not only foster more intrusive data collection, but
make possible increased demands for personal, sensitive
information.

Private commercial interests want personal

information to better advertise their products. The government is
interested in sensitive information to enhance political
surveillance.

And, the intelligence community may be looking at

reading lists to protect our national security.

The danger here

is that a watched society is a conformist society, in which
individuals are chilled in their pursuit of ideas and their
willingness to experiment with ideas outside of the mainstream.
Although Judge Bork recently joked about how embarrassed he is to
have the world learn that he watches dull movies, imagine if his
confirmation had been doomed by the revelation of more unsettling
viewing habits.
New technologies enable people to receive and exchange ideas
differently than they did at the time the Bill of Rights was
drafted.

Personal papers once stored in our homes are now held

by others with whom we do business.
10

Transactional information

may be easily stored and accessed.

Records of our reading and

viewing histories are now maintained by libraries, and cable
television and video companies.

The computer makes possible the

instant assembly of this information.
The ACLU is concerned about the danger posed by the
aggregation of separately compiled lists to create profiles on
individuals.

As Arthur Miller, author of Assault on Privacy.

testified in 1971:
Whenever an American travels on a commercial airline,
reserves a room at one of the national hotel chains, rents a
car, he [or she] is likely to leave distinctive electronic
tracks in the memory of a computer that can tell a great
deal about his [or her] activities, movements, habits and
associations. Unfortunately, few people seem to appreciate
the fact that modern technology is capable of monitoring,
centralizing, and evaluating these electronic entries, no
matter how numerous they may be, making credible the fear
that many Americans have of a womb-to-tomb dossier on each
of us.
{Federal Data Banks. Computers and the Bill of
Rights. Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Constitutional
Rights, Committee on the Judiciary, 2/23/71, p. 9)
That same year, Alan Westin, in his book Data Banks in a Free
Society, argued: "We have seen that most large-scale record
systems in this country are not yet operating with rules about
privacy, confidentiality, and due process that reflect the
updated constitutional ideals and new social values that have
been developing over the past decade."

(p. 398).

The Supreme

Court, echoing these concerns in Whalen v. Roe. 429 U.S. 589
(1977), recognized:
the threat to privacy implicit in the accumulation of vast
amounts of personal information in computerized data banks
or other massive government files....The right to collect
and use such data for public purposes is typically
accompanied by a concomitant statutory or regulatory duty
11

70
to avoid unwarranted disclosures.
[We] recognize that in
some instances that duty arguably has its roots in the
Constitution.
The Supreme Court, however, has been reluctant to expand the
scope of the Fourth Amendment to hold that the Constitutional
right to be secure in one's paper's and effects should extend to
personal information held by others.
435 (1976).

U.S. v. Miller. 425 0.S.

Fortunately, Congress has responded to this pressing

need, acting quickly when First and Fourth Amendment rights have
intersected to establish assertible privacy interests: in the
press offices and files of newspapers (Privacy Protection Act of
1980, 42 u.s.c. 2000(a)(a)); in individual's cable viewing
records (Cable Communications Policy Act, P.L. 98-549); and in
electronic communications (Electronic Communications Privacy Act
of 1984, 18 u.s.c. 2510).

The Video and Library Privacy

Protection Acts of 1988 are the most recent Congressional efforts
to address the heart of an important First Amendment/privacy
issue.

If passed, the legislation will protect our freedom to

think and inquire by creating a substantive zone of privacy
around library and video records.

FEDERAL INFORMATION PRIVACY LEGISLATION
The protection of video and library records is consistent
with the past 18 years of progress in the area of federal
information privacy legislation.
In 1970, Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15
D.S.C. I 1681) prohibiting credit and investigation reporting
12

71
agencies that collect, store and sell Information on consumers'
credit worthiness from disclosing records to anyone other than
authorized customers.

The Act requires the agencies to make

their records available to the record subject and provides
procedures for correcting inaccurate information.

The

legislation created a legal framework in which the reporting
companies could operate and was passed in response to the
public's growing awareness and concern about personal information
maintained by credit reporting bureaus.
Four years later, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (20 U.S.C. I 1232(g)) was enacted, limiting disclosure of
educational records to third parties.

The law requires schools

and colleges to grant students access to their records and
mandates a challenge and correct procedure.
That same year, Congress passed landmark federal privacy
legislation • the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. ( 552a)• to
control the collection, storage, use. and dissemination of
personal information maintained in federal agency record systems.
The passage of the Act came on the heels of the Watergate
scandal, which revealed to the public the extent of the
government's surreptitious information gathering and use.

The

founding principles of the Act are derived from the recommended
federal Code of Fair Information Practices developed by the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare and published in
Records. Computers and Rights of Citizens (1973).

The major

principles of the Code are: the government shall not maintain
13

72
secret records; individuals must know what files are maintained
on them and how they are used; individuals must be able to
correct and update their files; and most importantly, information
obtained for one purpose may not be used for a different purpose
without the individual's consent.

This last principle became the

driving force behind the Privacy Act of 1974 and the legislation
that followed.
The Privacy Act mandated the creation of the Privacy
Protection Study Commission to make a "study of the data banks,
automatic data processing programs, and information systems of
governmental, regional and private organizations, in order to
determine the standards and procedures in force for the
protection of personal information."

Based on its findings, the

Commission was to recommend additional legislation necessary to
protect individuals' personal privacy interests.
In its 1977 report, Personal Privacy in an Information
Society, the Commission concluded that an effective national
information policy must embody three major principles: minimize
intrusiveness, maximize fairness and create legitimate,
enforceable expectations of confidentiality, (pp. 13-21).

The

report outlined the need to protect a wide variety of records,
including insurance, financial, telephone, employment, education,
taxpayer and medical records.

As a general rule, the Commission

recommended, organizations that maintain a confidential record
must be placed under a legal duty not to disclose the record
without the consent of the individual, except in certain limited
14

73
circumstances, such as pursuant to a search warrant or subpoena.
Even in such instances, the individual must have the right to
challenge the court order before disclosure of the record,

(pp.

362-63).
The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401),
a Congressional response to U.S. v. Miller and a direct outgrowth
of the Privacy Commission's report, created an assertible privacy
interest in personal financial records.

The Act provides

individuals with the right to a notice and challenge procedure
with which investigative agencies must comply before records may
be disclosed.
Congress passed the Privacy Protection Act of 1980 (42
U.S.C. | 2000(a)(a)) to prohibit the government from searching
press offices if no one in the office is suspected of committing
a crime.
In 1982, Congress passed the Debt Collection Act (P.L. 97365) requiring federal agencies to provide individuals with due
process protections before an individual's federal debt
information may be referred to a private credit bureau.
The Cable Communications Policy Act (P.L. 98-549), enacted
in 1984, prohibits a cable service from disclosing information
about a subscriber's cable viewing habits without the
individual's consent.

The Act requires the service to inform the

subscriber of the nature and use of information collected, and
disclosures that may be made.

The cable service must also

provide subscribers access to information maintained on them.
15

74
Two years ago. Congress passed the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act (18 u.s.c. I 2510).

The Act amends the federal

wiretap act to prohibit the unauthorized interception and
disclosure of electronic communications made possible by new
technologies, such as cellular phones, electronic mail and
satellite television transmissions.

The passage of ECPA was

supported by a number of industry associations, partly due to
concern about public confidence in using the new systems.
Legislation is currently pending to bring under the wing of
the 1974 Privacy Act the computerized matching of personal
information held in federal agency databases.

For years, the

computerized matching of records has grown outside the scope of
government regulation and oversight.

The legislation, the

computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, passed the
Senate last year by unanimous consent and was recently
out of the House Government Operations Committee.

reported

The ACLU is

optimistic that the legislation will pass, and that the gaping
hole created by the misinterpretation and misapplication of the
Privacy Act's routine use exemption will be partially covered.
The legislation before us today promises to be another
positive Congressional response to the need for protections on
personal, sensitive information.

CONCLUSION
The ACLU is hopeful that the Video and Library Privacy
Protection Act will continue to garner broad, bi-partisan
16

75
support.

We look forward to continuing to work closely with you

to ensure passage of this important and timely legislation.

Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Ms. Goldman.
Now we would like to call on Mr. Vans Stevenson.
Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee, I
appreciate the invitation and opportunity to appear before you
today.
I am Vans Stevenson, Director of Public Relations, Erol's, Inc. As
many of you know, we are a suburban based Washington, DC,
video sales and rental chain and we have 165 stores in eight States
and the District of Columbia. In addition to speaking for my company, I am also appearing on behalf of the Video Software Dealers
Association, which represents video retailers and distributors
throughout the United States. Approximately 20,000 of the 30,000
video retailers in the United States are represented by VSDA.
We would like to commend you, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Simon, Mr. Kastenmeier and Mr. McCandless and your staffs for the hard work
that you went through to put together this important legislation.
We support both bills. We support H.R. 4947 and S. 2361, which
would prohibit the disclosure of individual customer rental or sales
records, except in very limited circumstances. In our view, rental
and sales records are privileged matters between the retailer and
the customer. That is the firm policy of VSDA and its members.
We also agree that there should be certain exceptions to the rule
against disclosure of such records.
First, we feel that an exception is appropriate when it is necessary in the routine course of business, such as when a delinquent
account may require the involvement of a collection agency.
Second, we believe that disclosure is warranted where provided
pursuant to a legal court order for law enforcement purposes. However, this law enforcement exception should be limited; it should be
available only when the law enforcement agency has sufficiently
showed its necessity, and when the customer is given notice and afforded an opportunity to appear and contest such an order.
As for requests made in the context of civil litigation, we recommend the approach in H.R. 4947. Disclosure should not be permitted.
Third, disclosure should also be allowed when a customer has
clearly expressed written, informed consent. This could be either
when the customer fully understands the exact circumstances in
which the records are being requested, or when the customer's
name and address will merely be disclosed as part of a general
mailing list. We agree that this mailing list exception should not be
used if the subject matter of a customer's rental would be indirectly revealed.
Erol's, my company, which is the nation's largest volume specialty retailer, has had a policy for a number of years prohibiting individual account disclosure. Any Erol's employee who violates that
policy faces disciplinary action which could include immediate termination. Fortunately, we have never had to dismiss an employee
for violating the policy.
In addition to strengthening our existing policy, it is our expectation that your committees will provide both courts and video retaili*h guidance in the legislative history as to what kinds of acailers might take to safeguard the privacy of video records,

77

so that they may avoid being unreasonably burdened by the legislation.
The Committee report can provide such guidance. We feel strongly that a video dealer should not be unfairly held liable for the unauthorized acts of an employee which are in clear violation of a
strong and enforced store policy against such authorized disclosure.
The legislation is needed. I am aware of at least three instances
when Erol's has received direct inquiries about individual accounts.
Two were from Government agencies, and one from an attorney
representing a client in a divorce proceeding.
1. A United States Secret Service agent asked if we could release
information about an individual suspected of passing counterfeit
currency. We refused unless ordered by a court of law. We never
received such an order or a further inquiry.
2. An investigator from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development requested account information regarding a Government employee suspected of using a Government vehicle for personal use during work hours. The HUD official said he
suspected the employee was checking out tapes at one of our stores
during working hours. We refused the request for information.
There was never any followup call.
3. An attorney in a divorce proceeding requested the rental
records of the defendant in the case. We refused. A subpoena was
threatened but never served.
Mr. LEAHY. Did the attorney give any reason of why that would
be valid, of what his reason was for wanting it?
Mr. STEVENSON. He never gave me any reason. He asked if the
individual was a member, which we don't disclose either, and,
number two, if the record was available. I asked him why and he
didn't really make any comment and he said I will be back to you.
and we haven't heard anything.
Mr. LEAHY. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. STEVENSON. Let me review several other instances that we
are aware of, and this is from around the country.
An attempt by the attorney for a spouse in a divorce proceeding
to show, through video records that the other spouse was an unfit
parent. The records were refused.
A subpoena served by the attorney of one defendant in criminal
prosecution who sought the video records of is client's co-defendants. The store did not comply with the subpoena. The attorney did
not pursue the matter and the co-defendants were acquitted.
A law enforcement agency subpoena seeking from a video store
the video records of all of its customers, in the context of a question about local community standards for an obscenity prosecution.
Here again, the records were refused and the subpoena was not
passed.
Record sought by a defendant in a civil child molestation case,
who sought to show that plaintiffs themselves had stimulated the
children's fantasies by virtue of the movies shown in the home.
As you have pointed out, there have been attempts reported in
the press to obtain the video records of public figures, such as Government officials.

78

These incidents suffice to put the Congress on notice about this
serious potential for invasion of privacy and chilling of the exercise
of the First Amendment right to view films free from fear of harassment or adverse publicity. Many State and local laws do not
provide adequate protection. Congress should act.
While the attempts to obtain customer records were successfully
rebuffed in the instances I have referred to, there is always the
threat of efforts to judicially enforce subpoenas seeking disclosure.
Home video dealers should not have to face potential liability for
failure to comply with a subpoena, on the one hand, or lawsuits by
their customers because they have complied, on the other hand.
Because we feel strongly about protecting the privacy of our customers and upholding the law, we are also concerned about consistency between Federal and State legislation currently in effect. As
video dealers, we would like clear guidance as to which legal requirement would apply in case of conflicting standards.
We applaud the proposed bills to formally protect a reasonable
right of privacy for the video customer. We believe that the legislation will help to strengthen our company's policy as well as similar
policies practiced by the other video retailers in VSDA.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee
for the opportunity to speak to you today on behalf of both Erol's,
Inc., and the Video Software Dealers Association.
I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you very much, Mr. Stevenson.

SUMMARY OF
TESTIMONY OF VANS STEVENSON
FOR THE
VIDEO SOFTWARE DEALERS ASSOCIATION AND EROL'S, INC.
ON
HOME VIDEO RECORD PRIVACY LEGISLATION
August 3, 1988

79
SOMMART
The Video Software Dealers Association is the largest
national trade association for retail home video dealers and
video distributors.
Its members operate some 20,000 of the
30,000 home video retail outlets in the country.
EROL'S, Inc., is a suburban Washington, D.C.-based
video sale and rental retail chain with 165 stores in nine
states and the District of Columbia.
VSDA and its members, including EROL'S, believe that
the privacy of their customers' video records should be
respected and preserved, except for very narrowly drawn
statutory exemptions. That is VSDA's policy and we generally
support legislative efforts to reinforce that policy,
including the two bills before your subcommittees.
We agree that there should be carefully drawn
exceptions for disclosure in the case of customer consent,
ordinary business practice, or a strong showing that it is
essential in a law enforcement proceeding.
It is our understanding that your committees will
provide some guidance to the courts and to video retailers
regarding the steps that retailers might take to safeguard
record privacy.
The pattern of requests for records, through
subpoenas in criminal or civil proceedings and from
journalistic inquiries, indicates the need for Congressional
action. The trend toward increased efforts at disclosure
puts Congress on notice about the serious potential for
invasion of privacy and chilling of the exercise of First
Amendment rights.
Video dealers should not have to face potential
liability for failure to comply with a subpoena, on the one
hand, or lawsuits brought by customers because they have
complied, on the other.
The proposed legislation will strengthen the policy
practiced by VSDA dealers of maintaining customer privacy,
and thereby protect the free exercise of First Amendment
rights.

H.R. 4947
VIDEO PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT
DRAFT TESTIMONY
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you
for the invitation and opportunity to appear before you
today.

My name is Vans Stevenson.

I am Director of Public

Relations for EROL'S, Inc., a suburban Washington, D.C.-based
video sale and rental retail chain with 165 stores in nine
states and the District of Columbia.

In addition to speaking

for my company, I am also appearing on behalf of the Video
Software Dealers' Association, which represents video
retailers and distributors throughout the United States.
Approximately 20,000 of the 30,000 video retailers in the
United States are represented by VSDA.
We support H.R. 4947 and S. 2361, which would
prohibit the disclosure of individual customer rental or
sales records, except in very limited circumstances.

In our

view, rental and sales records are privileged matters between
the retailer and the customer.

That is the firm policy of

VSDA and its members.
We also agree that there should be certain exceptions
to the rule against disclosure of such records.
First, we feel that an exception is appropriate when
it is necessary in the routine course of business, such as
when a delinquent account may require the involvement of a
collection agency.

82
Second, we believe that disclosure is warranted where
provided pursuant to a legal court order for law enforcement
purposes. However, this law enforcement exception should be
limited; it should be available only when the law enforcement
agency has sufficiently showed its necessity, and when the
customer is given notice and afforded an opportunity to
appear and contest such an order.
A potential problem in the bill's exception for
criminal law enforcement lies in the bill's requirement that
the user be "given notice and afforded an opportunity to
appear and contest such order."

See S 2710(d)(1)(A).

The

bill does not designate who is responsible for giving the
notice to the customer.

It is important that the law

enforcement agency have that responsibility so that the
dealer does not become involved in any conflict between the
user's privacy rights and the law enforcement agency's
alleged need for disclosure.
As for requests made in the context of civil
litigation, we recommend the approach in H.R. 4947.
Disclosure should not be permitted.
Third, disclosure should also be allowed when a
customer has clearly expressed written, informed consent.
This could be either when the customer fully understands the
exact circumstances in which the records are being requested,

83
or when the customer's name and address will merely be
disclosed as part of a general mailing list.

We agree that

this mailing list exception should not be used if the subject
matter of a customer's rental would be indirectly revealed.
EROL'S, which is the nation's largest volume
specialty retailer, has had a policy for a number of years
prohibiting individual account disclosure.

Any EROL'S

employee who violates that policy faces disciplinary action
which could include immediate termination.

We have never had

to dismiss an employee for violating the policy.
In addition to strengthening our existing policy, it
is our expectation that your committees will provide both
courts and video retailers with guidance in the legislative
history as to what kinds of actions retailers might take to
safeguard the privacy of video records, so that they may
avoid being unreasonably burdened by the legislation.

The

We feel strongly

that a video dealer should not be unfairly held liable for
the unauthorized acts of an employee which are in clear
violation of a strong and enforced store policy against such
authorized disclosure.
The legislation is needed.

I am aware of at least

three instances when EROL'S has received direct inquiries
about individual accounts.

We refused unless ordered by a

We never received such an order or a further

inquiry.
2.

An investigator from the United States

Department of Housing and Urban Development requested account
information regarding a government employee suspected of
using a government vehicle for personal use during work
hours.

The HUD official said he suspected the employee was

checking out tapes at one of our stores during working hours.
We refused the request for information.
3.

An attorney in a divorce proceeding requested

the rental records of the defendant in the case.

We refused.

A subpoena was threatened but never served.
Other home video retail businesses have encountered
similar inquiries.

These instances of efforts to obtain

video store records include:
An attempt by the attorney for a spouse in a
divorce proceeding to show, through video
records that the other spouse was an unfit
parent.

The records were refused.

•

A subpoena served by the attorney of one
defendant in criminal prosecution who sought the
video records of his client's co-defendants.
The store did not comply with the subpoena.

The

attorney did not pursue the matter and the codefendants were acquitted.
•

A law enforcement agency subpoena seeking from a
video store the video records of all of its
customers, in the context of a question about
local community standards for an obscenity
prosecution.

Here again, the records were

refused and the subpoena was not pressed.

Records sought by a defendant in a civil child
molestation case, who sought to show that
plaintiffs themselves had stimulated the
childrens' fantasies by virtue of the movies
shown in the home.

There have also been attempts reported in the press
to obtain the video records of public figures, such as
government officials.

about this serious potential for invasion of privacy and
chilling of the exercise of the first amendment right to view
films free from fear of harassment or adverse publicity.

Congress should act.
While the attempts to obtain customer records were
successfully rebuffed in the instances I have referred to,
there is always the threat of efforts to judically enforce
subpoenas seeking disclosure.

Home video dealers should not

have to face potential liability for failure to comply with a
subpoena, on the one hand, or lawsuits by their customers
because they have complied, on the other hand.
Because we feel strongly about protecting the privacy
of our customers and upholding the law, we are also concerned
about consistency between federal and state legislation
currently in effect.

As video dealers, we would like clear

guidance as to which legal requirement would apply in case of
conflicting standards.
We applaud the proposed bills to formally protect a
reasonable right of privacy for the video customer.

We

believe that the legislation will help to strengthen our
company's policy as well as similar policies practiced by the
other video retailers in VSDA.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and Members of the
Committee for the opportunity to speak to you today on behalf
of both EROL'S, Inc. and the Video Software Dealers
Association.
I will be pleased to answer any questions you may
have.

Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Richard Barton.
Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, and I
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Incidentally, without objection, your statements collectively will appear in their entirety as submitted to the
committee, even if you have summarized your remarks.
Mr. BARTON [continuing]. Mr. Chairman, and members of the two
subcommittees, it is real pleasure to be here today. I hope I can say
this after the testimony, since you know, I am going to take a little
bit different tack than the other witnesses here.
Before I begin, I would like the indulgence of the subcommittee
to introduce a very prominent person in our industry, Alexander
Hoffman, who is sitting right over here. He is the recently retired
group vice-president of Doubleday, Incorporated and former Chairman of the Direct Marketing Association. He was one of the spearheads of the Direct Marketing Association's activities in the privacy area in connection with the Privacy Protection Study Commission, and afterwards, which I think dramatizes that we are very
concerned about the privacy issues raised here and about the general concerns of the American public in privacy.
We want to cooperate with the subcommittees, and we have been
working with the staffs. We are very concerned about the privacy
issues that have been raised here by the other three witnesses, and
we agree that the specific instances which they cite in most cases
are things that should be prevented either by law or certainly by
practice within their industries.
We do not agree that Judge Bork's personal preferences for video
tapes should have been released. We do not agree that specific
titles and reading habits of specific individuals should be released
from libraries. But this bill, we believe, goes far beyond remedying
the ills which gave rise to the original bills.
The language of the two bills would actually have a significant
impact on what heretofore has been considered the completely legitimate and accepted marketing practice of a major segment of
American industry. That is the direct marking industry. We believe that the bills misunderstand or really don t address the question of how mailing lists are used and how mailing lists are put together, in fact, even physically what mailing lists are.
Mailing lists as such do not contain specific data about specific
individuals. They are lists, they are aggregates of people, usually
on computer tape which we don't even see who may have common
characteristics such as income, buying patterns, places where they
live, life style and what is important here for the subject matter of
this hearing, either vocational or avocational interests which indicate that they might be receptive to receiving a specific offer or
contributing to a specific charity or for that matter supporting of
specific political candidate.
Companies, we agree, do have the knowledge of specific buying
habits of their customers in the same way that Erol's does and the
same way libraries do, but this is not translated onto a mailing list.
The only physical manifestation that comes out of the mailing lists
is a piece of paper with a name and address on it that goes on an
envelope or a catalog.
There is no specific information which is given out by a mailing
list. To make an important point, there is no complaint that I

88

know of, at least in the history of the Direct Marketing Association
involvement in issues like this, that specific information about specific individuals has been given out from the mailing lists and for
mailings.
In 1977 the Privacy Protection Study Commission which was
cited by the ACLU favorably, maybe not this part of it, but other
parts, agreed with the industry, the compilation and use of mailing
lists did not invade anyone's privacy and should not be legislated
against.
But even before the Privacy Protection Study Commission, in
1971, the Direct Marketing Association realizing people's growing
concerns about privacy, developed an industry-wide mail preference service, administered even to this day by the Direct Marketing Association to allow people to get off mailing lists.
We have advertised that program very, very broadly throughout
the country with hundreds of millions of impressions of advertisements in magazines and newspapers and dealing with people like
Action Line editors and consumer groups.
It has been endorsed by organizations such as U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs and the National Council of Better Business Bureaus. We also began at that time another successful program to
insist that companies which rent their lists give the customers an
opportunity to have their names deleted.
We believe fervently in that principle and that is recognized in
the two bills that are being considered before us today. So we do
believe that people should have the opportunity to get off of a mailing list. We promote that nationally. But we do not believe that
mailing lists and the use of mailing lists per se is a violation of
anyone's privacy rights. There is some specific language I would
like to approach in both bills that gave us great difficulty.
First, the current language in both, I believe, prohibits any disclosure which would directly or indirectly disclose the character of
the video tape rented. As I said before, it has generally been understood that there is no harm in the commercial use of the character
of the material rented on a mailing list.
It doesn't invade somebody's privacy to put the person on a mailing list because he may have or she may have rented classic westerns or video tapes about workouts or whatever. Pick a subject. Especially when the individual has the power to stop such rental if he
or she chooses.
If he ran a golf video club list or a sailing list, you can make a
fairly safe assumption that that person on the list has interests in
those specific matters. We think it is legitimate to market to these
people, but the effect of this legislation would be to prohibit the use
of these lists unless affirmative consent of the consumer is obtained, which frankly is tantamount to prohibition for use of these
lists.
Therefore, under the proposed legislation a general list can be
rented, but a list that indicates their interests, at least as far as
video tapes are concerned, can't or at least practically can't be. As
I said, it has been generally established that there is very•no real
privacy interest in renting the names of customers and their general interests.

89
Finally, we are concerned with the requirement in the House bill
which requires a person to check a yes box and return it to the
direct marketing company before his name be•may appear on the
list. We are in the business of marketing our products and services.
Studies have shown that non-sales related information in separate notices and things of that nature significantly decreases response. It is not that we don't want to do this. We will do it and we
have included in our testimony, many, many examples of many
companies, public interest organizations such as consumers union
and the American Express, which is mentioned here, which give
people this opportunity.
But the Privacy Protection Study Commission itself recognized
there is a great deal of diversity in the direct marketing business
and there is•there should be flexibility in how we provide the
notice. We would like that kind of flexibility.
In closing, I think that just two thoughts here, three thoughts, I
guess. One is we do think that this bill should be limited to the
evils which everybody described, which deal with libraries and in
this specific case revealing of information from the rental of video
tapes from retail stores.
Secondly, we do not believe that the simple existence of a mailing list and mailing to customers because of particular interests
they may have violates privacy. And, third, we would like to have
the flexibility within the context of the bill in order to be able to
rent our specialty lists. We want to sincerely and strongly thank
the two subcommittees for hearing this testimony, and we are looking forward to working with you in the future, as we have in the
past on issues of great concern to us all.
Thank you.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you very much, Mr. Barton. Your remarks conclude the prepared testimony.

SUMMARY OF TESTIMONY OF RICHARD A. BARTON
The Direct Marketing Association ("DMA") has been
carefully following the Video and Library Privacy Protection
Act of 1988 and agree that the public disclosure of Robert
Bork's video rental choices should not have been made.

It is

our hope that we can support a legislative remedy to that
problem.

However, it is with much regret that I have to say

that given its current coverage of direct marketing, DMA and
its members will have to oppose this legislation.
The direct marketing industry shares this committee's
concern that personal privacy be protected in the use of video
customer information lists and pledges that our industry will
continue its successful seventeen year effort to further the
privacy interests of our customers.

DMA started its privacy

efforts in 1972 and has spent much time, money and effort to
inform the public of its mail preference system.

We believe

that as the result of these efforts and the notices placed in
consumer material by most marketers that the public is aware of
its ability to restrict the use of names for marketing
purposes.
In summary, we contend, however, in the context of
video that this legislation should be limited to retail rental
establishments.

Further, we believe that any person renting or

exchanging a mailing list should be able to describe the
character or the nature of the video rented, e.g. sports video
as long as the customer is given the opportunity to object to
the sale or exchange of the customer's name.

92
TESTIMONY
Good morning, my name is Richard A. Barton, and I am
Senior Vice President of the Direct Marketing Association
responsible for government relations.

DMA has been carefully

following the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act of 1988
and agree that the public disclosure of Judge Robert Bork's
video rental choices should not have been made.

It is our hope

that we can support a legislative remedy to that problem.
However, it is with much regret that I have to say that given
its current coverage of direct marketing, DMA and its members
will have to oppose this legislation.
As currently drafted, this legislation adversely
affects the direct marketer's most important business asset:
the mailing list.

There is no evidence that direct marketing

companies have done what was done to Judge Bork or anything
else adverse to its customers.

We do not publicly disclose

information about what a person buys.

We have a 17-year-old

system in place whereby customers may have their names removed
from our lists.

I will discuss this system in a moment.

We do

not feel that our legitimate commercial activities need to be
regulated by a bill whose purpose it is to protect consumers
from an abuse which we have not committed.
The direct marketing industry shares this committee's
concern that personal privacy be protected in the use of video
customer information and pledges that our industry will

- 2 -

continue its successful seventeen year effort to further the
privacy interests of our customers.

DMA started its privacy

efforts in 1972 and has spent much time, money and effort to
infc.m the public of its mail preference system.

We believe

that as the result of these efforts and the notices placed in
consumer material by most marketers that the public is aware of
its ability to restrict the use of names for marketing
purposes.

This process of name removal or Mail Preference

Service ("MPS") has been endorsed by the President's Office of
Consumer Affairs, the Better Business Bureau and consumer
officials in many states.
MPS services.

Most of our members have their own

Examples of how these companies notify their

customers of how to have their names removed from lists are
attached to my testimony.
In summary, we contend, however, in the context of
video, that this legislation should be limited to retail rental
establishments.

Further, we believe that any person renting or

exchanging a mailing list should be able to describe the
character or the nature of the video rented, e.g. sports video
as long as the customer is given the opportunity to object to
the exchange or rental of the customer's name.
DMA has nearly 3000 member firms nationwide which
represent every functional level of industry • manufacturing,
wholesale and retail.

These companies market goods and

services through direct response methods, including direct mail

94

advertising and mailing lists.

As a measure of direct

marketing's economic importance and consumer acceptance,
consumer sales volume from catalogs alone are estimated to be
in the tens of billions of dollars.

The direct marketing

industry makes a major economic impact through increased sales
of goods and services.

In addition, the direct marketing

industry itself is a major contributor to increased employment.
Video tapes are emerging as a major element of the
marketing business.

The new traditional video tape version of

movies are being sold through the mail as well as educational
and instructional material.

Everything from exercising to

cooking to gardening to entertainment is finding its way onto
videotape.

A rapidly growing amount of all video tapes in the

United States are sold directly to consumers through the mail.
Privacy is not a new concept to the direct marketing
industry.

We not only protect our customers against

unauthorized disclosures, we give them an opportunity to
restrict our members from renting or exchanging their names.
Typically, a direct marketer as shown in the attached examples
will notify its customers that mailing lists containing their
names and addresses may be exchanged or rented and they are
given the opportunity to limit or restrict such disclosure.

In

addition, through mail preference a consumer may contact DMA
and we will distribute their names to any list marketer or
broker who requests it, including members and non-members, who
in return will eliminate those consumers names from any
solicitations that they make.

95
A -

Video mailing lists rented or exchanged do not contain
a list of titles purchased.

They simply state how many times

an individual purchased through the mail in a preceding time
period.

In some instances the lists may indicate a subject

preference, e.g. sports.

There is no doubt that direct

marketing companies, like retail stores, know what a customer
has purchased.

And there is no doubt that direct marketing

companies use this information in an attempt to increase
sales.

Companies in our industry want to know about a person's

interest to be better able to market products to that person.
If you are a hiker, changes are you would be interested in a
catalogue selling camping or fly fishing equipment.
a gardener, you might want to buy bulbs or seed.
handyman, you might want to buy more tools.

If you are

If you are a

And if you watch

videos at home on your VCR, you might want to buy more
videos...or home electronics...or books.

These lists are

closely controlled and they are used only for marketing
purpose.

They cannot be accessed over the counter and are

maintained with a high degree of security.
In contrast, a video store primarily rents video
entertainment films.

As a result they keep a more detailed

record of an individual to protect themselves in case the
customer does not return the videos.

It was these rental

records which were released for non-marketing purposes in Mr.
Bork's case.

In terms of unauthorized access to the name and habits
of our customers, we simply are unaware of any instance, even
an isolated one, where a name of a direct market consumer has
found its way any place except onto a mailing label back to
consumers.

We do not believe that this practice of list rental

and exchange raises privacy issues.

Others after looking at

this issue including the U.S. Privacy Protection Study
Commission have concluded that receiving mail in itself does
not raise privacy concerns.
In July of 1977, some five years after we began our own
effort, the United States Privacy Protection Study Commission
issued the most comprehensive report ever done in this country
on privacy.

It studied the direct marketing industry

extensively and concluded that:
That a person engaged in interstate
commerce who maintains a mailing list
should not be required by law to remove
an individual's name and address from
such a list upon request of that
individual, except as already provided
by law.
The Commission went on to state however, that an
organization should afford its customers the opportunity to
restrict the use of their names.

The Commission believed that

a voluntary approach would be successful.

We believe that our

MPS system and those of our individual members have been very
successful and that the direct marketing industry has protected
its customers from the very abuses which prompted this
legislation.

97

The proposed legislation covers direct marketers as
well as retail stores on the theory that the disclosure of
video tape selections is a practice that warrants legislative
protection and if it is warranted for retail stores than the
same restrictions should apply to anyone who distributes video
tapes to consumers by other means.

This we believe is bad

privacy theory.
The Privacy Commission and subsequent legislative
activities in the privacy arena all focus on the relationship
between the record keeper and the subject of that record.
Congress in 1984 as part of a cable reform package included a
cable subscriber privacy section because of the concern that it
had at that time with the developing central role of a cable
company.

Not only could a cable operator learn of you movie

selections, it could discover when during the day or night you
watched that movie.

Congress acted on its concern that the

cable operator was a new institution with no established track
record of protecting consumer's privacy rights. Also, the cable
industry sought the legislation.
More recently, in landmark legislation, both of these
subcommittees passed the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act.

That statute recognizes the special role of remote

computing services in our society and established very strong
requirements concerning the release of information from such
services. Also, the remote computing industry sought the
legislation.

Here the video store industry has sought this
legislation in light of the publicity resulting from the
unauthorized disclosure of Judge Bork's records.

The library

community has also sought legislation because of the abuse of
their libraries by law enforcement officials through library
awareness programs.
In stark contrast, there is no record to support any
legislative action directly affecting direct marketing.

Given

the industry's unblemished seventeen year history of compliance
with privacy guestions, we seriously question the need to
legislate our business.

We strongly request that we be given

the continued opportunity to respond voluntarily to the
challenge of privacy.
Moreover, this legislation is also too restrictive in
terms of its limitation on the sale or rental of mailing lists
where the individual has been notified that his or her name may
be rented.

The current language prohibits any disclosure which

would directly or indirectly disclose the character of the
video tape rented.

We agree that this alternative consent

procedure should not be used to disclose the specific titles
rented.

We do not see the harm in the commercial use of the

character of the material rented.

It does not invade someone's

privacy to find out that he or she has rented classic movies or
westerns, especially when the individual has the power to stop
such disclosure if he or she chooses.

99

This indirect and direct language is also troubling
where the list is a specialty list.

If you rent a golf video

club list or the sailing club video tape list, you can make a
fairly safe assumption as to the character of the video tape
rented. The effect of this legislation will to prohibit the use
of these lists unless the affirmative consent of the customer
is obtained, which is tantamount to a prohibition on the
disclosure of such lists.

Therefore, under the proposed

legislation, a general list may be rented but a specialty list
may not.

We do not see the privacy interest in renting the

name of customers and their general interest as long as they
have been given the opportunity through alternative consent to
stop disclosure of their names in the first place.
Finally, we are extremely concerned with the
requirement in the House bill which requires a person to check
a "yes" box and return it to the direct marketing company
before his or her name may appear on a list.

Direct marketing

companies are doing just that...marketing products and/or
services to consumers.

Any card or notice which is to be

filled out by a potential customer is very carefully designed
to promote sales.

Studies have shown that non-sales related

information significantly decreases response.
This argument was made to the Privacy Commission some
ten years ago and they too agreed that the direct marketing
industry is very diverse and what may work in one context may

100
- 9

not work in another.

Therefore, the Privacy Commission

recommended flexibility in how notice and opportunity are
given.

Requiring a box, is we believe, an unnecessarily

specific requirement to be assured that a customer has been
given adequate notice.

We have attached many examples of mail

preference notices and we believe that the variety of
approaches demonstrated by those notices should be continued.
We also believe that our industry is the beneficiary of
the First Amendment and the developing commercial free speech
doctrines of the U.S. Constitution.

We will not detail those

arguments now, but simply state our interest for the record.
We continue to support the efforts of these Committees
in connection with privacy and look forward to your continued
work.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify on these

important issues.

Mr. KASTENMEIER. I would now like to yield to the Senator from
Vermont, Mr. Leahy.
Mr. LEAHY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Barton, let me ask you a couple questions, because I did talk
about some of the basic premises and concerns that we share. We
shouldn't be able to have just anybody come waltzing in and find
out what you watch or what I watch or what your neighbors watch
or don't watch. And I understand the interest you have in being
able to develop indirect market techniques and mailing lists.
Let me give you an example of some of the things that concern
me. I have three children. One is a young teen, who sent in for a
manual on karate or kung fu or whatever all the kids were doing
at that time.
It came to him. The label on it had something unique about it. I
believe it had one letter off or something like that, but the thing
came and it was an innocuous thing about how to teach yourself
karate or whatever. He probably looked at it for 10 minutes in a
typical kid's fashion and then threw it away to be forgotten. But
what wasn't forgotten was the next 6 or 7 months.
I mean, I don t know what getting a karate manual triggers, but
I couldn't believe the stuff that started coming to this teenager. It
ranged from the Soldier of Fortune type ads to some of the most
prurient lingerie things I have ever seen. There were ads for Xrated books, videos, and something that came very close to how to
kill your neighbor. And I'm serious, it seems to have triggered all
of these things.
You know, it wasn't ads from "Sports Illustrated" or "Fish and
Game Weekly" or something like that. I mean, these are wild sorts
of things. We finally came to the point where my wife and I kept
going down to the Postmaster and just kept bringing these things
and filing that little form to take your name off the list, which was
semi-effective.
We still get them. Not as many, probably only because we have
changed our address and some of them have finally stopped.
Now, you said that you don't object to limiting the disclosure of
specific titles of videos. But you disagree with limiting the disclosure of the subject matter of videos.
That is where I have a problem. What triggers from that subject
matter? We are talking more and more sophistication with computers and with profiles of people. And politicians do this, too, on profiles of voters and everything else. But how much should we be allowed to profile somebody?
What does it trigger to someone, if I watch old westerns, or if I
watch only comedies or whatever? Should I really have to think
that somewhere, somebody is building up a profile on me based on
my personal habits, when I have no control over it? Wouldn't it
make far more sense to say if I want them to do it, let me affirmatively ask to be put on a list. Not the other way around, that I am
going to be on that list unless I think enough to ask for my name
to be taken off?
Really, I have this vision of big brother, where somebody sits at a
massive computer•somebody whom I have never seen, never will
meet in my life•but that person can kind of figure out that Patrick Leahy is this sort of person based on what he reads or what he

116
thinks or what he views and, therefore, he gets pegged a certain
way and we are now going to bring whatever the marketing tools
are available against him.
Do you see my concern?
Mr. BARTON. It is a very very broad question.
Mr. LEAHY. YOU don't have to answer yes or no.
Mr. BARTON. I understand exactly what you are talking about.
Your comments go way beyond what I consider privacy issues.
They go into the whole issue of the amounts of mail you get, the
types of mail you get, whether you are comfortable with it, whether you like it and also the vague or maybe more specific feeling as
time goes on that there is somebody out there who knows a tremendous amount about you. You are uncomfortable about it, and I
would be, too.
In the specific instance you used, and I have no idea who karate
clubs rent their list to, but I think you gave us a pretty good example.
Mr. LEAHY. The worst part is they misdelivered it to our neighbors and they said, "you got some more of that mail." Thank you
very much.
Mr. BARTON. They must be Republicans. I would say first of all,
even if it was uncomfortable and you didn't like it, your son's privacy itself was not being invaded because there was nobody sitting
in these companies who knew that your son specifically had gotten
a piece of pornographic literature or so forth.
His name exists on a huge computer tape and it is difficult or
impossible to get Mr. Leahy's name, and yes, he did do this. It is
just not done and often can't be done. Very difficult to do that. In
the second case, in terms of the rental of an awful lot of lists, that
is a subject that our industry is broaching. And I don't think you
can legislate against receiving a lot of mail. But it is of concern.
The best I can say right now is the amount of mail you get and
the number of lists you rent, and all that, is something which probably has to be handled through the marketplace because we think,
as we get more sophisticated in being able to deliver messages to
customers, that in fact that problem will be reduced.
In the case of mail you don't want to receive, such as pornographic mail, and that mail that you describe as you went down to
the post office to get your names off the list. There is a mechanism
to do that, which is somewhat effective, as you say. We get into a
lot of difficulties and we would like to find out to protect people,
too. The definition of obscenity and pornography and things of that
nature are very difficult ones. That is not a direct answer to your
question, but
Mr. LEAHY. Please understand, Mr. Barton, and I am sympathetic with your views, too. My parents had a business in Vermont that
depended on advertising and I understand the concern. I realize
how the marketplace works.
A lot of the mail you get and I get and•maybe you don't want to
have to admit this•but a lot of us look at it and it goes in the
wastebasket. The companies, of course, that do that have to figure
how effective they can be. That is fine. And if they are not effective, they go out of business.

117
A lot of mail I get is ads. I might look at something and say this
is a good idea and I will buy it and it proves a service to me. So, I
don't object to that.
What I am objecting to is that somewhere a profile builds up of
Patrick Leahy or Robert Bork. I am concerned that somewhere
based on very direct personal choices on what we read, watch, and
think, that somebody builds a profile that is nobody's business
except ours and that somebody is able to go into that profile and
determine who we are and what we are, based on what we have
done in total privacy.
When we read a book, when we watch a video, that is something
that should be our choice and our business and nobody else's in the
country. That is what I am concerned about and that is why I
worked hard on this legislation, so that somebody can't penetrate
my privacy or Judge Bork's privacy or anybody else's privacy.
Mr. BARTON. I understand that. And I think that we can probably work out some language in the subcommittee in which the
kind of profiling you are concerned about can't be tapped into.
Now, I don't believe and I probably will get many of my member
companies to jump on me about this, I don't believe the kind of
profile you are talking about truly exists as a result of renting various lists.
If you get a piece of mail from XYZ magazine, that probably has
been a combination of several lists they have rented which indicates that the people they are sending to may have a certain
income, certain interests and so forth.
You can't go into that mailing list and do a specific profile.
There are sort of assumptions made when rentals are made in
which that specific kind of information doesn't exist in a specific
profile. Now, in an individual company, you have profiles of your
customers as any retail company has.
Any time I charge to Woodward & Lothrop, Woodies knows everything I buy and my buying patterns. They can advertise to that
if they so desire. They don't let people know what that profile is,
and I think we can prevent that kind of information from being released, without preventing, within reasonable areas, without preventing a marketing company or a store, whatever it is, to be able
to appeal to that person's interest.
Mr. LEAHY. I think
Mr. BARTON. It is a very difficult issue.
Mr. LEAHY. It is, and Mr. Barton, I respect your concerns, and I
don't want to trample on free enterprise here, but this is one issue
we are going to have to deal with. What happens with interactive
television when, in the next generation we are going to be doing so
much more by using telephone lines, and televisions to pay bills
and buy food, and maybe run the lights in our houses. If somebody
wants to spin out the Orwellian theory, you can have this view of
knowing what time I leave the house, what time I come back, how
much I get paid, when I get paid, whether I pay my bills on time or
I am late on some others, what I like to eat, what I am entertaining and everything.
You know, it is almost like having somebody in the dark with
binoculars sitting outside your house and it is a little bit chilling.
You don't mean to say that we have reached that point, but these

118
are the concerns that we have, and we will continue to work with
you and the organization to tread our way through this.
Mr. BARTON. We worked with you all 2, 3 years ago on the Cable
Privacy Bill. There we were dealing with a new technology which
had great potential. I think we worked at it from a direct marketing viewpoint. We worked out a satisfactory compromise in which
we could use to a certain limited extent the list without revealing
specific information.
I think we are sort of falteringly stepping towards, from our industry's viewpoint, what is an expanded approach on this.
Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate your efforts in working that out. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr.
Coble.
Mr. COBLE. I thank the Chairman.
Ms. Goldman, do you disagree with the 1977 recommendations of
the Privacy Commission, that direct marketing be left to voluntary
compliance or to be more specific, the private industry police and
regulate themselves.
Ms. GOLDMAN. One of the things that the Commission said in
1977 is that direct marketers use a number of different methods
and at that early stage it didn't really make sense for them to recommend legislation, but what the Privacy Commission did find
(and I am reading from the Commission report), after looking at
the mailing list operations, is that among the record-keeping organizations that maintain records about individuals, about whom
they have a direct relationship, it is a common practice to allow
names and addresses to be used without telling the individuals.
"The Commission finds no overwhelming societal justification for
such a state of affairs" and in fact they opposed any organization
allowing that kind of complete discretion in the rental use of the
mailing lists. The Commission also said that with the increased
technology they were very concerned about some of the more troubling potentials that we could realize from the use of the mailing
lists.
The Commission did look at the issue, and they did express concern. They did stop short of recommending legislation in this area,
but they did say that they were very concerned about the future in
this area, and now, 10 or 11 years later, we see that things that
they were concerned about have occurred and that now is the time
to recommend legislation.
I don't know what they would do if they still existed to look at
this issue. But they did raise the concern.
Mr. COBLE. You want equal time, Mr. Barton?
Mr. BARTON. We work with the ACLU on many issues and we
generally agree. This one we don't agree on. In the first place, concerns have been expressed but not any specifics. I do not know of
any specific case in 17 years that we have been involved in privacy
programs that the kind of information we are talking about has
been revealed.
I don't know of any and I would like to see a record on it. I think
our industry's record has been almost unparalled in that area. Secondly
Mr. COBLE. Repeat what you just said.

119
Mr. BARTON. NO information of the type we have been talking
about, to my knowledge, of specific information or profiles about
specific individuals released to law enforcement agencies or newspaper reporters or anyone, for that matter. As far as I know, there
is no record of that ever having happened.
And that is a strong statement to make, because I could be
proven wrong, but I do not believe I am wrong. And, secondly, our
response to these concerns has been to redouble the industry effort
to explain privacy concerns to our customers and to really strongly
encourage both our companies and our own association to allow
people to get off of lists.
I think that that program has been very successful. Pick up most
catalogs that you get and virtually every one of them, they have
notices there that they will take you off our list. We will not run
your name on any specific or general list, if you don't want us to.
So I believe, first, that we have been successful in meeting the concerns of the privacy protection study situation, and secondly, in
terms of mailing lists, I will emphasize that, that there hasn't been
any evidence and in fact anyone's privacy that it has been violated.
Mr. COBLE. I was going to get into evidence of abuse. If anybody
has any information about that, I would be happy to hear it now,
Mr. Chairman, or subsequently.
Mr. Stevenson, as a practical matter, are you or other colleagues
of yours in your industry, as a policy matter, divulging information
upon request?
Mr. STEVENSON. NO, we are not. And I guess I would like to point
out, too, there is no pattern of abuse in the retail, on the retail side
either. There are several instances that we are aware of, but if I go
back over the last 7 years in the 100 million tapes that Erol's has
rented, we have three instances of requests, that I am aware of,
and we have never divulged information.
If someone calls us and says somebody is going to rent an apartment, can you give us some credit history? We won't even reveal if
a person is a member of Erol's, because you have to be a member
of the club, quite obviously, to rent tapes, as many of you know.
Mr. COBLE. This question, Mr. Stevenson, is one•I am not interrogating. I am just asking out of curiosity.
Has public opinion over the Bork incident affected rentals significantly one way or the other? Can you tell that?
Mr. STEVENSON. Well, since that•there are a lot of things that
affect rentals, but our business is about 30 percent ahead of the
same period last year, so it really hasn't affected it. We did have a
handful of phone calls from people that were concerned, but it was
insignificant out of 800,000 members.
Mr. COBLE. Good to have the panel here.
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. BARTON. I mentioned as an aside, I think half that 30 percent in the business has been from my family.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from California, Mr. Berman.
Mr. BERMAN. I know where the other half has been. I would like
to ask the ACLU to explain a little bit what the concept of privacy
from the ACLU point of view is. Is it a sense of the right to not
have one's space invaded?

120
Is Senator Leahy's privacy invaded by all of that mail that is
coming from groups that bought the Kung Fu mailing list?
Are my constituents' space invaded when they write me letters
saying take me off your darned mailing list? Is their privacy right
being invaded by that or is it the public disclosure of information
about me, or the private disclosure to others that do not consent?
Give me a sense of what privacy right we are talking about here.
Ms. GOLDMAN. YOU touched on a number of issues that came up
during this hearing. One is that the right to privacy is not just the
right to be left alone, but it is the right to be able to live certain
areas of our lives outside of the public eye.
Mr. BERMAN. IS the right to be left alone?
Ms. GOLDMAN. It is more than just that. It is the right to be left
alone, but is also the right to be able to conduct certain areas of
our lives outside of the public aye and to not feel as though people
know things about us which we do not want them to know, particularly issues that we are dealing with here today that touch on the
First Amendment.
What we have here are First Amendment protected materials, library records, video records and that goes to the heart of a First
Amendment issue, about what we read, what movies we watch,
how we think, what our preferences are, and I think that what
Senator Leahy expressed is a common feeling among most citizens,
which is that when you get a piece of mail, which is clearly targeted to you and targeted to your preferences, targeted to your likes
and dislikes, you wonder, "who knows this about me?"
"Where did this information come from? Where is this list, who
else has it?" When you don't know, it can be very disconcerting. So
it is not really the receipt of the mail which is of such concern, but
it is who knows this information about me. How can they target
me so carefully? Even people in my office have raised these questions.
Someone came into my office a couple weeks ago and said, "How
did the Association of Retired Persons know that I am about to
turn 55? How did they know to send me this mailing and say it is
time for me to join?"
Another person said, "How did they know my son made the
dean's list and maybe I want to get him a credit card?"
Mr. BERMAN. And this gets to a privacy concern, as far as the
ACLU is concerned.
Ms. GOLDMAN. Absolutely. It is not just the Bork incident, not
just the unauthorized disclosure to the public of this information. It
is the disclosure within the private sector from company to company, which is very disconcerting, and which raises the possibility
that there could be that unauthorized disclosure.
Mr. Barton says that there has been no demonstrated abuse in
history and that might be true and that is wonderful. So why
shouldn't they, along with Erol's and the Video Dealers Association
and library community support a strong piece of legislation, if it
comports with what they are doing now?
If it buttresses the industry practice, that is absolutely wonderful. That is the strongest reason to join in supporting this.
Mr. BERMAN. That does raise a question which I was going to ask
Mr. Barton in a moment. You say ACLU supports both bills allow-

121
ing disclosure of the name and address of the patron, where such
disclosure does not directly or indirectly reveal the title or content
of the service used, and the individual has been given an opportunity to prohibit the disclosure. As I understand it, now, there is no
general law that gives an individual a right to prohibit disclosure.
Ms. GOLDMAN. That is right.
Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Barton attaches to his testimony, examples of
what he presumably thinks are sincere efforts by his members to
inform people of their right to have their name•not of perhaps the
privilege that
Mr. BARTON. I would rather say privilege, but I understand what
you are talking about.
Mr. BERMAN. Shifting for a second, why wouldn't you support as
a general rule a law that says that before a mailing list can be exchanged or rented, that the people on that list have the right to
have their name removed?
Mr. BARTON. I don't know at this point whether or not we would
support it. We may support it. We may not support it. We would
have to look at the language and work it out.
Our general feeling is that our self-regulation has worked. It
works well, and that you always run into a danger when you start
putting this like that in legislation, you go way beyond what your
original intent is.
A practice in the industry right now is to inform people of their
right to get off lists and to provide them that opportunity. But
there are many, many ways you can do that and I would have to
look at the language of a bill like that carefully. The point I
wanted to make is this bill does not comport with the way we do
this now.
It puts many more restrictions on and it does it with no evidence
at all of any violations of privacy.
Mr. BERMAN. I understand that. When you say we believe that
any person renting or exchanging a mailing list should be able to
describe the character or nature of the video rented, would you
want the opportunity to purchase the mailing list of Erol's club
members, a simple list of members, names and addresses?
Mr. BARTON. Yes.
Mr. BERMAN. Erol, what is your policy with respect to people
who want to do that?
Mr. STEVENSON. We have never sold a mailing list at the present
time.
Mr. BERMAN. Have you leased it or let other people look at it?
Mr. STEVENSON. NO.
Mr. BERMAN. What if a VCR manufacturer says I would like to
know people in the Washington area who have tapes. We have a
new advanced style that allows the unauthorized copying•no. We
would like to see these.
Mr. STEVENSON. At this point they can't. There has been some
discussion within the company to consider selling the general mailing list itself of just members' names and addresses, but at this
point we haven't. We don't, at•we haven't sold any lists at this
point.
Mr. BERMAN. What if you just want the list of all people who
have taken out "Desperately Seeking Susan," because one of the

122
client members wants to peddle Madonna posters, and they are interested in that? I am wondering, Mr. Barton, if you think you
should have a right to get a list of people who rented that movie.
Mr. BARTON. Let me state this in both philosophical terms and
practical terms. In philosophical terms, yes, because we really believe that getting that list doesn't reveal anything about anybody,
because nobody looks at that list. It is a specific letter to a specific
person.
From practical terms we recognize the concerns of that and we
would not oppose a restriction on that.
Mr. BERMAN. A restriction on a specific title?
Mr. BARTON. Yes.
Mr. BERMAN. YOU would oppose a restriction on anything which
described the character or nature of the video rented. I guess I see
the problem here as you can find a lot by asking a superficially
general but in reality very narrow kind of question or seeking a
very limited kind of thing. What if it is to purchase a list of people
who are members not of Erol's, but of the Sex Video Club around
the corner that has the barricaded, walled off sections for adult
videos.
Mr. BARTON. Well, if I could go•if I could say, yes, but also say I
would say the same
Mr. BERMAN. Yes, to what?
Mr. BARTON. That we are not supporting pornography here.
Mr. BERMAN. God forbid, none of us are.
Mr. BARTON. I believe you should be able to rent the list. I will
explain why I use the word "rent" in a moment because almost
nobody gives up their lists. That you should be able to rent names
of people who are interested by virtue of their buying habits and
patterns in specific types of products or general types of products.
This does not violate anybody's privacy.
I think that people, for example, who sell sporting goods, sporting goods might be very interested in, and it violates nobody's privacy, renting "Sporting Life" or "Sports Illustrated" lists. I don't
know whether those companies rent their lists, but I don't see an
invasion of privacy there. I don't see Congressman Berman being
able to take their list and going in and finding out that Richard
Barton is a reader of "Sports Illustrated," and interested in sports.
The only physical manifestation of that piece of information is
the mailing list label that goes to you as an individual. That is•it
is very difficult to go in, almost impossible to go in and get a specific piece of information off of a mailing list, which is a big computer
tape, about a specific person.
If we want to prohibit that, I say we don't do it now, but I think
we can talk about that.
Mr. BERMAN. I have far exceeded my time. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from Ohio, Mr. DeWine.
Mr. DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me give you a hypothetical and see if you have a reaction to it.
Let's say you have a child custody case, or visitation case. The
custodial parent alleges that the noncustodial parent, who has the
10-year-old child as a ritual, goes with the child, picks up an X-

123
rated movie, pornography, goes back home and they consistently,
every Friday night watch these movies.
The custodial parent further alleges that as a result of that,
when the child comes back on Saturday or on Sunday, the child is
upset. The child has nightmares, and that it is affecting the child.
The matter is in dispute between the two parents. The judge, who
is deciding the case, and is listening to a lot of different evidence, a
lot of different testimony, decides that it is a relevant question.
He or she would like to know that fact. Am I correct that under
this bill a judge in the State of Ohio or the State of Kentucky or
California, could not issue an order to obtain those records?
Ms. KRUG. If it were library records, that is exactly what we
would need•a judicial order.
Mr. DEWINE. Under this bill?
Ms. KRUG. Under these bills, both of them.
Mr. DEWINE. Where in the bill can that be done?
Ms. GOLDMAN. The House bill does not provide for the release of
the information in a civil proceeding. The Senate bill does.
Mr. DEWINE. I am looking at the House bill, and it is my understanding that under it this could not be done, even if there has
been a showing to an impartial judge that this is a relevant piece
of information.
My reading of the House bill is that the only exception, and I
will get into this in a minute, has to do with a criminal proceeding.
Ms. GOLDMAN. I think the distinction here is that where you
have First Amendment protected information, you need a very
high standard of protection such as we have here in the House bill,
and that that information can be obtained by other means besides
the release of information.
Mr. DEWINE. It would be your position then that my right of privacy that I checked out an X-rated movie is higher than the good
of that particular child.
Ms. GOLDMAN. Not necessarily.
I think we support the House bill
Mr. DEWINE. Not necessarily. That is an interesting answer.
Ms. GOLDMAN [continuing]. We support the House bill because it
provides for a stronger position. But we also do support the Senate
bill. That is something that we are open to talk about.
Mr. DEWINE. DO you think that is a problem, that there is no
general exception in here that would allow a State court, and I
have just given one example and there could be many, many reasons, to issue an order covering such information.
I mean there is no exception other than this criteria that appears on page 4. The court has to find by clear and convincing evidence that the user has engaged in criminal activity.
Ms. GOLDMAN. We do not have any problem with that. We do
support the provision in the Senate bill.
Mr. DEWINE. Let me carry this another step further and just say
that I also have a problem with the criminal aspect of this, and I
think law enforcement will and I will be anxious to hear what they
have to say about it.
But my understanding of the way the House bill is written today
is that a grand jury conducting a legitimate investigation could not
get any of the records that we are talking about, unless by clear

90-845 0-89-5

124
and convincing evidence they can show that the user had been engaged in criminal activity.
In other words, it has to actually focus on the user and they
must show by clear and convincing evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, but clear and convincing, that criminal activity has been
conducted. I can envision cases where this type of information
would be very useful to clear some people, for example, or very
useful in a general investigation, when the person who checked out
the book or the person who checked out the video was not the
target of the investigation at all, and so I think that, Mr. Chairman, it is a certainly a well-intentioned bill.
I was as horrified as everyone else was, I think, by the Bork example. I think it creates a real problem. I think we can craft a bill
that will protect in that type of circumstance, but I think the language here today frankly has some real, real problems.
Mr. BERMAN. Would the gentleman yield on that point?
Mr. DEWINE. I would be more than happy to yield.
Mr. BERMAN. Also in the House bill, as it is restricted to criminal
proceedings, it all turns on the question of the prosecutorial interest in obtaining this information.
What about, to the extent it is relevant, and for purposes of a
fair trial, the defendant's right to make his case or impeach earlier
testimony? Should there be something?
Mr. DEWINE. That is an excellent point and I think the problem
with the House language is that we are talking about the user.
We are focusing only on one individual and it could be that that
type of information could be used as a defense, that there could be
a third party involved, and you want to get that information in
with the third party.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chairman.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The Senator from Vermont.
Mr. LEAHY. If I can interject for a moment, they just called for
another vote. I think there are going to be a series of them, so I
will probably have to leave at this point, but, I spent 8V2 years as a
prosecutor and tried hundreds of felony cases and other cases personally.
I argued more cases over that period of time in the Vermont Supreme Court as well as the Federal Courts and Courts of Appeals.
Also, incidentally, and this may sound terribly self-serving, but I
had the highest conviction rate that any prosecutor ever had in
this century, literally.
Actually, I argued more cases on appeal than all my predecessors
for 180 years put together in that office. I never lost on one of
those.
I can't think of a single instance where being able to subpoena
records where somebody had checked out books•which would be
mostly what would have been then•or tapes, could have any relevance in a trial that I might have had.
I had a variety of trials from bank robbery to murders, to environmental matters to embezzlement, to fraud, to blackmail. I can't
think of a single instance where having these kind of lists would,
one, help the investigation, and two, even if we had gotten them,
would have been eligible for proof under any basis whatsoever.

125
Now, the Senate bill does have exceptions for civil discovery if
there is some area where you have some kind of probative value,
but I would suspect if I owned Erol's or owned any other video
store, I wouldn't want to give up something like this unless there
was a very specific court order where there had been the offer of
proof and the usual steps that you have to take to get it.
I would want to be darn sure I had a court order in hand before I
gave anything up just for my own protection. I suspect you would
give that same advice to any store owner who called you. But I
just, I suppose there may be something that I have overlooked
somewhere in that experience that would say we should do it. I
can't think of anything that would have proven anything.
Anyway, I pass that on for what it is worth. We do have civil
discovery in the Senate bill.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from Ohio.
Mr. DEWINE. If I can reclaim my time, I think the problem, Mr.
Chairman, is that the House Bill doesn't allow for that court order,
there is no provision in there.
Like the Senator who spent many years in prosecution, I was involved in prosecution for 6Vz years. The one thing.I learned is that
every case is different. You never know what the facts are going to
be and they change all the time. Having come out of that system, I
am very comfortable with allowing a judge to make the determination of whether or not there is reasonable grounds to issue a subpoena or whether or not there is a reason to get this basic information.
The problem with the House bill, Senator, is that it simply does
not allow that to be done. It doesn't allow a judge to make that determination at all. Only under very, very, very narrow circumstances. So, I think it is a question of flexibility and we need to
take care of that problem.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. The Senator has had to leave to vote. I have
one or two questions. The gentleman from Ohio points out that in
fact there are differences between the House and Senate bills,
slight differences, this being one, I think the gentleman from Ohio
called attention to.
I would like to talk just a little bit about industry practices. Mr.
Stevenson, obviously, the Bork case did not involve an Erol's Video
Store because that would have been against your policy:
Mr. STEVENSON. Yes.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. And even though you speak for some 20,000
out of 30,000 potential stores, not only Erol's but other stores, there
are not uniform industry practices in terms of these particular privacy concerns, I take it.
Mr. STEVENSON. Well, I think that in terms of uniform industry
practice really goes to retention of records. I mean, you have the
majority of the video stores are small, one-owner operations, and
there is everything from personal computers that hold records up
to Erol's which has a main frame computer to the person that has,
you know, a card file of members. And so in terms of the way
records are kept and the way that people market to their members
or check out tapes are all different, but I would say generally
speaking because it is a rental business, there is a record of that
customer and what he checked in or out, whether it is on computer

126
or whether it is within that computer or on a card, because there
has got to be some way to get that tape back if it doesn't come
back.
In terms of protecting the privacy of those records, based on
what I know about the VSDA members and our own practices, information is not being released. Mailing lists, I am sure, are being
sold of general memberships of video clubs and that kind of thing,
but beyond that, I am not aware of any.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. DO you support passage of these bills before
us?
Mr. STEVENSON. Yes.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Having a uniform practice set down by statute would be preferable for the industry as a whole, you believe; is
that not correct?
Mr. STEVENSON. Yes.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. AS far as the libraries are concerned, since
the library standards are really very protective, as you have recited, why is a bill on this subject necessary, Ms. Krug?
Ms. KRUG. For the very reason that the examples in my written
testimony and the few that I tried to provide exhibit. We are often
asked to provide records, particularly circulation records, which
identify what people are reading, what they are borrowing from libraries, for use in ways that we consider to be inappropriate and
definitely are not the reason or the purpose for which those records
are kept.
We also recommend that, because we view circulation records as
housekeeping records, once the materials are returned to the libraries, that the personal identifiable information is expunged
from the record. Many libraries are moving in this direction, so
you don't have records that go back hundreds of years or even 5 or
6 years.
In other words, once the material is returned, we have it back
and, therefore, the record of who took it out can be expunged. But
it is very serious to have someone impute a motive to you because
of what you read. There are people who believe, number 1, if you
don't have anything to hide, then it is OK to make it public, which
I consider to be violative of the essence of humanness.
Second, if you read in specific areas, such as gay literature, you
automatically are homosexual. If you read about witchcraft and the
occult, you are automatically involved in that arena. If you read
materials about any subject, perhaps beyond the mainstream, you
automatically acquire those characteristics. These kinds of charges
can be very damaging to individuals, both personally and professionally.
It is one of the reasons that we think again it is nobody's business what you read, but your own. The gentleman from Ohio, Mr.
DeWine, pointed out some other instances where he felt that the
circulation records or these kinds of records may be appropriate.
The truth is, Mr. Chairman, we don't ask people to take a litmus
test or even a test of what they read when they bring the books
back. We don't ask them what uses are going to be made of these
materials. When I was in high school, for instance, I used to take
books out of the library so my boyfriend would have something to
carry home. I didn't want him to go home empty-handed. I know,

127
library materials are used for lots of reasons, that being one end of
the spectrum. Therefore, we believe the use for which they are
going to use these materials is a private activity and should be
treated as such.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. I would assume that it would make a lot more
sense, rather than the libraries relying necessarily on association
self-imposed standards with respect to privacy concerns, or indeed
the differing State statutes in the 38 States and the District of Columbia, if there were a uniform statute on the question, that would
be more helpful for libraries. Otherwise, they would have to conform to, in some cases, no laws at all, but rather to association,
let's say regulations or practices, which may be perhaps more difficult to assert or would not have to be asserted if, in fact, there was
an understanding of what a Federal law on the subject would provide with respect to this question.
Would you not agree with that?
Ms. KRUG. We believe it would bring uniformity. It would cover
the States that do not have such statutes. We believe it would be
much easier to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of specific
records if indeed there were a Federal statute.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Barton, you mentioned that you had negotiated successfully with respect to the Cable Deregulation Act, in
terms of practices or access on the part of Direct Marketing Association, and cable operators, but doesn't the Act, as I understand it,
prohibit cable operators from disclosing, indirectly or directly, programs or other services that the subscriber might sign for?
Isn't that really a more difficult, a stricter standard than that
which the bill would call for?
Mr. BARTON. We didn't think so at the time.
Our counsel back here, Ron Plesser, who worked on here, may be
able to answer the question more authoritatively.
It does restrict our ability to rent cable lists more than I think
we believe necessary at this time and more than we think necessary in the context of this bill. But the original proposal there was
to prevent us from renting them at all.
At that time, we didn't really have a clear idea of what kind of
information would be available and there was no question about
the fact that when you went broadly into what the cable can do,
particularly when it gets interactive and there are all sorts of personal transactions you can go on or that go on that you wouldn't
want to know about.
Now, you are right, we can rent•the customer list of a cable
company which right now is specific enough for us, but I don't believe we can rent if we break it down into HBO customers or whatever the specific channels are; isn't that correct?
Mr. PLESSER. I think that basic level of service can be segmented,
but it is also important to note that there are no special cable operators. Cable operators sell to geographic areas.
They are not selling for example, camping equipment, so that
you can, by the mere fact of getting a list, identify the character of
the video.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. May I indicate to the stenographer that that
is Ron Plesser who responded to that question. Is there a distinction to be made between video mail sales or rentals versus retail

128
video store rentals or sales, with respect to access for marketing for
sale or rental of lists? Is there a distinction to be made?
Mr. BARTON. Yes and no. We would like, I think, as an industry,
that no distinction be made but I think we recognize that what
happened with Judge Bork and perhaps with other people is such a
difficulty that we would back off on that. We would say that it
would still be useful for us if we can go to Erol's and say, instead of
renting your general customer list, we would like to know who is
interested in sports and who is interested in this and that, but we
recognize that the nature and form of the information Erol's has is
easier to extract•we would not fight not being able to do that.
One step further is that the specific information that Erol's has
which the people want is much more specific than we usually want
to get in a rental list. Therefore, I think a valid distinction can be
made in the law to limit this to the retail rental establishments. I
think there is enough of a distinction and enough of a question of
the immediacy of the information that is available and literally
that can be gotten when you walk into a store and any clerk can
punch it up, or at least in a sophisticated store, any clerk can
punch it up on a screen, and I think from my personal viewpoint,
and I believe from the association's, that is a legitimate distinction
to allow to distinguish between retail and mail order.
Mr. STEVENSON. One real quick thing I wanted to point out about
our system. It would be virtually impossible to generate a list today
of people that were interested in golfing tapes, for example, or any
particular rental category, because we don t store the information
that way. We don't segment it that way.
If I can take a minute, I will run through it. If you go into an
Erol's store and check out tapes, that information remains in the
computer until you bring them back at the store level. Once those
tapes have been checked back in, that information is transmitted
to our central computer facility in Springfield, held for 14 days, put
on a disk and shipped out to a vault someplace.
I don't even know where it is, and stored. But to reconstruct, say,
a customer that has been with us 2, 3, 4 years would almost be impossible. The only reason the information has been retained is because Erol Onaran, who owns the company, at one time thought in
the future we might be able to market directly to individuals at the
store level, where if somebody checked out a certain number of
times, you might suggest movies they haven't rented before at the
point of transaction.
That is the only reason. We haven't kept them for any other
reason, nor do we segment.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Erol's is not, I take it, and I ask only for my
own information, involved in a mail order business in addition to
your retail outlets?
Mr. STEVENSON. We get involved in mail order from time to time
through our magazine that we publish once a month, but as a practical matter, no.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Does the prohibition against a video service
provider retaining its records for more than one year, is that or
would that be a problem for Erol's or any other dealer?
Mr. STEVENSON. In terms of being able to retain
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Yes.

129
Mr. STEVENSON. TO comply. No, I don't think the way the bill is
written, no.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you.
Are there further questions of my colleagues? The gentleman
from California.
Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am still confused by
the direct marketer's notion of what they support and what they
couldn't support. You say in the context of video, this legislation
should be limited to retail rental establishments, leaving at least
the implication that you would support legislation that was limited.
What is the logical distinction between a retail video establishment and a mail order video establishment?
Mr. BARTON. One of them is, as I mentioned, the immediacy of
the information that is available, and the ease for it to be given
out.
Number two
Mr. BERMAN. I don't understand that.
Mr. BARTON. Well, you can walk into a video store and a clerk
can give you the information you are asking for. You can't do that
out of a mailing list. It is just•it doesn't exist in that form.
You could walk into the business office of a specific company and
demand to see their transaction records, but that is the only way
that you can get the kind of information that we are talking about,
and that has never been done. People don't do that.
Mr. BERMAN. YOU are saying the reason for the distinction is
that public disclosure is less likely to come from a mail order operation that we are getting our lists from than from a retail establishment that we are getting the list from.
Mr. BARTON. Public disclosure of the information we are talking
about, yes, much less. It doesn't come from getting a name off of a
mailing list. In the first place, it is physically almost impossible to
do that. We are talking with just mailing lists, not the business
records of our companies or anything like that which are similar to
Erol's.
We haven't had a problem with that. The second reason and let's
be frank, the retail industry is asking for it, and we are not going
to get into a fight with the videotape rental industry. If they want
to restrict it on that level, that is fine. If they want to be protected
against being inadvertently or directly giving information, being
sued, I think that is fine with us.
We in the mailing industry don't have that problem.
Ms. GOLDMAN. If I can add to that, I think one of the confusions
here is that this legislation is not targeted at any particular industry. It is designed to protect certain kinds of information, regardless of whatever industry puts it out. I think that is a very important point that needs to be made here, because it is not as though
the legislation is going after a particular industry.
Mr. BERMAN. It looks to me like just the opposite. This is legislation targeted at particular industries, rather than the kind of information. The books I might get from a book-of-the-month club would
not be covered by this legislation, but books I get from the library
will be covered.

130
The records, a lot of information that would seem to me to be of
the kind of character that is covered in video stores will not be covered, because they aren't disseminated by those industries.
Ms. GOLDMAN. The other point made earlier is that Erol's, for instance, says it doesn't program its computer to call up information
by subject matter. That is because they are not in the mailing list
business, and it is not necessary to do that, but it is very easy to do
that.
Because their computers are not programmed that way at this
time, nothing at this point precludes them from doing that and
from disclosing the information to the public.
Mr. BARTON. Mailing lists is not information disclosed to the
public. We can pursue that.
Mr. STEVENSON. AS a practical matter, it would be an inappropriate business practice. I mean, if we were to do that with a number
of stores, for example, that we have in the Washington area, we
would be out of business, I am sure.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Barton, do you know of any other industry that might have concerns about these bills, other than your association?
Mr. BARTON. Not directly, but I could be wrong about that. I
haven't really thought about that. I think you are dealing with the
concerned industries right here, the four of us.
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Yes. The reason I ask is obviously the direct
marketing associations do have concerns. We have had some concerns expressed about whether there ought to be court orders in
civil actions available, and indeed, whether law enforcement might
have some interest or concerns with respect to the bill.
But other than those concerns, I think there is a consensus that
this legislation could be a step forward in addressing what is perceived as a problem.
And it is a good question raised by the gentleman from California as to whether it ought to be broadened or not. I guess we have
tried to respond to what is perceived recently, in recent times, as a
couple of potentially troublesome areas with respect to invasion of
privacy, libraries and the video business. Some of the other industries or commercial applications, other types of book clubs and so
forth, if•I guess, if there is not a perceived need, we have not attempted to broaden the legislation to include those areas.
That is why I think it is as it is today, as it appears before us. In
any event, on behalf of the committee, I want to thank the four
witnesses for their contribution this morning. We appreciate it
very much.
The committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the subcommittee adjourned, to reconvene subject to the call of the Chair.]

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS

STATEMENT OF SENATOR PAUL SIMON BEFORE A JOINT HEARING
OF THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON TECHNOLOGY AND THE LAW
AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COURTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES
AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
ON THE VIDEO AND LIBRARY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 1988
AUGUST 3, 1988

I am pleased to join with my colleagues in holding this
joint hearing on legislation to protect one of the most
treasured liberties of all, the right to privacy. There is no
denying that the computer age has revolutionized our world.
Over the past twenty years we have seen remarkable changes in
the way each one of us goes about our lives. Our children
learn through computers.
We bank by machine. We watch movies
in our living rooms. These technological innovations are
exciting and as a nation we should be proud of the
accomplishments we have made.
Yet as we continue to move ahead, we must protect time
honored values that are so central to this society,
particularly our right to privacy. The advent of the computer
means not only that we can be more efficient than ever before,
but that we have the ability to be more intrusive than ever
before.
Every day Americans are forced to provide tobusinesses and others personal information without having any
control over where that information goes.
Computer records are
kept on where we travel, what we eat, what we buy, what we
watch and what we read. These records are a window into our
loves, likes and dislikes. As Justice Brandeis predicted over
10 years ago in his famous dissent in the Olmstead wiretap case
time works changes, brings into existence new-conditions
and purposes... Subtler and more far reaching means of
invading privacy have become available...Ways may some day
be developed by which the Government, without removing
papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court
and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the
most intimate occurences of the home.
This point was brought home to me during the course of the
confirmation hearings on Judge Bork when I learned that a
reporter had received
from a local video store a list of the
movies that Judge Bork and his family had rented.
Who would
guess that the choice of movies one watches in the privacy of
the home would not be confidential?
The Video and Library Privacy Act of 1988 takes an
important step in ensuring that individuals will maintain
control over their personal information when renting or
(131)

132
purchasing a movie or when borrowing a library book. The bill
specifically provides for a federal cause of action in the
event a list which identifies the books we read or the movies
we watch is released. Since there are certain circumstances
in which it may be necessary for this information to be
divulged, the bill provides for some limited exceptions to the
prohibition, including an exemption to cover legitimate law
enforcement activities.
No doubt in the days and years ahead we will continue to
make much progress in developing new technologies. While I am
fully supportive of innovation and growth, I remain committed
to protecting those principles which are so central to America.
The legislation which is the subject of the hearing today
strikes the necessary balance to ensure that our privacy will
not be lost as we move ahead.
I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses and hope
that we can move ahead on this legislation this year.

STATEMENT OF SENATOR ALAN K. SIMPSON
JOINT HEARING ON S. 2361
AUGUST 3, 1988
RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING 2237

First let me say that It Is a real pleasure to be here this
morning and to Join the Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the Law
and the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the
Administration of Justice.

I thank Senator Leahy and Congressman

Kastenmeier for allowing me the privilege of Joining them here in order
to receive the testimony of the witnesses in today's hearing.

The idea of legislation to protect the privacy rights on an
Individual's video club records or library records first arose during
the hearings on the Bork nomination.

It was then that I learned that a

local reporter had decided to publish In a newspaper known as the "City
Paper" the video rental record of Judge Bork • as though that would be
some great and dazzling story or delightfully entertaining piece or
"investigative Journalism" at its worse

• or simply "Creative

Reporting About People," with the acronym of CRAP!

The fact was, and still is, is that it is nobody's business what
videos are rented by Judge Bork or anyone else.

It does not matter

whether you are a nominee for the Supreme Court or the City Council or
the School Board.

As Judge Bork so articulately pointed out during his

hearings, the Congress of the United States does have the power to
legislate privacy rights if it wishes.

Thus we are about that business

134
now and I think it la certainly appropriate for both video records and
library records.

It la that cherished American right of privacy that we are
protecting with this legislation.

People in this country may not even

be able to read or understand the Constitution, but they surely can
understand the concept of privacy In their personal lives.
unmitigated unvarnished privacy.

Plain old

The right to be left alone.

That is

why such diverse groups are working on this bill in order to obtain its
passage.

I do not mean to Imply that the bill as currently drafted is
perfect.

Otherwise there would not be much reason for these hearings.

I do think we can perhaps review some provisions in the bill and offer
suggestions in how to increase its effectiveness without impinging on
appropriate release and disclosure of personal records to law
enforcement officials or under court order as appropriate.

I think we need to be especially careful that we do not overly
restrict the access of such information to legitimate police inquiry
where it Is necessary to further investigations into criminal
activities which may even affect national security through espionage.
It may seem absurd to state that a person's video records or library
records could somehow be connected with foreign counterintelligence and
espionage.

But it is quite apparent that Just such foreign operatives

are actively engaged in the use of our vast, easily accessible library
system in order to recruit intelligence sources and to uncover
Information which perhaps should not be so readily accessible.

135
I look forward to working with the Senate and House Subcommittees
and the Senate full Committee on the Judiciary on this important
issue.

As an original cosponsor of the Senate bill, I think it is most

important that we pursue markup on the bill.

I also want to thank

members of these Subcommittees for the active involvement which they
have taken in seeing this legislation through the process and the
remarkable and consistent work of Congressman Al McCandless in the
House to introduce the bill and work towards its passage.

Thank you.

Dear Representative Kastenmeler and Senator Leahy:
On behalf of the American Library Association, I want to thank
you for holding the joint hearing August 3 on H.R. 4947/S. 2361.
This bill Is a major step forward in protecting the privacy
rights of Americans.
If enacted, this bill would establish a
uniform federal standard which would protect the privacy of
library users.
This standard would be a complement to that
which 36 states have already adopted and would be controlling In
states where no similar law exists.
The difference between the House and Senate versions on the
detail of whether a court ordered disclosure could occur in civil
as well as In criminal matters received much discussion.
Our
view would be that the most Important concept here is that of a
court order as the required vehicle for disclosure. We recognize
and agree with the view expressed by Senator Leahy limiting the
grounds for such an order to a criminal proceeding.
Since the hearing, my colleagues and I have continued to work
with staff on language and to respond to their questions.
We
are grateful for your support and interest in this matter.

The Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier
2328 Rayburn House Office Building
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D. C. 20515
Dear Hr. Kastenmeier:
On behalf of the American Library Association, I an writing to
express our strong support for the Video and Library Privacy Protection
Act of 1988, HR 4947, legislation that would create a federal right to
privacy in personally identifiable library use records and video rental
or sale records.
Thirty-eight states, plus the District of Columbia, have passed
laws protecting the confidentiality of library use records. In addition, since 1970, the ALA and its more than 45,000 member librarians,
library trustees, and libraries have had a policy: a) that library
circulation records are confidential in nature; and b) that such records
should not be made available to any other party except pursuant to a
court order issued by a judicial authority.
The ALA opposes any amendment to the proposed legislation which
would create a "national security letter" disclosure process.
Particularly in view of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's repeated
testimony before House and Senate committees that the Bureau is not
interested in library records, and has never requested or received
library records, we fail to see any justification for creating a special
disclosure process to provide access to library records for the FBI or
other law enforcement agencies.
Further, the adoption of any amendment to HR 4947 to create a
"national security letter" disclosure process may authorize a part of
the FBI Library Awareness Program, or similar activities. Both the
House and Senate recently have held hearings on these activities.
Creating a "national security letter" disclosure process at this time
appears to ALA to grant tacit approval to the Bureau program(s). ALA
believes that taxing action which appears to endorse the very activities
now under congressional scrutiny naturally undermines the integrity of
the investigations, and may defeat their purpose outright.
A court order, obtained upon good cause shown to the appropriate
judicial authority, is the proper vehicle for obtaining library records.

141
Mr. Kastenmeier
September 23, 1988
Page Two

We believe the court order standard in HR 4947 is the only justifiable
standard to require production of such records, and it will not impede
legitimate law enforcement interests. Furthermore, this process
protects librarians with a uniform standard to be applied when
librarians are faced with one of the most crucial dilemmas of their
profession, a choice between maintaining their professional ethics, or
acceding to requests by law enforcement authorities.
Again, we strongly support the single court order standard now in
the bill, and we urge the Committee on the Judiciary to defeat any
amendment relating to a "national security letter" disclosure process.
Thank you for your consideration.

The Honorable Peter W. Rod1no, Jr.

20515
Dear Mr. Chairman:
On behalf of the Special Libraries Association, I want to express our
support for the confidentiality of library records maintained by public
institutions.
In this regard, we are pleased that the House Judiciary
Committee will be considering legislation which embodies this principle, H.R. 4947, the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act of 1988.
As the bill now stands, library records could only be obtained with
the approval of the individual involved or by a court order. We are
chagrined to learn that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is
attempting to get a "national security letter" exemption. This would
enable the FBI to get confidential library records without judicial
review or notification of the subject in question.
In our opinion, this circumvents the intent of the legislation and
enables the FBI to obtain library records without showing cause. The
Association opposes the activities of the FBI's Library Awareness
Program and views this national security exemption as a way for this
agency to continue its program, with, in essence. Congressional
approval.
Interestingly, the FBI has stated in Congressional hearings that it is
not interested in obtaining library records. We would question, therefore, why the agency deems it necessary to seek an exemption in this
legislation.
We urge you, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, to oppose
any national security exemption for any federal agency including the
FBI during consideration of the Video and Library Privacy Protection
Act of 1988.

The Honorable Robert Kastenaeier
Chairman
Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties,
and the Administration of Justice
2137 Kayburn
Washington, D.C. 20515
Dear Chairman Kastenaeier,
On behalf of the 270,000 members of the People For the
American Nay Action Fund, a nonpartisan constitutional liberties
organization, I urge your support for H.R. 4947, the Video and
Library Privacy Act. The Courts, Civil Liberties and the
Administration of Justice Subcommittee is scheduled to mark up
H.R. 4947 on Tuesday, October 4, 1988. The bill is an essential
safeguard against the wrongful disclosure of information relating
to an individual's use of libraries, and the use of services
involving video rental or sale. America is in the midst of an
information revolution in which a balance must be struck between
the increased ability to acquire information, and the need to
protect personal privacy.
Evidence of the need for the bill is apparent in several
actions brought to the attention of the public:
•

In 1988, it was revealed that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, as part of its controversial "Library
Awareness Program," has attempted to obtain library
circulation records as part of a counter-intelligence
effort. The FBI's program has frequently been conducted
without regard to the library confidentiality laws of some
of the 38 states around the country which have such laws.
Such activities threaten constitutional rights to privacy,
and ironically, suspend democratic freedoms in the name of
protecting democracy.

•

In 1987, a Washington, D.C, newspaper published the
videotape rental record of the family of Supreme Court
nominee Judge Bork. According to press accounts, the
profile of the Bork family's viewing habits was leaked to a
reporter by ma•one with access to the computer videotape
rental files. We believe that the release of such
information is a clear violation of the right to privacy.
Citizens who rent videos to view in the privacy of their own
hoaes do so with the expectation that their choices are a
private matter.

144
H.R. 4947 creates important enforcement mechanisms to
protect against wrongful disclosure of video records: (1) civil
penalties for infractions (2) requirement of written consent from
consumer for disclosure of personal identifiable information at
time the disclosure is sought. Currently such information about
individuals is released unless it is expressly prohibited.
People For the American Nay Action Fund strongly supports the new
enforcement and consent provisions.
Americans must be assured that their, choices of library
materials and video transactions are kept private. H.R. 4947
creates such clear and uniform protections in federal law.
People For the American Hay Action Fund urges Congress and the
President to support the "Video and Library Protection Act," and
to oppose all weakening* amendments.

Dear Congressman Kastenmeier:
This letter is to convey the support of the Association of Research Libraries for
the Video and Libraly Privacy Protection Act of 1988, HR 4947. The provisions of the
bill are in harmony with the policies of research libraries and such a federal law will
strengthen protection for the confidentiality of library records by prohibiting their
disclosure except with the person's consent or under court order.
In a related matter, ARL follows the investigation of the FBI Library Awareness
Program by the Civil and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee. ARL has formally
opposed the Library Awareness Program and we have asked FBI Director Sessions to
publicly disavow the program. We await with considerable interest the next steps in the
Subcommittee investigation.
We now understand there may be a national security letter exemption in the Video
and Library Privacy Protection Act that allows the FBI to gain access to records
without court order pursuant to foreign counterintelligence activity. We strongly
oppose this provision. We also do not understand the rationale for considering it as part
of HR 4947.
It is ARL's position that library records deserve to be protected by a higher
standard than this exemption provides. Library records represent First Amendment
activities - to receive and exchange information - and should be revealed only after a
judicial review determines it is necessary. In addition, the FBI has said publicly that
they are not interested in, nor do they seek to see library records. So what is the need
for exempting the Bureau from the Video and Library Privacy Protection Act?
A mandatory or permissive national security letter exemption in HR 4947 would in
part authorize, or be perceived by library users as authorization, for the Library
Awareness Program and other similar activities. Adoption of this exemption would also
put an end to the Congressional investigation of the Library Awareness Program. Given
the negative publicity and questions that remain unanswered by the FBI about the
Library Awareness Program, these are not desirable consequences.
ARL urges that the House address the two issues separately by passing the Video
and Library Records Protection Act this session but without a national security letter
exemption. This action would strengthen protection for the confidentiality of video and
library records and allow the ongoing Congressional investigation in the Library
Awareness Program to continue.
Sincerely

Daar Mr. Chairman:
wa arm writing to you about H.R. 4947, tha vldao and Library
Privacy Protection Act of 1988, which prohibit* tha unauthorized
dlaclosura of vidao and library racorda.
Tha bill haa broad,
bipartisan support.
It waa introduced in response to tha
disclosure of Judge Robert Bork's vidao atora racorda during hia
Supreme Court nomination hearings, and was expanded to include
libraries, where tha potential for aimilar abuses ia great.
He understand that rapraaantativaa of tha Federal Bureau of
Invaatigation have spoken with certain Members about possible
amendments to the bill.
Wa are greatly concerned that these
amendments not be permitted to impede the progress of the bill,
which is presently being marked up by the Subcommittee on Courts,
Civil Liberties and tha Administration of Justice. He expect the
bill to be favorably reported by the Subcommittee, and to proceed
to full Judiciary Committee consideration next week.
He stress that tha FBI has never formally contacted us about
any problems with H.R. 4947.
Counsel to the Subcommittee sat
with FBI representatives last July 13, and tha Bureau was
informally invited to testify at the Subcommittee's August 3
hearing. A formal invitation letter was issued on July 26, 1988.
The Bureau declined these invitations, both informally to
Subcommittee counsel, and in an August 2, 1988 letter from
Director William Sessions.
On both occasions, however, the
Bureau promised to submit written comments on the bill. He have
never received any such comments.
Our understanding, however, is that tha Bureau has eight
specific problems with H.R. 4947.
Seven of the problems relate
generally to the scope of materials prohibited from disclosure,
and to tha standards by which law enforcement aganciea may seek
court ordered disclosure of video and library records. The
Bureau apparently believes that these standards are too onerous.

147
Page 12
and we are willing to seek appropriate amendments at the full
Committee markup to rectify these seven concerns.
The eighth proposal Is a request that the FBI be permitted
to obtain video and library records without seeking a court
order, through a national security letter.
While we recognize
that such a procedure has been authorized in other laws, relating
to bank and telephone toll records, we strongly believe that this
procedure is inappropriate in this context. First, the aaterials
protected by H.R. 4947 are protected by the First Amendment, and
thus entitled to the strongest possible prohibition against
disclosure.
Second, the FBI has simply not made any case that
the national security letter procedure is warranted here.
In
testimony about the Library Awareness Program before the
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights last July, the
Bureau testified that "I can assure you that the FBI is not now
nor has it ever been interested in the reading habits of American
citizens. . . I have found no situation at all where we got any
records or any information on any U.S. person as far as library
records or personal information goes, any." In either the video
or library context, there has been no evidence to the contrary.
We are more than willing to accommodate the FBI in its
legitimate law enforcement needs.
However, the Bureau does not
need a national security letter exemption and to permit it would
create such a large hole in the bill as to render our efforts
futile.
The insertion of a national security letter exemption
would be seen by the library community as congressional
authorization for the Library Awareness Program, which, as you
know, has generated tremendous concern among librarians. Given
the questions raised by the Bureau's conduct in the CISPES case,
where extensive use was made of the national security letter to
obtain bank and telephone toll records, this is no time to
authorize further use of the technique, particularly for records
with First Amendment implications, such as library and video
records.
We hope that you will not act favorably on any request that
the House Committee on Intelligence seek a sequential referral on
H.R. 4947. Please feel free to contact either of us if you need
sore information about this matter.

SEP 2 7 1988

Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am writing to comment on H.R. 4947 and S. 2361, bills
which would regulate the manner in which law enforcement agencies
obtain records from libraries and video stores.
Of significant concern to the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies is the cumulative effect that this
legislation arid other similar legislative initiatives have on law
enforcement's ability to protect the public safety and ensure the
national security. The notification requirements and the
administrative burden necessary to obtain such information will
deter law enforcement requests for such information. More
importantly, the standards contained in these bills are
tantamount to an absolute prohibition of disclosure of personally
identifiable information to law enforcement agencies for
investigative purposes.
One of the exceptions created by the bills would
provide for the disclosure of information incidental to or
necessary for legitimate business concerns. It is troublesome
that information prohibited for law enforcement purposes could be
readily disclosed for business purposes.
I understand that 38 states have already acted to
provide for confidentiality of library records. Federal
legislation for library confidentiality is an intrusion into
areas traditionally regulated by the States. Regulation of video
record confidentiality by the States is to be expected. If
Congress, however, determines that Federal legislation is
required to protect personally identifiable information hole1, by
video service providers &nd libraries, I offer the following
recommendations that would ensure essential law enforcement

149
Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier
investigative needs can be fulfilled while providing an
independent review to determine if the information is needed for
legitimate law enforcement purposes or required to protect the
national security. Although these recommendations will provide
for basic needs, from a public safety standpoint a general
exemption would be preferred.
S. 2361 contains a definition of personally
identifiable information. I recommend that definition be
included in the House bill. Provisions of each bill address the
disclosure of personally identifiable information to Federal and
state law enforcement agencies. The provisions that notice be
given to the subject of the information about a court proceeding
providing for disclosure are often contrary to law enforcement
Interests in that they acknowledge the existence of an
investigation. Also troublesome is the standard of "clear and
convincing evidence" that the subject of the information is
reasonably suspected (S. 2361) of engaging in or has engaged
(H.R. 4947) in criminal activity and that the information sought
would be highly probative to the case. "Clear and convincing" is
not a term frequently used in criminal matters. It should be
clearly defined, and if it remains in the bills, should be
distinguished from the higher standard of probable cause.
H.R. 4947 would add an additional requirement that law
enforcement must show that other less intrusive investigative
processes have been utilized or would not succeed. Although a
similar provision appears in the Federal wiretapping statute, it
is observed that electronic surveillance is an extraordinary
investigative technique and is usually used to obtain information
directly from suspects, not third parties. It also invades an
area in which there is a high expectation of privacy. H.R. 4947
also requires a showing of why the value of tie information
sought would outweigh competing privacy interests. These
standards would effectively prohibit law enforcement agencies
from obtaining video and library records for investigative
purposes.
To remedy these problems, I recommend that disclosure
to law enforcement agencies be allowed by two authorities: a
court order and a grand jury subpoena. The standards for
issuance of a court order or subpoena would be identical to the
standards for those instruments as required by a court or a grand
jury for issuance. Either could provide for nondisclosure to the
subject of the records.

150
Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier
A third disclosure process by "national security
letter" should be fashioned to parallel the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2709) or the Right to
Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. Sec. 3414(a)) which permit the
disclosure of telephone toll records and financial institution
records when a certification is made that records sought are for
foreign counterintelligence purposes and that there are specific
and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the customer
or entity whose records are sought is a foreign power or an agent
of a foreign power. Without this procedure, the FBI could not
effectively monitor and counter clandestine activities of hostile
espionage agents and terrorists. The standard of "specific and
articulable facts" is lower than the probable cause or "clear and
convincing evidence" standards. It is the standard used for
disclosure of financial and telephone toll records in
counterintelligence investigations. The national security letter
process will, however, limit access, and if coupled with a semiannual reporting procedure, similar to that contained in the
Right to Financial Privacy Act, can be reviewed by appropriate
congressional oversight committees.
As noted above, our estimates show that such disclosure
procedures would have limited use. It is, however, important
that if Federal confidentiality legislation is adopted relating
to video services and library services, that there be procedures
available that will allow legitimate Federal, state and local law
enforcement needs to be served in a reasonable manner, balancing
?ublic safety and the national security with personal privacy
nterests.
In conclusion, these recommendations provide for
minimal law enforcement interests. Although Federal law
enforcement agencies could perhaps work effectively under a new
records disclosure process, I fear the impact of such legislation
will cause serious problems on the quality and effectiveness of
local law enforcement where work is of a more reactive nature and
where the abilities to deal with such procedures are more
limited.
