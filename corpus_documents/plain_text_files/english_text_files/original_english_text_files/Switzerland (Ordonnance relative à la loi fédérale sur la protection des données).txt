The Swiss Federal Council,
based on Articles 6 paragraph 3, 7 paragraph 2, 8, 11a paragraph 6, 16 paragraph 2,
17a and 36 paragraphs 1, 4 and 6 of the Federal Act of 19 June 19921 on

Chapter 1
Section 1

Processing of Personal Data by Private Persons
Right of Access

Art. 1

Modalities

Anyone who requests information from the controller of a data file on whether data
concerning them is being processed (Art. 8 DPA) must normally request the information in writing and provide proof of their identity.
1

Requests for information as well as the provision of information may also be made
online if the controller of the data file expressly arranges for this and takes appropriate measures to:

2

a.

guarantee the identification of the data subject; and

b.

protect the personal data of the data subject when providing information
against unauthorised access by third parties.4

With the agreement of the controller of the data file or at his suggestion, the data
subject may inspect their data in situ. The information may also be provided verbally
if the data subject has consented and has been identified by the controller.

235.11

Data Protection

The information or the substantiated decision on the restriction of the right of
access (Art. 9 and 10 DPA) is provided within 30 days of receipt of the request for
information. If the information cannot be provided within 30 days, the controller of
the data file must notify the applicant of this and of the date by which the information will be provided.

4

5 If one or more data files are jointly held by two or more controllers, the right of
access may be asserted against each controller, unless one of them is responsible for
processing all requests for information. If the controller of the data file is not authorised to provide information, he shall pass the request on to the person responsible.

If the request for information relates to data that is being processed by a third party
on behalf of the controller of the data file, the controller shall pass the request on to
the third party for processing if the controller is not able to provide the information
himself.5

6

If information is requested on data relating to deceased persons, it must be provided if the applicant proves an interest in the information that is not countered by the
overriding interests of relatives of the deceased or third parties. Close relatives and
persons who have been married to the deceased have a justified interest.

7

Art. 2

Exceptions to the exemption from costs

The payment of an appropriate share of the costs may by way of exception be
requested if:

1

a.

the applicant has already been provided with the requested information in
the twelve months prior to the application and no legitimate interest in the
further provision of information can be proven. A legitimate interest is constituted in particular if the personal data has been modified without notice
being given to the data subject;

b.

the provision of information entails an exceptionally large amount of work.

The share of the costs amounts to a maximum of 300 francs. The applicant must be
notified of the amount of the share before the information is provided and may
withdraw his request within ten days.
