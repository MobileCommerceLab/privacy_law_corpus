The Civil Code has been promulgated by Us at a time when ehe pro"..,
achieved by Ethiopia requires the modemisation of the legal framework 01
Our Empire's social structure so as to keep pace with the c1umpn, circumstances of ehis world of today. In order to consolidate the progreu already
achieved and to facilitate yet further growth and development, precise and
detailed rules must be laid down regarding those problems which do not only
jace the individual citizen bue ehe nation. as a whole. The rules contained in
this Code are in harmony with the well-established legal tradUioru 01 0Ul'
Empire and the principles enshrined in. the Revised Constitution. granted by
Us on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of Our CorOJUltion. and haw called,
as well, upon the best systems of law in the world.
No law which is designed to define the rights and duties of eluJ people
and to set out the principles governing their mutual relaeioru can. ever be
effective if it fails eo reach ehe heare of ehose to whom it is intended to apply
and does not respond to their needs and customs and to natural juseice. In
preparing the Civil Code, the Codification Commission convened by U. and
whose work We have directed has constantly borne in mind the special requirements of Our Empire and of Our beloved subjects and has been inspired in
v

its labours by the genius of Ethiopian legal traditions
revealed by the ancient and tJenerable Fetha Neguest.

and inatitraioru as

It is essential that the law be clear and intelligible to each and etJery
citizen of Our Empire. so that he may without difficulty ascertain what are his
rights and duties in the ordinary course of life, and this has been accomplished
in the Civil Code. It is equally important that a law which embraces a wried
and diverse subject matter, as is the case with the Civil Code, form a c0nsistent and unified whole, and this requirement, too, is fully satisfied by the
law which We promulgate today.
The careful preparation of this Code by the Codification Commission and
the pains taking review which it has received in OrU"Parliament assure that
this law will achieve the purpose for which it is intended. With the guidance
of the Almighty, Fountain of Justice and Source of all wisdom and benefits,
this Code will contribute to the progress of Our Empire and the welfare of
Our beloved subjects of today and of the future.
Given in the 30th year of Our Reign, this 5th day of May, 1960.
