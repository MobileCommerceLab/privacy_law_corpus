1. INTRODUCTION
To process personal data legitimately under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the Data Protection Act 2004
(“DPA”) organisations need to have a ‘lawful basis’. Identifying the lawful basis that an organisation relies on to process personal
data is a fundamental step in ensuring data protection compliance.
The GDPR and the DPA list the lawful bases that organisations can rely on, depending on the ‘category’ of personal data i.e. whether
the information is ‘personal data’, ‘a special category of personal data’ or ‘data relating to criminal convictions and offences’. This
Guidance Note aims to identify the lawful bases that are available for organisations to rely on, for each category, in a practical and
concise manner.
The information provided should be treated as guidance with appropriate consideration being given to the actual legal requirements.
Footnotes referencing the legislation are included so that readers are able to link and relate the guidance to the specific provisions
in the law.

2. GENERAL GUIDANCE
•

The lawful basis that is most appropriate to use will depend on the circumstances of the organisation and purposes of the
processing.

•

Most lawful bases require that processing is ‘necessary’. In these cases, the lawful basis cannot be relied on when an
organisation can reasonably achieve the same purpose without the processing.

•

Organisations must identify and document its lawful basis, including the reasoning for relying on the lawful basis identified,
before it begins collecting and using personal data. This is important and useful as the accountability principle1 requires
organisations to be able to demonstrate compliance. It is also important and necessary for the transparency requirements,
which oblige organisations to inform individuals upfront about the lawful basis that they rely on to process their information2.

•

Organisations may find that more than one lawful basis could apply in a particular case. If so, the organisation may identify
and document all of them. In some cases, more than one basis applies to the processing because the processing has more
than one purpose, and if this is the case this should be identified from the start.

•

If a public authority can demonstrate that the processing is to perform tasks as set down in Gibraltar law, then it will be able
to use the public task basis. If not, it may still be able to consider consent or legitimate interests in some cases, depending
on the nature of the processing and its relationship with individuals. There is no absolute ban on public authorities using
consent or legitimate interests as their lawful basis, but the GDPR does restrict public authorities’ use of these two bases.

3. THE THREE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL
DATA
The law differentiates between ‘personal data’, ‘special categories of personal data’ and ‘data relating to criminal convictions and
offences’.
•

Personal data - in summary, if you can associate information with an individual, it is personal data. e.g. name, address, IP,
telephone number, physical characteristics, life history, location data, etc… The law defines personal data as follows –
‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data
subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an
online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;

Within the broad definition of personal data, the law gives a distinctive status to certain types of personal data, which are defined
as ‘special categories of personal data’ and ‘data relating to criminal convictions’. Both categories are considered more sensitive,
require greater protection and can only be processed in more limited circumstances.
•

Special categories of personal data – defined in law as follows –
personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,
or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of
uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's
sex life or sexual orientation.

•

Data relating to criminal convictions and offences – defined simply as data relating to criminal convictions and offences or
related security measures.

4. PERSONAL DATA
The lawful bases that organisations can rely on to process personal data are the following –
4.1.

Consent3: the individual has given clear consent to process their personal data for a specific purpose.

4.2. Contract4: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to
take specific steps before entering into a contract.
4.3. Legal obligation5: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).

4.4. Vital interests6: the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.
4.5. Public task7: the processing is necessary for –
4.5.1. the administration of justice8;
4.5.2. the exercise of a function of parliament9;
4.5.3. the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment or rule of law10; or
4.5.4. the exercise of a function of a Minister or a government department11.
4.6. Legitimate interests12: the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third
party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests.
(This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to perform your official tasks.)

5. SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL
DATA
When an organisation collects and uses a special category of personal data, it must identify both a lawful basis in the foregoing
paragraph 4 and one of the following:
5.1.

Explicit consent13: the individual has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more
specified purposes.

5.2. Employment, social security and social protection14: the information is necessary for one of the following15 –
5.2.1. performing obligations imposed on the organisation in connection with employment, social security or social
protection; or
5.2.2. exercising the rights of an individual in connection with employment, social security or social protection.
5.3. Vital interests16: the processing is necessary to protect the life of the individual when they are physically or legally
incapable of giving consent.
5.4. Not for profit use17: the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a
foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and
on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who

developments. In the event of any conflict or inconsistencies between this Guidance Note and the GDPR and the DPA, the GDPR and
