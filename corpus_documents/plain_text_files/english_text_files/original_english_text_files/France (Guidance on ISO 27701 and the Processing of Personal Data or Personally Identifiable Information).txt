ISO 27701, an international standard addressing personal
data protection
02 April 2020

ISO 27701 is an international standard which defines the management system and
security requirements for the processing of personal data (in 27701 context,
Personally identifiable information (PII)).

ISO 27701 was published in August 2019. It is based on two information security standards and extends them to
cover personal data protection:

.
.

ISO 27001, that provides certification of an information security management system;
ISO 27002, that provides guidance to implement the necessary security measures.

ISO 27701 requirements
In order to normalize and enhance personal data protection,

.

ISO 27701 extends the ISO information security management systems to cover the specificities of the processing of
personal data:
determination of the role of the organization as a data controller and/or a data processor (in 27701, “PII controller” and
“PII processor”);

.

.
. unified risk management regarding the risks for the organization and for the data subjects (in 27701, “PII principals”),
designation of a data protection officer (in ISO 27701, “privacy officer”) ;
. staff members awareness, information classification, protection of removable media, access management, data
encryption, backups, event logging;
. conditions for data transfer, privacy by design and by default, incident management;
. compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, etc.

ISO 27701 provides specific measures for the processing of personal data, relating to the role of the organization (as
controller, processor or sub-processor) :
fundamental principles: purpose of the processing, legal basis, consent collection and withdrawal, records of the
processing operations, privacy impact assessment;

.
. data subject rights: notice, access, correction, erasure, automated decision;
. privacy by design and by default: minimization, data de-identification and deletion, data retention;
. subcontracts, data transfers and data sharing.

Contributions from experts and data protection authorities
This standard was drafted at international level with contributions from experts from all continents and the
participation of several data protection authorities. Experts from the CNIL actively contributed to this standard,
with support from AFNOR and the European Data Protection Board.
GDPR was taken into account, as well as other data protection legislation (including Australia, Brazil,
California, Canada). The proximity of the standard with GDPR is materialized in a specific annex that maps each
clause of the standard with the corresponding GDPR article. Implementing a management system for data
protection is a key to the general provisions of accountability in the GDPR.
In short, ISO 27701 is a global standard: it is not GDPR specific, nor does it constitute, as such, a GDPR
certification instrument as described in Article 42 of the regulation. However, it represents the state of the art in
terms of privacy protection and will allow organizations adopting it to increase their maturity and demonstrate
an active approach to personal data protection.
