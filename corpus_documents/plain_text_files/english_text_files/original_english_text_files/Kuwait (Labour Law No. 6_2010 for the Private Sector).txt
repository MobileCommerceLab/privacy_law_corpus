EXPLANATORY MEMORANDU

LAW NO. (6) OF 2010
CONCERNING PRIVATE SEC-
TOR LABOUR LAW
EXPLANATORY MEMORAN-
DUM
By the discovery of oil in the State of
- Kuwait as well as the social, econom-
ic and political changes that had re-
sulted and accompanied this discov-
ery, new types of labour had
emerged. Therefore, it was natural
for the legislator to work for organiz-
ing these types of labour in such a
way that shall be consistent with th
nature of these new labours and be
compliant with the spirit of work and
copes with the modern renaissance
and boom that began to prevail in the
different aspects of life in the coun-
try. Hence, the competent persons be-
gan to think of the necessity of issu-

 

 

44

ing a law for the private sector labour
in order to regulate the relationship
between labourers and employers be-
cause this will have positive effects
on the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) on one hand, and coping with
the global attitudes for taking care of
the working class, on the other hand.
The first law for organizing labour in
Kuwait had come out in the year
1959, Then, this law was amended
by virtue of the Amiri Decree No.
(43) of 1960 and thereafter the Law
No. (1) of 1961 until it has been can-
celled by virtue of the Law No. (38)
of 1964 on the Private Sector Labour.
This law had been subject to several
amendments that aimed at securing
special privileges to the labourers
who are working in the oil sector by
virtue of the Law No. (43) of 1968
that added a new Chapter to this law
under Chapter Sixteen concerning the
employment of labourers in the oil
industry. Then, the Law No, (28) of
1969 was issued for canceling and re-
placing this Chapter for regulating
the necessary benefits for Oil Sector-
labourers.
Consequently, the basic law that gov-
erns the labour relations is the Law
No. (38) of 1964 concerning the Pri-
vate Sector Labour. Regarding the
Law No. (28) of 1969, it concerns
particularly the oil labour sector
within the limits of the definitions
and provisions stipulated in this law,
and all other kinds of labour shall be
applicable to the Private Sector La-
bour Law being the general law that
regulates the relationship between the
two parties of production in this sec-
tor. .

Due to the fact that the labour law
has always been targeting a basic aim
that intended to make a fair balance
between the interests of labourers
and their protection on one hand, and
that of the employers on the other
hand, due to the positive effects of
this balance on the Gross Domestic
Product in general.

Now, the Kuwaiti arena has wit-
nessed new developments, social and
economic changes that necessitate
the introduction of a new approach to
the amendments of the existing law.
Also, both the Arab and international
arenas have witnessed many develop-
ments that cannot possibly be ig-

 

nored especially that the State of Ku-
wait is one of the foreign labour
force recruiting countries. For all
these reasons, the urgent necessity
has arisen for amending the current

Law No. (38) of 1964 so as to ac-

commodate and cope with the new
developments, particularly that this
law has been under enforcement for

more than thirty years.

While thinking seriously to amend
this law, two attitudes have emerged
— the first one aims at amending cer-
tain provisions of the current Law in

such a way that complies with the
new developments of the economic
and social changes, and thereafter the
amendments can come successively
whenever there is a need to such
modifications.

As for the second attitude, that ob-
tained the views of the majority of
supporters, aims at issuing a new law
which shall be compliant with the
circumstances of the current stage in-
cluding the new emerging develop-
ments, provided that there should be
taken into consideration upon prepar-
ing the draft of the law the future am-
bitions and realization of the intend-

45
ed goals through the replacement of
the expatriate labour force by the na-
tional labour force - whenever it can
be possible - and this is one of the
main objectives of the State that
should finally be achieved.

The Ministry of Social Affairs & La-
bour has drafted the bill of the at-
tached law in the light of a compres-
sive approach for the labour laws in
the region as well as the International
& Arab Labour Agreements besides
the most recent jurisprudent attitudes
and the judicial principles set forth
by the Kuwaiti judiciary in the cur-

rent law.

Accordingly, several successive com-
mittees have been formed from the
Ministry representatives, employers
who are represented by the Kuwait
Chamber of Commerce & Industry,
and the labourers who are represent-

ed by the General Federation for Ku-
wait Employees for thoroughly ex-

amining and scrutinizing this law.

These committees have carefully dis-

cussed the draft, amended and re-
worded certain articles through many
sessions until the law has been ap-
proved in its semi-final copy which

 

46

has adopted a future approach and
avoided any aspects of shortage or
omission in the current law in order
to put the State of Kuwait in its right
position among those countries with
advanced labour legislations.
Therefore, for the purposes of preva-
lent benefits and realizing the same
goal intended by the legislators to-
wards arriving at the grade of perfec-
tion, the concerned parties have de-
cided to poll the opinion of the

. related governmental authorities rep-

resented by the Public Authority for
Housing Care, Ministry of Com-
merce & Industry, Higher Council
for Planning & Development, Minis-
try of Health, Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of Oil, Kuwait Municipali-
ty, Kuwait University, the Public In-
stitution for Social Security, the Pub-
lic Authority for Applied Education
& Training and the Civil Service
Commission (General Secretariat for
Labour force),

A special committee has been estab-
lished for conducting the necessary
contacts and correspondences with

those authorities and providing them
with the semi-final copy of the draft
law, receive their replies and make
the necessary final review in the light
of the received answers. The re-
sponse of those authorities and their
efforts were all positive where the
committee has been provided with
valuable proposals which are appre-
ciated by the committee and consid-
ered, the thing that has resulted in the
proof reading of the draft law articles
one by one together with re-wording
the necessary articles thereof in the
light of those suggestions as well as
adding new articles or paragraphs
thereto.

The Ministry of Social Affairs & La-
bour, due to its keenness to cope with
the contents of the International
Agreements on labour, especially
those agreements to which the State
of Kuwait has acceded or ratified, the
Ministry has sought the assistance of
the International Labour Organiza-
tion (ILO) within the framework of
the technical aid provided by the ILO
to the Member States and whose ex-
perts have assisted in reviewing cer-
tain provisions of the draft law and
arranged its chapters in such a man-
ner that it is issued in its final current

 

47

form.

The draft of this law comes in seven
chapters, Chapter One is about the
General Provisions; Chapter Two

regulates the Employment, Appren-

ticeship & Vocational Training Pro-
visions; Chapter Three is on the Indi-
vidual Employment Contract;

Chapter Four on Labour Conditions

& System; Chapter Five on Collec-
tive Labour Relations; Chapter Six
on Labour Inspection & Penalties,

and finally Chapter Seven is on the
Concluding Provisions.

In all the foregoing, the draft of the
law has developed new rules & regu-
lations which are deemed necessary
by the legislator comprising more
guarantees to the both parties of pro-
duction in such a manner that ensures
justice and stability in labour rela-
tions in the country and also secures
that these rules & regulations will
cope with similar legislations appli-
cable abroad, especially the Interna-
tional & Arab Agreements duly rati-
fied by the State of Kuwait.
Hereunder we will shed light on the
articles of the law according to the
order of its chapters:
CHAPTER |
GENERAL PROVISIONS

This Chapter comprises the articles
from Article (1) to Article (6), where
Article (1) has specified what is
meant by the term "The Competent
Ministry" and defined it by the Min-
istry of Social Affairs & Labour, and

_ defined "The Competent Minister"
by the Ministry of Social Affairs &
Labour. Also, this Article has defined
term like "Labourer", "Employer"

and the concept of "Organization".
Article (2) has. specified the scope of
enforcement of the law when it de-
cided that it shall be applicable to the
labourers in the private sector. In this
meaning, the definitions assigned to
each of the "Labourer" and the "Em-
ployer" in Article 1 should be consid-
ered so that what is meant by the ex-
pression "the labourers in the private
sector” can be defined clearly.
Article (3) has determined the scope
of the applicability of the draft law to
the marine employment contract in
all which is not particularly provided

 

48

for in the Maritime Law, or the text
of this law shall be more beneficial to
the labourer.

Also, Article (4) provides for the ap-
plicability of the provisions of this
law to the labourers in the Oil Sector
in all which is not particularly pro-
vided for in the Oil Sector Labour
Law, or the text of this law shall be
more beneficial to the labourer.
Article (5) has exempted the labour-
ers whose relationships with their
employers are regulated by other
laws. Regarding the Domestic La-
bourers, i.e. house servants or maids
and the like, this Article has referred
the governing of the relationship be-
tween them and their employers to a
decision to be issued by the compe-
tent Minister for organizing their af-
fairs in this respect.

Article (6) acknowledges a principal
rule which is duly prescribed in juris-
prudence and the judiciary and being
codified by most of the modern legis-
lations. That is to say the provisions
of this law, including all the rights
and benefits stipulated for labourers
therein, represent the minimum limit
for labourers’ rights which shall not
be assigned and any agreement to the
contrary will be deemed as null and
void. As for the better rights and ben-
efits stipulated in collective or indi-
vidual employment contracts or the
applicable rules & regulations by the
employers that exceed what is pro-
-vided for in this law, they should be
enforced and labourers shall be treat-
ed accordingly.

In other words, since the rights and
benefits prescribed for labourers in
this law represent the minimum limit
secured for them by the legislator, no
agreement may be made for affecting
these rights unless such agreement is
more beneficial to labourers, whether
the agreement is made upon entering
into or during the validity of the con-
tract. This is for the purpose of cop-
ing with the spirit of legislation relat-
ed to the public interest on one hand,
and also in implementation to a defi-
nitely confirmed fact that the human
psyche has but to hate anything that
reduces its rights after being pre-

scribed.

CHAPTER 2

his labour force requirements in the
relevant forms prepared for this pur-
pose as well as the type and number
of the labourers in the light of any
expansion or shrinking in his activi-
ty, in periodic basis accordingto the
terms and conditions in respect of
which a decision shall be issued-by
the competent Minister.
Article (9) decides the establishment
of public authority of a separate legal
entity and an independent budget to
be named: "The Public Authority for
Labour force" under the supervision
of the Minister of Social Affairs &
Labour and it shall carry out the ju-
risdictions prescribed for the Minis-
‘try in this law. Also the authority

shall recruit and employ the expatri-

ate labour force according to the ap-
plications submitted by employers.
Within one year from the enforce-
ment of this law, an organizing law
shall be issued in respect of this au-

thority.

Article (10) determines the rules and
procedures in the employment of
non-Kuwaitis in such a way that gov-
ers the competent Ministry's control
on the labour market and to direct it
in such a manner that conforms to the
goal of the state to gradually replace
the expatriate labour force by the Ku-
waiti labour force. In this connection,
this Article prohibits any employer to
recruit foreign labour force or to em-
ploy labourers from inside the coun-
try without having them to work for
him or if it becomes proven that he is
not actually in need of them.
Furthermore, this Article bans em-
ployers to employ non-Kuwaiti la-
bourers unless they hold labours per-
mits issued by the competent labour
department entitle them to work for
him. This is for treatment of the re-

 

50

cruitment of foreign labour force
more than what is needed on one
hand, and for regulating the labour
market on the other hand, by having
every labourer to work for the em-
ployer who recruited him.
Accordingly, this Article prescribed
that the employer is to bear the ex-
penses for returning the labourer
bach home. Also, the Article binds
the Ministry if the employer's appli-
cation for recruiting foreign labour
force is rejected, such rejection
should be justified; and that the capi-
tal amount should not be taken as a
cause for such rejection, for ensuring
the best supervision over the perfor-
mance of the government in the event
of the
rejection.

At the end of this Article, it provides
that if the labourer discontinue to
come to work and joined work with
another employer, the latter shall un-
dertake to return the employer back
to his country, after filing an ab-
sconding proclamation against the la-
bourer by his main sponsor.
Article (11) stipulates that the Minis-
 

 

try is prohibited to practice any dis-
crimination or preference while deal-
ing with employers for issuance of
work permits or transfers. Also, it au-
thorizes the Ministry, for such rea-
sons it decides, to stop the issuance
of work permits and transfers for a
period not more than two weeks per
year, provided that the Ministry may
not exempt some employers of this
stopping procedure and disregard
others during this period.

SECTION II

APPRENTICESHIP & VOCATION-
AL TRAINING

This Section consists of Articles
from (12 to 18) in which the law in-
troduces the Professional Apprentice-
ship Contract for giving the opportu-
nity for creating a suitable
environment for developing the na-
tional human resources necessary for
burdening the future's responsibili-
ties, particularly upon securing them
the necessary training and education.
Article (12) defines the professional
apprentice, and it has expressly men-

 

5\|

tioned that the professional appren-
tice contract shall be.subject to the
terms and conditions for juveniles’
employment as provided for in this
law.
Article (13) stipulates that the profes-
sional apprenticeship contract shall
be written and issued in three copies,

_ one for each contract party, whereas

the third copy shall be forwarded to
the Competent Authority at the Min-
istry within one week for attestation.
Also, this Article prohibits the fixing

of the remuneration on the basis of
production or piece in order to mani-
fest the educational nature of the pro-

fessional apprenticeship contract
which is different from the ordinary
employment.

Article (14) permits an employer to
terminate the apprenticeship contract
if the apprentice violates his assigned

duties under the contract or if it is
proved from the periodic reports pre-
pared on him that he is not ready to
learn. Similarly, the Article entitles
the apprentice to terminate his con-
tract and fixed seven days as a notice
period which both contract parties
shall observe.

 
After Article (15) has defined what is
meant by vocational training, as ex-
plained in its express words, Article

(16) provides that the competent

Minister shall issue a decision on the

necessary terms & conditions to be
satisfied for holding the vocational
training programs ... etc.

The Article stipulates that the deci-
sion may include the binding of one
establishment or more to provide
training for labourers in other centers
or institutes if the first establishment
hasn't got training centers or insti-
tutes.

Article (17) requires such establish-
ments to pay the labourer his full
wage for his training period whether
within or outside the establishment.
Article (18) binds each of the profes-
sional apprentice and the labourer
trainee to work for the employer, af-
ter the completion of his learning or
training period, for a similar period
of his apprenticeship or training in a
maximum term of five years. It also
gives the employer the right, in case
of breach of these obligations, to re-
imburse from them the expenses he
borne for this learning or training,

 

52

pro-rata the remaining period to be
spent in the work.

SECTION III

EMPLOYMENT OF JUVENILES

This Section consists of Articles
from (19) to (21), whereas Article
(19) prohibits the employment of
those who are under 15 years of age.
Article (20) defines juveniles as
those whose age is falling between
15 and 18 years and allows their em-
ployment by the permission of the
competent Ministry under two condi-
tions, the first one is to be employed
in industries and trades other than
those hazardous & harmful to health,
regarding of which a decision shall
be issued by the Minister; and the
other condition is to be medically ex-
amined, prior to employment, and
thereafter periodically for not more
than six months.

Article (21) fixes the maximum
hours of work for juveniles by 6 (six)
hours per day, provided that they are

not made to work for more than 4
hours continuously, which shall be
followed by at least one hour rest
break. Also, the Article bans juve-
niles to work additional working
hours or during weekly off days, hol-
idays or between 7:00 pm to 6:00
_ am, bearing in mind that these hours
are normally night hours.

SECTION IV
EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN

This Section comprises Articles from
(22) to (26), where Article (22) pro-
hibits the employment of women at

night during 10:00 pm to 7:00 am,
except those: who work in hospitals,

health centers, private treatment
houses and other health institutions
in respect of which a decision shall
be issued by the Minister of Social

Affairs & Labour, provided that the

employer shall ensure the security re-
quirements for women in addition to
the provision of means of transport
from and to the place of work.
Article (23) prohibits the employ-
ment of women in hazardous, hard or
harmful to health trades shall be pro-

‘hibited. Also they shall not be em-

 

53

ployed in such jobs which are harm-
ful to morals and based on the exploi-
tation of their femininity in a manner
which is not consistent with the pub-
lic morals. Moreover, women shall
not be employed in institutions which
provide service exclusively for men.
The Minister of Social Affairs & La-
bour, in consultation with the Con-
sultant Committee for Labour Af-
fairs, shall issue a decision to specify
these jobs and entities.
Article (24) provides that the female
labourer shall be entitled to a paid
maternity leave of 70 (seventy) days
which shall not be included within
her other leaves, provided that the de-
livery shall take place during this pe-
riod, together with granting a female
labourer upon her request, after ex-
piry of the maternity leave, a leave
without pay for not more than four
months.
Also, the employer shall not termi-
nate the service of a female labourer
while she is enjoying her maternity
leave or discontinue joining the work
due to a sickness which shall be
proved by a medical report that it is
resulting from pregnancy or delivery.
Article (25) the legislator stipulates
for granting a female labourer 2
hours break for breast feeding her
child during the working hours, in ac-
cordance with the terms and condi-
tions to be specified by the Minis-

" try’s decision.

Also, he binds the employer to estab-

lish a Day Care Center for children
below 4 years if the number of wom-
en is more than 50 or the number of
employees therein is more than 200,
Article (26) stipulates for equal treat-
ment for the female labourer by giv-
ing her the same salary given to her
male counterpart, if she performs the

_ Same work without any discrimina-
“tion between them, so that the special
regulation provided in this law on the
employment of women shall not be
taken as a justification or reason for
fixing a certain wage for women less
than the recognized prescribed wage

for men for the same work.

CHAPTER III

INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT
CONTRACT

 

54

SECTION 1

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
STRUCTURE

Article (27) defines the labourer’s el-
igibility to sign an employment con-
tract by attaining the age of 15 years
old if the contract is an unlimited pe-
riod contract; and in the case of a
limited period contract, such period
shall not exceed one year until he at-
tains 18 years of age. This provision
is in line with the provision of Article
(94) of the Civil Law in this respect.
Article (28) stipulates that the con-
tract should be prepared in writing
and it shall contain all the details re-
lated to the contract. Also, the con-
tract shall be issued in (three copies,
one for each party whereas the third
copy shall be forwarded to the com-
petent department). If the contract is
not prepared in a written document,
in this case the labourer shall prove
his right through all evidencing meth-
ods.
Article (29) is keen to stipulate that
all the contracts shall be prepared in
Arabic language and the translation
of which in any foreign language
may be added to it, but the Arabic
language shall legally prevail in case
of any discrepancies. Also, what is
applicable to contracts shall be appli-
cable to all correspondence, bulletins,
bylaws and circulars issued by the
employer to his labourers.
Article (30) confirms that if the em-
ployment contract is a limited period
contract, its term shail not exceed 5
years and not less than one year to-
gether with it may be renewed upon
expiry by the agreement of both par-
ties.
Article (31) prescribes that if the em-
ployment contract is-a limited period
contract and both parties continue to
implement after the expiry of its term
without renewal, it shall be automati-
cally renewable for similar periods
under the same conditions contained
therein, unless the two parties agree
to renew it under other conditions.
In any case, if the limited period con-
tract is renewed, this shall not affect
the labourer's accrued rights arising
from the previous contract, and the
labourer shall be entitled to the ac-
quired rights under the previous con-

 

55

tract.

SECTION 2
ON THE OBLIGATIONS OF LA-
BOURER & EMPLOYER
AND DISCIPLINARY PENALTIES

Article (32) provides that the proba-
tion period shall be specified in the
employment contract but precondi-
tioned that it shall not exceed 100
working days. Like the text as men-
tioned in the Law No. 38 of 1964,
this Article provides that the labourer
may not be employed under the pro-
bation period with the same employ-
er for more than once, and this it has
clarified the ambiguous in the said
law when it gives the right to both
parties to terminate the contract dur-
ing the probation period. However, if
the termination is made by the em-
ployer, he shall pay the labourer his
end of service remuneration for his
employment period accordingto the
provisions of this law.
Article (33) came similar to the pro-
vision of the Law No. 38 of 1964 in
terms of the necessity of equal treat-
ment between all labourers if the em-
ployer subcontracts work to any oth-
er employer under the same work
conditions under the same working
conditions, the labourers of both par-
ties shall be treated equally and the
two employers shall jointly work to-
gether to pay the dues of the labour-
ers of the main employer.
Article (34) binds the employers who
are involved in the execution of gov-
ermmental projects or those who
make their labourers work in such ar-
eas which are remote from the inhib-.
ited areas, they shall provide a suita-
ble accommodation and means of
transport for their labourers, confirm-
ing that it shall be free of charge.
And in the event of not providing
them an accommodation, the employ-
er shall give them a suitable housing
allowance. Remote areas and suitable
accommodation conditions as well as
the housing allowance shall be deter-
mined by a decision from the Minis-
ter.
Articles from (35) to (40) explain the
disciplinary rules & regulations to be
observed by the employer before ap-
plying any penalty on his labourers
as well as the necessary guarantees

 

56

for reserving the labourers’ rights to
defend himself and refute the contra-

ventions attributed to him. Also, the

employer undertakes to approve the
penalties bylaw before the applica-
tion of its provisions by the compe-
tent Ministry which shall have the

right to enter any amendments there-

to in such a way which is in line with
the nature and circumstances of the

work.

Article 38 provides for the principle
of not exceeding the deduction which
may be executed from the labourer’s

wage for a period of more than 5
days per month. Article 39 has intro-
duced the principle of suspending the
labourer to perform his work for the

interest of the investigation but the
suspension shall not exceed 10 days,
together with reserving his right to
receive his salaries for the period of
suspension if the investigation con-
cludes that he is not responsible.
Article (40) is introduced in this Sec-
tion and after it prescribed the em-
ployer’s compliance to deposit the
deduction proceeds from the wages
of his labourers in a fund to be allo-
cated for social, economic and cultu-
ral activities for the benefit of the la-
bourers; and after it prescribed the
employer’s obligation to keep a spe-
cial record for the deductions made
against the labourers, the Article in-
troduced a provision for the distribu-
tion of the deduction proceeds availa-
ble in the fund among the existing
labourers in the firm equally in the
event of its dissolution for any rea-
son. Also, this Article provides that
the Minister shall issue a decision on
the rules & controls organizing the
above fund and the distribution meth-
od.

SECTION III
TERMINATION OF EMPLOY-
MENT CONTRACT &

END OF SERVICE INDEMNITY
This Section consists of Articles
from (41) to (55). In Article (41), the
legislator explained the cases in
which an employer may terminate
the labourer’s service without notice,
indemnity or remuneration. This Ar-
ticle is similar to Article (48) in
which a labourer may terminate the
employment contract without notice
together with his entitlement to the
full end of service indemnity. Also,

 

this Article explains the cases in
which a labourer shall be entitled to
the end of service indemnity upon his
termination. Morover, it gives the ter-
minated labourer the right to appeal
the termination decision before the
‘ competent Labour Circuit. If it is
proved that the employer has termi-
nated the labourer in an arbitrary
way, he shall be entitled to an end of
service indemnity and compensation
for the damages incurred by him as a
result of such termination. Further-
more, this Article binds the employ-
er, in all cases, to inform the Ministry
by the termination.decision and its
causes, and the latter shall advise the
Labour force Restructuring Program
accordingly.
Article (42) entitles the employer, if
a labourer discontinues work for sev-
en consecutive days or twenty inter-
rupted days within one year, to deem
him as resigned. In this case, the pro-
visions of Article (53) shall be appli-
cable on the labourer’s eligibility to
the end of service indemnity.
Article (43) comprises new provi-
sions governing a labourer’s dues if
he is imprisoned under a preventive

57
imprisonment or in execution to a
non-final court judgment due to a
charge by the employer, and decided
to deem him as suspended from the
work and the employer shall not ter-
minate his employment contract un-
less he is convicted in a final judg-
ment. If a court judgment is issued
on his innocence the employer
should be obliged to pay him his
wage for the period of suspension in
a fair compensation to be decided by
the court.

Article (44) mentions the procedure
to be followed upon the termination
of an unlimited period contract where
either shall notify the other at least
three months prior to the termination
of the contract in the event of month-
ly salary labourers; and at least one
month in case of other labourers.
Also, this Article determines the
compensation to be payable by the
party who terminated the contract if
he does not observe the notice period
by an amount equal to the labourer’s
salary for the same period.
Article (45) prohibits the employer to
use the right of termination author-
ized to him under the above Article

 

 

(44) while the labourer or female la-

bourer enjoys one of his leaves pro-

vided for in this law in order to pro-

tect the labourer not to be surprised

of being terminated while enjoying
any of his leaves.

Also Article (46) prohibits the em-
ployer to terminate the labourer con-
tract unless this is based on the la-
bourer’s abilities, behavior or the
firm or firm's operation require-
ments. In particular, Article 46 does
not consider the contract termination
reasons by the employer because
they are related to the basic rights
duly guaranteed under the constitu-
tion and the international agreements
that secure the labourer’s right to ac-
cede to or join labourers trade un-
ions, exercise his trade union right,
freedom of faith, litigation and that
nothing shall affect his rights due to
the racial or sectarian beliefs.
Article (47) explains the rules of
compensation which both parties to
the limited period employment con-
tract shall be complied with if termi-
nated by either party prematurely
without having any right to do so, he
shall then be obliged to compensate
the other party for the damage in-
curred by him for an amount equal to
the labourer’s wage for the remaining
period of the contract, provided that
upon determining the damage for
both contract parties the prevailing
customs, work nature, ... etc. and
generally all other considerations
which may affect the damage in
terms of its existence and extent.
The same Article has decided the
swap or setoff principle between any
debts which may be due for the em-
ployer and the compensation amount
fér the labourer.

Article (48) provides for the cases in
which the labourer may terminate the
employment contract together with
his entitlement to the end of service

indemnity. -

Article (49) and Article (50) the con-
tract termination cases by the force of
the law, whereas Article 49 explains
the contract termination cases for a
reason related to the death of the la-
bourer or if it is proved that he is dis-
able to perform his duty or by reason
of the expiry due to the exhaustion of
his sick leaves, while Article (50) ex-
plains the employment contract ter-

 

59

mination cases represented the firm's
transfer to a third party through sell-
ing or merging or inheritance, dona-
tion or any other legal action, or the
final lockout of the firm or the issue
of a final judgment on the employ-
ers bankruptcy.

If the firm is transferred to a third
party accordingto the above means,
Article (50) prescribes that the la-
bourers~ dues shall become a payable
debt by the assignor and assignees
jointly. Also, it authorizes labourers
to continue work with the person to
whom the firm is transferred together
with binding the latter by the obliga-
tions arising from the employment

contract signed by the assignor.

Article (51) provides for the end of
service indemnity due for labourers
working on monthly salary basis as
well as the other classes. For the first
class, this Article decides fifteen-
day-wage for every one year service
of the first five years and thereafter
one month salary for every year of
the following years provided that the
total indemnity shall not exceed one
and a half year wage.

 
As for the second class, it prescribes
ten day wage, for every one year ser-
vice of the first five years and a fif-

- teen day wage for every one year ser-
vice for the following years,
provided that the total indemnity
shall not exceed a year wage. The
Article prescribes in both cases that
the a labourer shall be entitled to the
end of service indemnity for any
fractions of the year in proportion to
the period of service he spent in the
work; and binds the employer to pay
the net difference between the
amounts he affords against the la-
bourer’s subscription in the social se-
curity and the due amounts for the
end of service indemnity.

Article (52) explains the cases in
which a labourer shall be entitled to
the full end of service indemnity.
Article (53) clarifies the partial enti-
tlement cases to the end of service in-
demnity if the labourer tenders his
resignation in an unlimited period
contract from his part, when it made
him be entitled to half the end of ser-
vice indemnity if the term of his ser-
vice is not less than three years and

 

 

60

did not complete five years. If the pe-
riod of his service has reached five
years and did not complete ten years,
he shall be entitled to two-thirds of
the indemnity. If the term of the la-
bourer service has reached ten years,
he shall be entitled to the full indem-

‘ nity.

Thereafter, comes Article (54) and
stipulates that the labourer whose
employment contract is terminated
shall obtain from the employer a ser-
vice termination certificate compris-
ing a statement of his period of ser-

vice or experience.

The Article also prohibits employers
that this certificate shall not include
any expressions which may insult the
labourer or it may be issued in such a
form that may reduce the chances of
work before him; and it bound the
employer to return to the labourer
any documents or certificates which
may be submitted by him.

CHAPTER IV

LABOUR SYSTEM & CONDI-
TIONS
This Chapter consists of Four Sec-
tions and Articles from (55) to (97):

SECTION I: WAGES
This Sections comprises the Articles
from (55) to (97), where Article (55)
defines the meaning of the word |
“Wage” by the basic salary received
or should be received by the labourer
against his performance of the work
including all other elements provided
for in the contract like the allowances
and remunerations or prescribed by
the employer’s rules & regulations.
The concept of wage shall not in-
clude the bonuses & grants which
may be paid voluntarily by the em-
ployer to the labourer.

Also, it shall not include the amounts
or other privileges received by the la-
bourer for meeting the actual expens-
es or necessary expenditure required
for the performance of the work or
by the reason of the work nature like
the car allowance allocated for the
work trips or the accommodation
provided for the watchmen of the real
estates or buildings and the means of
transport which the employer pro-

 

61

vides for his labourers in remote are-
as. All these latter benefits are not
deemed as wage and shall not be in-
cluded therein.
However, the wage shall include the
social allowance and children allow-
ance as per the Law No. (19) of 2000
or any other financial privileges
granted by the state to the labourer
periodically.
Moreover, this Article has added a
new provision for dealing with the
wage when it is a share of the net
profits and stipulated at the end of
this Article that if a labourer wage is
fixed as a share of the net profit and
the firm did not realize profit or real-
ized a very few profit so that the la-
bouret’s share becomes not consis-
tent with the work performed by him,
then his wage should be estimated on
the basis of a similar wage or accord-
ing‘to the prevailing customs in this
profession or for justice require-
ments.

Article (56) is quite keen to provide
that wages shall be paid on a working
day in the legal currency in circula-
tion, and fixed a certain limit for pay-
ing labourers’ wages who work on
monthly basis at least once a month,
and the other labourers shall be paid
their wages at least once every two
weeks. Also, this Article added that
the payment of wages shall not be de-

layed after the seventh day of the due .

date.

Article (57) binds the employer who
employs labourers accordingto the
provisions of this law and the Oil
Sector Law No. (28) of 1969 to de-

posit the dues of his labourers in their
relevant accounts opened with local
financial institutions and a copy of
the statements be dispatched to the
Ministry
Article (58), for avoiding any damag-
es to labourers, does not allow an
employer to transfer a labourer who
works in a monthly salary to another
class without his written consent and
without prejudice to the rights ob-
tained by the labourer during his
work under the monthly salary.

In order to protect the labourers’s
rights, Article (59) provides that the
employer shall not deduct more than
10% of labourer’s wage for the set-
tlement of any debits or loans due to
the employer, and no interests may

 

be received against such dues.
Also, it provides that the attachment
of the wage due to the labourer or de-
duction of any part thereof may not
be made, save within the limit of

_ (25%) for settling a debt of alimony,
" food, clothes and other debts, includ-

ing the employer debts. In the event
of coincidence, alimony debt shall
have priority over other debts.
The legislator, in order to enhance
the protection of labourers, Article
(60) provides that a labourer shall not
be obliged to buy any foodstuff or
commodities from certain shops or to
buy from the employer’s products.
Article (61) has introduced a new
provision that binds an employer to
pay the wages of his labourers during
the lockout period if they have no in
this lockout. Also, the employment
contract shall not be terminated for
the same reason.

Article (62) is quite serious to con-
firm the applicable principle in the
Law No. (38) of 1964, i.e. upon cal-
culation of labourer ducs, the last sal-
ary paid to the labourer shall be con-
sidered. If a labourer receives a
wage on the basis of piece work, the
relevant estimate shall be made on
the average wage duly paid to him
for the actual working hours during
the last three months. The estimation
of cash and in kind incentives shall

. be made by dividing the average of

what is received by the labourer from
the wage during the last 12 months

into the entitlement. If the term of his
service is less than one year, the av-

erage shall be calculated based on the
percentage period spent in the ser-

vice; and in addition to that a labour-

er's wage shall not be reduced during

the course of his work for any reason

whatsoever.

Article (63) has introduced a new
provision that requires, by a decision
from the competent Minister, the
preparation of schedules on the mini-
mum limit of wages accordingto the
nature of profession and trade, for re-
sponding to future requirements and
coping with the modern trends for
setting a minimum limit of wages for
securing a reasonable standard of liv-
ing for labourers and in such a man-
ner that shall act as a motivation for
the Kuwaiti labuor force and encour-
agement to join work in the private

 

63

sector. The decision shall be issued
after consultation with the Consultant
Committee for Labour & Organiza-
tion Affairs.

SECTION II

WORKING HOURS & WEEKLY
OFF DAYS
This Section comprises Articles from
(64) to (69), where Article (64) has
fixed the weekly working hours by
48 hours, as a general principle, in
such a manner that a labourer shall
not be made to work for more than 8
hours a day. Here the provision of
Article (33) of the Law No. (38) of
1964 is amended which was stipulat-
ed as "A labourer manot be made to
work for more than 8 hours per day
or 48 hours a week" where the opin-
ion is different about the optional
word "or" in terms of the extent of
the possibility of increasing the num-
ber of the daily working hours to
more than 8 hours when it is satisfied
by the maximum limit of the working
hours by 48 hours a week. So, for fi-
nalizing this debate, the views came
to the conclusion that the old text
shall be replaced by the current text
as provided in this law.
Accordingly, Article (64) pus it in a
decisive way that the labourers*
working hours shall be 48 hours per
week and the daily working hours
shall not exceed 8 hours except in the
cases provided for in the law. This is
in order to stick to the opinion which
says that the labourer should be pro-
tected in every day of his working
days, and therefore stipulates that the
daily working hours should not be
more than 8 hours save within the
limits of the exceptions stipulated in
the law.

Also, this Article has introduced a
new provision which stipulates that
the working hours during the holy
month of Ramadan shall be 36 hours
a week.

Moreover, the same article provides
that the working hours of hard la-
bour, health harmful labour and haz-
ard labour or for hard conditions may
be reduced by a decision from the

. Minister.
Article (65), after having acknowl-
edged the provision of the second
paragraph of Article (33) of the Law

 

64

No. (38) of 1964 which prohibits
making a labourer work for more
than five continuous hours per day

without being followed a break peri-

od of not less than one hour and such
break hours shall not be calculated
within the working hours, but it ex-

empted from this provision the bank-
ing, financial and investment sector

where the working hours shall be
eight continuous hours,

Thereafter, this Article has intro-
duced a new provision necessitated

by the practical requirements and al-

lows, upon the approval of the Minis-
ter, labourers may be made to work
without any break for technical or

emergency reasons or in office

works, provided that the total worked
hours per day shall be, accordingto
the provision of Article 64 herein, at

least one hour less.

Article (66) sets forth the rules &
regulations for overtime hours where
it provides that a labourer may be
made to work an additional period by
a written order from the employer if
that is necessary for preventing the
occurrence of a dangerous accident
or for the repair of any faults arising
thereof or for avoiding a certain loss
or meeting such works more than the
daily required work. Also, it fixed
the overtime working hours per day,
week and per year; and that the addi-
tional work periods shall be added by
25% of ordinary wage for the same
period and the employer is bound to
keep a special record for the overtime
work.

Article (67) gives the labourer the
right to one fully paid weekly rest
day which shall be fixed by 24 con-
tinuous hours after every six worked

| days. However an employer, for the
work requirements and necessity,
may make a labourer to work during
his weekly rest day if the work condi-
tions so requires. In this case, the la-
bourer shall receive at least 50% of
his wage in addition to the original
wage and he shall be compensated
another day for his rest day.
Article (68) fixes the official holi-
days granted to a labourer with full
pay as per the number stated thercin
and fixed the total due official holi-
days for the labourer by 13 days a
year.
If the work circumstances require

 

65

keeping any labourer in work on any
of the official holidays, he shall be

paid a double wage, i.e. his ordinary

salary multiplied into two alongwith
an alternative compensation day.

This double wage shall be taken as a
basis for calculating the overtime

hours necessitated by the wok condi-

tions in this day.

The due sick leaves in the light of the
provision of Article 69 have become,
on condition that the sickness shall
be proved by a medical certificate, as
follows:

- 15 days with full wage
- 10 days with three quarter wage
- 10 days with half wage
- 10 days with quarter wage
- 30 days without wage
The sickness that requires a sick
leave shall be proven by certificate
from the physician determined by the
employer or the doctor in-charge in a
government health center. In the
event of any conflict regarding the el-
igibility to the sick leave or its term,
then the medical doctor certificate
shall prevail.

The last paragraph stipulates that re-
garding serious diseases which are
difficult to cure, they shall be ex-
empted by a decision from the com-
petent Minister which shall specify
_ the type of such diseases.

SECTION III
PAID ANNUAL LEAVES

__ This Section consists of Articles
from (70) to (79), where Article (70)
has increased the labourer‘s right to
the annual leave by making it thirty

(30) days for every service year.
Also, a labourer shall be entitled to
leave for the fractions of the year in

proportional to the period spent in
work, even if during the first year of
service.

Official holidays and sick leave days
falling within the leave shall not be
counted in the annual leave.
Article (71) added that the labourer
shall be entitled to be paid his due
wage for the annual leave in advance
before enjoying his leave in order to
prepare his affairs.

Article (72) gives the employer the
right to fix the date of annual leave,
and may grant it partially upon secur-

 

66

ing the consent of the labourer after
the expiry of the first fourteen days
thereof. Also, it gives the labourer
the right to accumulate his leaves
provided that they shall not exceed
the leave of two years. Also, he may
enjoy the leave in one time upon the
consent of the employer. Moreover,
annual leaves may be accumulated
by the mutual agreement of both par-
ties for more than two years.
Article (73) provides for the labour-

er’s right to receive a cash equivalent

against his accumulated annual leave

days upon the expiry of the contract,
taking into consideration the provi-
sions of Articles (71 , 71) herein.

Article (74) does not gives the la-
bourer the right to waive his annual
leave, with or without compensation

for the lofty aims intended by the leg-
islator when prescribed this leave,
namely the labourer’s comfort and
reactivation of his working spirits.
Therefore, this Article gives the em-
ployer the right to refund from the la-
bourer any wage paid by him against
the leave if it is proven that he is
working during his leave with an-
other employer.

As encouragement for labourers to
study and education, Article (75) has
introduced a new provision stipulates

that the employer may grant the la-
bourer a paid leave for education for
obtaining a higher qualification in the

field of his work, provided that the
labourer shall undertake to work for
him a period equal to the education
leave period in a maximum limit of
five years. If the labourer violates
this condition, he shall be obliged to
reimburse the wages received by him
during the leave period in proportion
to the remaining period to be spent
by the labourer in the work.

Also, Article (76) has introduced a
new provision stipulates that the la-
bourer who spent two continuous
years in the service of his employer
shall have the right to a paid leave of
21 days for performing Haj rituals,
provided that he should not have pre-
viously performed the Haj.
Moreover, Article (77) introduced a
new type of leaves when it stipulates
that the labourer shall be entitled to a
fully paid leave of three days upon

 

the death of a first or second grade
relative.

A female Muslim labourer whose
husband passes away shall be entitled
to a fully paid leave of 4 (four)
months & 10 (ten) days as from the

' ‘date of death for the period of wait-

ing (iddat), provided that she shall
not practice any work with a third
party for the entire leave period. The
conditions for granting such leave
shall be organized by a decision from
the Minister.

Also, a non-Muslim female labourer
whose husband passes away shall be
entitled to a fully paid leave of 21
days.

Article (78) has also introduced an-
other leave with full pay that the em-
ployer shall have the right to grant
the labourer a fully paid leave for at-
tending Labour Periodic Conferences
& Social Gatherings. The Minister
shall issue a decision on the condi-
tions, rules & regulations organizing
this leave.

Article (79) entitles the employer to
grant the labourer, upon his request,
a special leave without pay in addi-
tion to the other leaves referred to in
this Section.

SECTION IV

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY &
HEALTH

This Section comprises Articles from
(80) to (97), and it is divided into two
branches:

First Branch: On Maintaining Rules
of Occupational Safety & Health
This Branch consists of Articles from
(80) to (88), where Articles from (80)
to (83) explain the types of records
and files which an employer should
maintain for his labourers and shall
consist of all the required entries of
the necessary information about all
types of the different leaves, work in-
juries, occupational diseases, occupa-
tional health & safety, service start
date, service termination date, and all
necessary data and records in the
light of these articles, together with
binding the employer to hang in a
conspicuous place at the work center
the bylaws of penalties, working
hours system, weekly off days and

 

68

official holidays in addition to the
provision of the necessary occupa-
tional health & safety means in such
a way that protects labourers against
the work hazards, and the labourer
shall not be burdened with any ex-
penses or deducting any amounts
from his wage against the provision
of protection means for him.
Article (84) requires the employer to
explain to the labourer, before under-
taking his work, the hazards which
he may be exposed to and the neces-
sary protection means he should take.
The Minister shall issue the neces-
sary decisions on the instructions and
precautionary warning sign boards to
be fixed in conspicuous places in the
work center, and the personal safety
tools which the employer shall sup-
ply for the different activities.
Article (85) stipulates that the Minis-
ter, upon taking the opinion of the
competent authorities, shall issue a
decision specifying the types of ac-
tivities which shall comply with the
provision of the necessary equipment
and tools for labourers’ safety & oc-
cupational health, along with the ap-
pointment of the specialized techni-
clans or specialists for operating
these equipments.

In the meantime when Article (86)
requires the employer to take the nec-
essary precautionary measures for
protecting labourers, Article (87) re-
quires the labourers, likewise, to use
the necessary protection means, and
to undertake to utilize carefully any
protection means under their posses-
sion and to execute the relevant in-
structions issued in this respect.
The legislator, in order to enhance
the protection of labourers, Article 88
obliges the employer to make the
necessary insurance coverage over
his labourers with insurance compa-
nies against work injuries and occu-
pational diseases, together with tak-
ing into consideration the provisions
of the Social Security Law.
SECOND BRANCH

WORK INJURIES & OCCUPA-
TIONAL DISEASES

This Branch consists of Articles from
(89) to (97). In this branch the legis-
lator introduced a new provision
which provides in Article (89) that

 

69

the following provisions related to
work injuries and occupational dis-
eases shall not be applicable to the
insured persons who are subject to
the insurance provisions for the work
injury stipulated in the Social Securi-
ty Law upon its application on them.
In Article (90), it explains the actions
which the employer — or the labourer
if his condition permits - shall take
upon the occurrence of the injury as
well as the authorities to be informed
thereof,

Article (91) stipulates that the em-
ployer shall bear the expenses of the
injured labourer treatment against
work injuries and occupational dis-
eases with a governmental hospital or
a private clinic to be specified by
him, including the value of the medi-
cine and transport expenses
The attending doctor shall specify in
his report the treatment period, the
percentage of disability resulting
from the injury and to what extent
the labourer is able to continue the
performance of his work. All this
shall be without prejudice to the pro-
visions of the Law No. (1) of 1999
on health insurance. Also this Article
entitles each of the labourer and the

employer may object to the medical
report before the Medical Arbitration
Corhmittee at the Ministry of Health.
Article (92) binds every employer to
provide the Ministry of Health with
Statistical statement about work inju-
ries accidents and occupational dis-

eases that took place at his firm on

periodic basis.

Article (93) gives the labourer who
suffers a work injury or occupational
disease the right to receive his full
wage for the entire treatment period
fixed by the medical doctor. If the
treatment period exceeds six months,
he shall be entitled only to half the
wage until his recovery or proven
disability or death.

Article (94) stipulates that the injured
labourer or his beneficiaries shall be
entitled to receive compensation for
work injuries or occupational diseas-
es accordingto the schedule to be is-
sued by a decision from the Minister,
upon taking the opinion of the Minis-
ter of Health.

Article (95) refers to the cases in
which the injured labourer shall be
deprived of his right to the compen-

BC

 

70

sation for the injury and the scope of
this depriving.

Article 96 extends the prescribed pro-
tection to the labourer under the to
the provisions of Articles (93, 94, 95)
of this law if he suffers from a occu-
pational disease or any relevant
symptoms are developed on him
even after leaving the service within
one year.

Article (97) binds the previous em-
ployers for whom the labourer has
worked, each in proportion to the pe-
riod spent by the labourer in his ser-
vice, to compensate the labourer or
his beneficiaries for his injury as per
the manner stipulated in this text, and
gives the insurance company or the
Public Institution for Social Security
the right to claim, after compensating
the labourer or his beneficiaries, for
the compensation as provided for in
paragraph (1) of this Article.

CHAPTER V

COLLECTIVE LABOUR RELA-
TIONS

SECTION I
ORGANIZATIONS OF LABOUR-
ERS & EMPLOYERS
AND RIGHT OF TRADE UNIONS

This Chapter consists of Three Sec-
tions and Articles from (98) to (110),
where Article (98) ensures the right
of forming federations by employers
and trade unions by labourers in con-
formity with the provisions of this
law.

Also, this Article prescribes the prin-
ciple of forming federations and
trade unions for labourers and sectors
with their different classes, the pri-
vate, government & oil sectors in
consistence with the principle of free-
dom of forming the associations and
trade unions as prescribed in the Arti-
cle 43 of the constitution, and also in
compliance with the relevant interna-
tional agreements, particularly the
Agreement No. (87) of 1948 on the
freedom of trade unions and securing
the right of accession to trade unions.
Article (99), after confirming the
right of forming trade unions and
federations, it specifies the purpose
for establishing such organizations

 

7

which is represented by looking after
the interests of the members of the
organization, improving their materi-
al and social conditions, and to repre-
sent them before third parties.
Article (100) does not put as a pre-
condition the completion of a certain
number of labourers or employers for
the establishment of a trade union or
federation, as the case may be. Rath-
er, it gives this right in conformity
with the declared principles in the
constitution and the relevant interna-
tional agreements. Also, this Article
has explained the required proce-
dures for forming trade unions or
federations.
Article (101) provides for the basic
information that should be included
in the Articles of Association of the
organization, the rights & obligations
of its members and how to practice
its activity.

Article (102) explains that the elected
board of directors shall, within 15
days from the date of its election, de-
posit the organization incorporation
documents with the Ministry. Also, it
explains the manner of evidencing le-
gal entity of the organization.
Article (103) stipulates that the la-
bourers and employers, upon enjoy-
ing the rights provided for in this
Chapter, shall observe all the applica-
ble laws in the country and shall
practice their activity within the lim-
its of the objectives stated in the arti-
cles of association of the organiza-
tion.

Article (104) obliges the competent
Ministry to direct and guide labour-
ers trade unions and employer’s fed-
erations towards the proper applica-
tion of the law and the manner of
how to make entries in the financial
books & records ... etc. and also stip-
ulates the activities which trade un-

ions are prohibited to practice.
Article (105) gives trade unions the
right, upon the approval of employ-
ers and the competent authorities in
the country, to open canteens & res-
taurants for serving the labourers
within the limit of the establishment.
Article (106) confirms the trade un-
ions right to form federations to take
care of their common objectives, and
also, the right of the federations to
form a general federation provided
that there shall not be more than one

 

 

72

general federation for each of the la-
bourers & employers.

Article (107) stipulates that the feder-
ations, the general federation and
trade unions shall have the right to
accede to Arab or international feder-

‘ ations which they believe that their

interests are related thereto, provided
that they shall inform the Ministry of
the accession date.
Article (108) has mentioned two
methods for the dissolution of em-
ployers & labourers’ organizations:

1. The voluntarily dissolution by a

decision to be issued by the general

assembly according to the organiza-
tion’s article of association.

2. The legal dissolution by virtue
of a court judgment to be issued upon
the request of the competent Ministry
for the dissolution of the board of di-

rectors on the basis of the organiza-

tion’s violation to the provisions of
the law or the articles of association.

Also, this article stipulates that the

court judgment may be appealed
within 30 days from the date of issue
at the Court of Appeal.

The trade union’s property after its
dissolution shall be decided on accor-
dingto the decision of the general as-
sembly, in case of the optional disso-
lution.

_ Article (109) has introduced a new

provision that binds employers to
provide labourers with all the deci-
sions, rules & regulations related to
their rights & obligations
Article (110) authorizes the employer
to dedicate one or more members of
the trade union or federation board of
_ directors for following up the trade
union affairs with the labor depart-
ment or the competent authorities in
the country.

SECTION I
COLLECTIVE EMPLOYMENT
CONTRACT
This Section which consists of Arti-
cles from (111) to (122) is introduced
for governing the collective or group
employment contract which had not
been particularly regulated before un-
der any of the previous labour laws.
Article (111), defines the collective
or group employment contract as the
contract which regulates the work
conditions and circumstances be-
tween one or more labourers trade

 

73

union or federation, on one hand, and
one or more employers or whoever
represents them from employer’s fed-
erations, on the other hand.
Article (112) puts as a precondition
that the collective employment con-
tract should be prepared in writing
and duly signed by both parties. The
consent with regard to labourers”
trade unions and employers* federa-
tions should be issued by the mem-
bers of those organizations accor-
dingto the provisions of the Articles
of Association of the organization.
Article (113) puts it as an obligation
that the collective employment con-
tract should be a limited period con-
tract provided that its term shall not
be more than 3 years. If the two con-
tract parties have continue to imple-
ment the same after the expiry of its
term, then it should maintain its ca-
pacity as a limited period contract for
one year period under the same con-
ditions stated therein. All this shall
be subject to that the contract itself
contains special conditions that con-
flict with the prescribed provision
stipulated in this text.
Article (114) provides that if either
party of the collective employment
contract is not desirous to renew it af-
ter the expiry of its term, he shall in-
form the other party and the compe-
tent Ministry in writing at least three
months from the contract expiry date.
If the contract parties are multiple,
then its termination with regard to
one party shall not result in its termi-
nation with regard to the other par-
ties.
Article (115) sets forth an important
guarantee represented by the nullity
of any condition in this contract if it
violates any provisions stipulated in
the articles of this law except those
conditions that comprise such rights
or privileges in the law which are
more beneficial to the labourers, as a
minimum limit for their rights.
Also, this Article provides that any
conditions or agreement signed be-
fore or after the enforcement of this
law under which the labourer waivers
any right granted by this law shall be
deemed null and void. Also, any rec-
onciliation or quitclaim deed that
comprises a reduction or release from
a labourer’s rights due to him under
the employment contract during its

 

 

74

validity period or three months after
its expiry shall be null and void
whenever it violates the provisions of
this law.

Although the collective employment
contract, like an individual employ-
ment contract, is principally a mutual
satisfaction contract, however, Arti-
cle 116 puts as a precondition for its
effectiveness that it shall be regis-
tered with the competent Ministry
and a summary of which shall be
published in the Official Gazette.
Further, the second paragraph of the
same Article authorizes the compe-
tent Ministry to object to any condi-
tions it deems as violating the law,
and obliges the two parties to amend
the contract within 15 days from the
receipt of such objection, otherwise,
the registration application will be
deemed as if it did not take place.
Article (117) stipulates that this con-
tract may be concluded, either at:

1. The firm's level;
2. The industry level; or

3. The national level.

Also, this Article provides that if the
contract is concluded at the level of
the industry, then it should be signed
by the federation of such industry’s
trade unions; and if it is concluded at
the national level, it should be signed
by the general federation of labour-
ers. Moreover, it deems the conclud-
ed contract at the industry’s level to
be considered as an amendment to
the contract signed at the firm’s lev-
el; and the contract signed at the na-
tional jevel shall be deemed as
amendment to any of the other two
contracts, within the limits of the
common provisions stipulated there-
in.

Article (118) has mentioned the
body-corporates, natural persons and
other classes which shall be subject
to the provisions of the collective
employment contract including, first,
loabourers’ trade unions and federa-
tions that concluded the contract or
joined it after its conclusion; second,
employers or their federations that
signed the contract or joined it after
its conclusion; third, the trade unions
organizing the federation that signed
the contract or joined it after its con-
clusion; and fourth, employers who

 

75

joined the federation that signed the
contract or joined it after its being
concluded. Thus, the text will accom-
modate and contain the largest possi-
ble base of labourers and employers
in the collective employment con-
tract. Consequently, this will ensure
the best factors of group labour rela-
tions stability along with the poten-
tial positive economic and social out-
comes arising thereof.

Article (119) confirms that the la-
bourers’ withdrawal or dismissal
from the trade union shall not affect
their right to enjoy the conditions of
this contract together with their com-
pliance with the obligations stipulat-
ed therein, if such withdrawal or dis-
missal took place subsequent to the
signing the contract or joining it by
the trade union.

For the generalization of the benefits
derived from the positive effects of
the collective employment contract,
Article (120) Those who have not en-
tered into contracts from among the
labourers’ trade unions or federa-
tions, or employers or their federa-
tions, may join the collective em-
ployment contract after the
publication of its summary in the Of-
ficial Gazette by the agreement of

both parties requesting the accession

without any need for taking the con-

sent of the main contracting parties.

The accession shall be made by vir-

tue of an application to be submitted

to the competent Ministry duly

signed by both parties. The approval -

of the competent Ministry to the ac-
cession application shall be pub-
lished in the Official Gazette.
Article (121), has established an im-
portant principle which stipulates
that the collective or group employ-
ment contract signed by the firm’s
trade union shall be applicable to all
labourers of the firm even if they are
not members of such Trade Union,
this shall be without prejudice to any
other provision related to the most
beneficial conditions to the labourer
in an individual employment con-
tract. On the other hand, as for the
contract signed by a federation or
trade union with a specific employer,
it shall be effective only to the la-
bourers of the relevant employer.

The provision of Article (122) adopts

 

76

the principle of proxy on behalf of
the members when‘it established that
the labourers & employers organiza-
tions which are a party of the collec-
tive employment contract may file all
Cases arising out of the breach of the

contract conditions in favor of any
member of such organization without
need for a power of attorney to be is-

sued by him for this purpose.

SECTION II

COLLECTIVE LABOUR DIS-
PUTES
This Section includes Articles from

(123) to (132) which aim at maintain-
ing the stability of labour relations

especially when the dispute involves
large numbers of labourers, due to
the work or its conditions, against

one or more employers.

Article (123) defines the collective or
group labour conflicts as those dis-
putes arising between one or more
employers and all his labourers or
some of them because of labour or
work conditions. Thus, this text has
widened the collective dispute con-
cept so as to be deemed as such if it
arises because of the work and is not
restricted only to just the conditions,
as in Article (88) of the Law No. (38)
of 1964 where the disputes were
deemed as individual even if they are
filed by all the labourers or part of
them if the labour relation still exists
so long as the cause of the dispute or
conflict is related to a certain provi-
sion in the law or the contract.
Therefore, the legislator is quite keen
that the dispute shall bear the collec-
tive description even if the cause of
the dispute is referred to the labour it-
self and not related only to its condi-
tions, as per the manner explained
hereinabove. This is in order to
achieve a stable environment in la-
bour relations whether at the firm, in-
dustry or level or the similar activity
or at the national level, by solving
this dispute and removing its causes
’ within a short time period. Also, this
will reduce the resort to the courts
and intends to minimize the number
of court judgments looked into be-
fore courts.
Article (124) specifies the first ac-
tions to be taken by the dispute par-
ties for solving the collective con-

 

flicts, where both the dispute parties

shall resort to direct negotiation be-
tween the employer or his representa-
tive and the labourers or their repre-
sentatives. Also, this Article
authorizes the competent Ministry
shall have the right to delegate its
representative to attend these negoti-
ations in the capacity of supervisor
and be acquainted of the dispute be-
ginning and aspects.

The second paragraph of this Article
stipulates that in case that the reached
a mutual agreement among them,
then such.agreement should be en-
rolled with the competent Ministry
within 15 days accordingto the rules
& regulations in respect of which a
decision shall be issued by the Minis-
ter.

If the dispute parties failed to reach a
solution as mentioned above, Article
(125) provides that either party to the
dispute may submit an application to
the competent Ministry for the ami-
cable settlement of such dispute
through the Collective Labour Dis-
putes Committee regarding of which
a decision shall be issued by the Min-
ster. The application should be

77
signed by the employer or his author-
ized representative or by the majority
of the dispute labourers or by whom-
ever they authorize to represent them.
Article (126) stipulates for the forma-
tion of a reconciliation committee
and that this disputes reconciliation
committee shall be formed from two
Tepresentatives to be selected by the
employer trade union or the disputing
labourers, two representatives to be
selected by the employer (s) who are
a party of the dispute, and the Chair-
man of the Committee and represen-
tatives of the competent Ministry to
be appointed by the competent Min-
ister by a decision in which he shall
also specify the number of the dis-
pute parties representatives.
The committee may seek the opinion
of whoever deems useful for the per-
formance of its task. In all the previ-
ous stages, the competent Ministry
may demand such information it
deems necessary for settling the dis-
pute.

Article (127) fixes the rules and pro-
cedures which the reconciliation
committee shall follow until the stage
for signing a final amicable scttle-

 

78

ment which shall be deemed as a fi-
nal and binding agreement to both
parties. However, if the reconcilia-
tion committee is not able to settle
the dispute within the prescribed pe-
riod, then it shall refer the dispute or
refer the un-agreed upon points there-
of, within one week from the date of
the last meeting of the committee, to
the arbitration board duly accompa-
nied with all the documents.
Article (128) provides for the forma-
tion of the arbitration board of collec-
tive labor disputes which shall be
formed of a circuit of the court of ap-
peals, to be annually appointed by
the general assembly of this court, a
head of prosecution to be delegated
by the Public Prosecutor, a represen-
tative for the competent Ministry to
be appointed by its Minister. The par-
ties of the dispute or their legal repre-
sentatives shall appear before the ar-
bitration board.
For ensuring a better speed for set-
tling the collective disputes, Article
(129) obliges the arbitration board to
look into the dispute in a period not
later than twenty (20) days from the
date of arrival of its papers to the
Clerical Department; and either party
to the dispute should be notified of
the session date at least one week
prior to its holding; and the dispute
shall be decided on within a period
not exceeding three months from the
date of the first session for looking
into the dispute.

Article (130) provides that the arbi-
tration board shall have all the power
and authorities of the court of appeal
accordingto the provisions of the ju-
diciary organizing law and the Civil
& Commercial Procedures Code. The
arbitration shall issue justified and
causative decisions which shall be
the same as those decisions issued by
the court of appeal.

Article (131) has introduced a new
principle that the competent Ministry
may, in the event of collective dis-
pute and if the necessity so requires,
interfere without request by one of
the dispute parties to settle the dis-
pute amicably. Also, it may refer the
dispute to the reconciliation commit-
tee or arbitration board as it deems
appropriate, Also, this Article binds
both the parties to this dispute, in this
case, shall submit all the documents

|

 

79

required by the competent Ministry,
and they shall appear, if so sum-
moned, before the board.

Article 132 prohibits the parties of
the dispute to stop the work, totally

or partially, during the direct negotia-

tion proceedings or before the recon-

ciliation committee or the arbitration
board due to the interference of the
competent Ministry in the disputes

accordingto the provisions of the Ar-

ticle (131).

It goes without saying that the provi-
sions of this Section govern only the
continuous labour relations between
the parties of the dispute (the em-
ployer and labourers), otherwise, the
dispute will be deemed as personal
whatever the parties involved therein.

CHAPTER VI

LABOUR INSPECTION & PENAL-
TIES

SECTION I

LABOUR INSPECTION
Article (133) grants the authority of
Jegal and judicial capacity to the
competent employees to be identified
by the Minister by a decision to over-
sight and control the implementation
of this law and its executive rules,
regulations & decisions, provided
that those employees shall perform
their duties with due honesty, impar-

tiality and persistence and they shall

undertake not to disclose the secrets
of employers which they may have
access to by virtue of their work.
Also, they shall perform the neces-
sary legal oath before the Minister:
Article (134) specifies the powers
and authorities of those employees
and they shall have the right to enter
work places during the firm’s official
working hours, and to have access to
all books & records, and to request
such data & information related to la-
bour force affairs, Also, they shall
have the right in this connection to
check and take samples of the circu-
lated materials for analysis purpose;
and they shall further be entitled to
enter such places allocated by em-
ployers for labour services purposes,
and they may seek the assistance of

 

80

the public force for the execution of
the functions of their tasks.
Article (135) gives the official com-

' petent employees of the ministry the

right to take the necessary actions, in
coordination with the other compe-

tent authorities, to issue a decision on
the lockout of the business concern,
totally or partially, or to stop the use

of a certain machine(s) till the rectifi-

cation of such contravention.
Article 136 gives the official employ-
ees the authority to issue notices on
the committed contravention by the
labourers working without a specific
work center.

SECTION II
PENALTIES
This Section comprises Articles from
(137) to (142) in which we notice in
general that the legislator tends to-
wards hardening the punishments
against the violators to such an extent
which is harder than what was pre-
scribed in the Law No. (38) of 1964
after it became proven that those pen-
alties were not enough to prevent the
violators to commit such contraven-
tions.
Accordingly, Article (137) provides
for the punishment and penalty of not
more than KD 500/- applicable on

' whoever violates the provisions of
Articles (8, 35) herein; and in case of
repeating the same act, the penalty
shall be doubled.

Article (138) has introduced the pun-
ishment by imprisonment for not
more than three years and a fine not
more than KD 1,000/- or with both
penalties to be applicable on whoever
violates the provision of paragraph’
(3) of Article (10) of this law.
Article (139) provides for the penal
punishment against the employer
who will be in breach of the provi-
sions of Article (57) herein.
Also, the legislator, due to its belief
on the controlling role carried out by
the Ministry on the firms so as to
make sure to what extent they ob-
serve the rules, regulations and meas-
ures of occupational health & safety
as well as the Ministerial Decisions
issued for the implementation of the
same, it has stipulated in Article
(140) a penalty against whoever fails
to enable the competent employees
specified by the Minister to perform

 

their duties provided for in Articles
(133, 134) herein, shall be punished

_ by a fine not to exceed KD 1,000/-,

so as to confirm this principle.
Article (141) explains the method of
notification about the contravention
in order to remove the causes of vio-
lation and the prescribed punishment
thereof. Also, it prescribed a penalty
on whoever violates the remaining
provisions of this law and the execu-
tive decisions thereto.

In order to reactivate the Ministry
controlling role, Article (142) stipu-
lates that whoever violates the writ of
suspension or closure issued accor-
dingto the provisions of Article 135
herein without remedying the contra-
ventions notified to him by the com-
petent employees, shall be punished
by imprisonment for a period not ex-
ceeding six month and a fine not
more than KD 1000/-, or with one of
the two penalties.

CHAPTER VII
CONCLUDING PROVISIONS

This Chapter comprises Articles
from (143) to (150), where Article
(143) stipulates that a Consultant
Committee for Labour Affairs shall
be formed by a decision by the Min-
ister consisting of representatives of
the Ministry, Labour force Restruc-
turing & State Executive Body Pro-
gram, Employers & Labourers organ-
izations and whoever the Minister
deems appropriate, whose task is to
give opinion on the issues presented
to it by the Minister. This decision
shall also issue the necessary proce-
dures for inviting the committee for
meeting, work therein and how to is-
sue its recommendations.

The legislator, in order to strengthen
the protection of labourers and to en-
sure that they receive their labour
rights, he brought the provision of
Article (442) of the Civil Code, along
with all the warranties provided for
therein to the cases and lawsuits filed
by the labourers. This is contrary to
what was applicable in the light of
Article (96) of the Law No. 38 of
1964, where Article (144) of this law
stipulates that the actions filed by the
labourers under the provisions of this
law, after the lapse of one year from

 

82

T<

the employment contract expiry date
shall not be heard.

Upon denial, the provision of para-
graph (2) of Article (442) of the Civil
Code shall be applicable, where the
employer who sticks to not hearing
the lawsuit must give oath that he has
actually settled the debt to the labour-
er. If he is a heir or legal representa-
tive of the debtor or for his heirs, he
shall perform the oath that he has no
knowledge of such debt or he knows
that it has been settled. This oath
shall be taken by the court spontane-
ously without being demanded to do
$0.

Finally, the same Article provides in
its last paragraph that the actions
filed by labourers or their beneficiar-
ies shall be exempted from the judi-
cial fees. However, the court - upon
rejecting such actions — may bind the
party who files the case to pay all or
part of the expenses. Labour cases
shall be looked into forthwith on
prompt summary basis.
Article (145) of the law has intro-
duced a new provision which stipu-
lates that the rights of labourers pre-
scribed according to the provisions of
this law shall have preference & pri-

ority over all employers’ money, such
as movables & real estates, except
private residential dwellings. These
amounts shall be collected after the
legal expenses, the due amounts for
the public treasury, and document

keeping and repair costs.

Article (146) puts it as a pre-requisite
that a case should be preceded by an
application to be filed by the labourer
or his beneficiaries to the competent
labour department which shall sum-
mon the dispute parties or their repre-
sentatives to appear. If the depart-
ment could not reach an amicable
settlement, it shall refer the case,
within one month from the case sub-
mission date, to the Court of First In-
stance to decide on it. The referral
shall be made by a memorandum
comprising a summary of the dis-
pute, pleadings of both parties and
comments of the department.

According to the Article (147), the
Clerical Department at the Court of
First Instance shall, within 3 days
from the receipt of the application,

 

83

schedule a session for looking into
the case which shall be notified to
both parties of the dispute.
Article (148) stipulates that the Min-
ister shall issue the necessary rules,
regulations & decisions for imple-
menting this law within six months
from the date of publishing this law
in the Official Gazette, in consulta-
tion with employers and labours.
Article (149), after it has provided
for the cancellation of the Law No.
(38) of 1964 and the amending laws
thereto, this Article adds that the la-
bourers shall maintain all the rights
arising thereof before its cancella-
tion; and all the implementing deci-
sions thereof shall remain applicable
in such a manner which is not contra-
dictory to the provisions of this law
until the issue of the executive rules,
regulations, decisions and bylaws for
this law.

Finally, Article (150) requires the
Prime Minister and Ministers, each
within his jurisdiction, to implement
this law which shall be operative as
from the date of its publication in the
Official Gazette.
