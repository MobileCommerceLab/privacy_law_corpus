Law No. 17/2011
of 28th of December
LEGAL REGIME COVERING
THE PREVENTION OF AND
COMBAT AGAINST MONEY
LAUNDERING AND FINANCING
OF TERRORISM
Motives:
In the last two decades, money
laundering and related crimes, among
which, drug trafficking, corruption,
abduction and terrorism have become
crimes whose impact can no longer be
measured only at a local scale. If in
the past this practice was limited to
certain regions, its pernicious effects
now reach beyond national borders,
thus promoting instability in financial
systems and compromising economic
activities.
There are no doubts that money
laundering is a growing global threat
and that the measures to control this
problem have become the target of a
huge international effort. During the
last ten years, numerous States and
international organisations have been
involved in the struggle against money
laundering and the financing of
terrorism, by promoting national and
international cooperation to ensure
that financial institutions and nonfinancial
professions
take
the
necessary measures to mitigate the
damaging effects of this criminal
practice.
The Democratic Republic of TimorLeste cannot ignore this great
international effort, give that money
laundering and financing of terrorism,
besides permitting that, among others,
traffickers, arms smugglers, terrorists
or corrupt public servants ,continue
with their criminal activities, thus

facilitating access to illegal profits,
and that they may stain the reputation
of national financial institutions and, if
not controlled, undermine public trust
in the integrity of the national
financial system, thus jeopardising the
actual democratic Rule of Law.
In this framework, the Democratic
Republic of Timor-Leste wishes to
create
normative
instruments
appropriate to guarantee that there is
constant surveillance by the regulatory
bodies, banks, financial centres and
other vulnerable institutions to prevent
money laundering and financing of
terrorism from compromising the
stability and integrity of the financial
system and/or the trust of Timorese
institutions.
Therefore, the National Parliament
hereby, under the terms of no. 1 of
Article 95 of the Constitution of the
Republic, decrees that the following
prevail as law:
