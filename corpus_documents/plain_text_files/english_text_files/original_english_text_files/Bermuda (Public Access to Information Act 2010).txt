request.

8

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010
(6) The head of the public authority that first received the request shall inform the
requester in writing of the other public authority or authorities to whom a copy of the
request has been given.
(7) A public authority to whom a copy of a request has been given under subsection
(5) shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have received the request at the time of
the receipt by that authority of the copy, and subsections (4), (5) and (6) shall apply in
respect of the request that has been copied to the authority.
Decision on request
14
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a public authority shall, not later than 28
days after receipt, or deemed receipt, of a request under section 13, decide—
(a) whether to grant or refuse to grant the request in whole or in part; and

interest taken into consideration for the purposes of the decision; and

review of the decision has expired without an application having been made.
(4) Where an application has been made under section 41 for a review of a decision
to grant a request, the public authority concerned shall provide access to the record

completed.
Extension of time
15
(1) A public authority may extend the original period of 28 days referred to in
section 14(1) by such further period, not exceeding 28 days, as the authority considers
necessary if, in the opinion of the head of the authority, compliance with the original period
of 28 days is not reasonably practicable because—

9

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010
(a) there is insufficient time to consider representations made by third parties
under section 39 or to complete any consultations with regard to whether
access to particular information is in the public interest; or
(b) dealing with the request within the original period of 28 days would
substantially or unreasonably interfere with the day to day operations of
the authority.
(2) Where a period is extended by a public authority under this section, the
authority shall, before the expiration of the original period, give notice in writing to the
requester concerned of the extension and the reasons for it.
Refusal of request on administrative grounds
16
(1) A public authority may refuse to grant a request if—
(a) the record requested does not exist or cannot be found after all reasonable
steps have been taken to find it;
(b) the request does not contain sufficient information to enable the authority
to identify the record by taking reasonable steps;
(c) in the opinion of the head of the authority, granting the request would, by
reason of the number or nature of the records requested, require the
retrieval and examination of such number of records or an examination of
records of such kind as to cause a substantial and unreasonable
interference with or disruption of the other work of the public authority;
(d) publication of the record is required by law and is intended to be effected
not later than three months after the receipt of the request by the authority;
(e) the request is, in the opinion of the head of the authority, frivolous or
vexatious;

public or is reasonably available to the public on request under any other
statutory provision, whether free of charge or on payment; or
(g) the fee payable under section 20 has not been paid.
(2) A public authority shall not refuse to grant a request under subsection (1)(b)
or (c), unless the authority has assisted, or offered to assist, the requester to amend the
request in a manner such that it no longer falls under those provisions.
Manner of access to records
17
(1) A public authority shall give access to a record under this Act by providing the
requester with the information in the record in any of the following forms or manners that
it considers appropriate—
(a) a reasonable opportunity to inspect the record;
(b) a copy of the record;

10

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010

or another code;
(g) such other means as may be determined by the public authority.
(2) Where a public authority decides to grant a request and the request is for
access to a record in a particular form or manner, access shall be given in that form or
manner unless the authority is satisfied that—
(a) access in another form or manner specified in subsection (1) would be
significantly more efficient; or
(b) the giving of access in the form or manner requested would—
(i) be physically detrimental to the record,
(ii) involve an infringement of copyright (other than copyright owned by the
Crown, the Government or the public authority concerned),
(iii) conflict with a legal duty or obligation of the public authority concerned,
or
(iv) affect the protection of an exempt record from disclosure.
(3) Where a public authority decides to grant a request but, for reasons set out in
subsection (2), does not give access to the record requested in the form or manner specified
in the request, the authority shall give access in such form or manner as the authority
considers appropriate.
Access to part of record
18
(1) Subject to subsection (2), where a record requested contains information that
constitutes an exempt record, the public authority concerned shall, if it is practicable,
prepare a copy, in such form as the authority considers appropriate, of so much of the
record requested as does not consist of that material, and the request shall be granted by
offering the requester access to the copy in accordance with section 17.
(2) A public authority is not required to prepare a copy of a record under
subsection (1) if the copy would be misleading.
(3) Where a requester is offered access to a copy of part of a record under this
section, the notice under section 14 shall specify that such access is offered pursuant to
this section and that the copy does not purport to be a copy of the complete record
requested.

11

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010

behalf of the person to whom the information relates, amend the record—
(a) by altering it so as to make the information complete or correct or not
misleading, as the case may be;

information is incomplete, incorrect or misleading; or
(c) by deleting information from the record.
(2) A request under subsection (1) shall, so far as is practicable—
(a) specify the record concerned and the amendment requested; and
(b) include appropriate information in support of the request.
(3) The public authority concerned shall, within five working days after receipt of
a request, acknowledge receipt of the request and shall, within 28 days after receipt of the
request, decide whether to grant or refuse to grant the request and shall give notice, in
writing or in such other form as may be determined, of the decision of the authority to the
person concerned.
(4) A public authority may extend the original period of 28 days by such further
period, not exceeding 28 days, as the authority considers necessary if, in the opinion of the
head of the authority, compliance with the original period of 28 days is not reasonably
practicable.
(5) Where a period is extended by a public authority under subsection (4), the
authority shall, before the expiration of the original period, give notice in writing to the
requester concerned of the extension and the reasons for it.
(6) A notice referred to in subsection (3) shall—

(b) if the decision is to grant the request, specify the manner in which the
record concerned is to be amended; and
(c) indicate the provisions of this Act regarding review or appeal of a decision
under this section.
(7) If requested to do so by the requester, a public authority shall provide the
requester with evidence that the record has been amended by permitting the requester to
view the amended record or by giving the requester a copy of the amended record.
(8) No fee is payable in respect of a request under this section.

12

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010

to a record.
(3) Access to a record under this Act shall not be provided until any fee in respect
of the provision of access has been paid.
PART 4
EXEMPT RECORDS
Public interest test
For the purposes of this Part, the test of whether disclosure by a public authority
21
of a record or the existence of a record is in the public interest is whether the public interest
would, on balance, be better served by disclosure than by non-disclosure.
Health or safety of individual
22
(1) Subject to subsection (2), a record is exempt from disclosure if its disclosure
would, or would be likely to, endanger the physical or mental health or the safety of an
individual.
(2) A record shall be disclosed if disclosure of it is in the public interest.
Personal information
23
(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a record that consists of personal
information is exempt from disclosure.
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply if—
(a) subject to subsection (3), the information concerned relates to the
requester;
(b) the individual to whom the information relates consents in writing to its
disclosure;
(c) the information in the record is of the same kind as information that—
(i) is contained in the record in respect of individuals generally, or in
respect of a class of individuals that is of significant size, and
(ii) is available to the general public;
(d) the information was given to the public authority concerned by the
individual to whom it relates and the individual was informed on behalf of
the authority, before the information was given, that the information

13

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010
belonged to a class of information that would or might be made available
to the general public; or
(e) disclosure of the information is necessary in order to avoid a serious and
imminent danger to the life or health of an individual.
(3) Where disclosure of the information to the requester might be prejudicial to the
physical or mental health of the requester, a public authority may refuse a request for—
(a) a record of a medical or psychiatric nature relating to the requester; or
(b) a record kept for the purposes of, or obtained in the course of, the carrying
out of social work in relation to the requester.
(4) Where, under subsection (3), a public authority refuses to grant a request, the
authority shall, if requested to do so by the requester, provide access to a record referred
to in that subsection to a health professional, within the meaning of section 2 of the
Bermuda Health Council Act 2004, who has expertise in relation to the subject matter of
the record.
(5) A public authority may grant a request for a record containing personal
information in relation to an individual where the requester concerned is—
(a) the parent or guardian of the individual, if the individual is under the age
of eighteen; or
(b) the executor or administrator of the estate of the individual.
(6) A record that contains personal information relating to an individual shall be
disclosed if disclosure of it is in the public interest or would benefit the individual.

in any form about an identifiable individual, including—
(a) information relating to the race, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, sex

(c) any identifying number or other particular assigned to the individual;
(d) the address, fingerprints or blood type of the individual;
(e) the name of the individual where it appears with other personal
information relating to the individual or where the disclosure of the name
itself would reveal information about the individual;
(f) correspondence sent to a public authority by the individual that is
explicitly or implicitly of a private or confidential nature, and replies to
such correspondence that would reveal the contents of the original
correspondence; or

14

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010

of information that would or might be made available to the general public.

15

PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 2010
(i) that is given to a public authority by a third party (other than another
