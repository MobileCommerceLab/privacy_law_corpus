Introduction
The banking industry has changed the way of providing services to their customers
and processing of information in recent years. Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) has brought this momentous transformation. Electronic banking is
becoming more popular and enhancing the adoption of financial inclusion. Security
of Information for financial institutions has therefore gained much importance and it
is vital for us to ensure that the risks are properly identified and managed.
Moreover, information and information technology systems are essential assets for
the Banks and Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) as well as for their customers
and stakeholders. Information assets are critical to the services provided by the
Banks and NBFIs to their customers. Protection and maintenance of these assets are
important to the organizations’ sustainability. Banks and NBFIs must take the
responsibility of protecting the information from unauthorized access, modification,
disclosure and destruction. Approaches of Banks and NBFIs for business leading to
services are risk-based, which means ICT risk is also associated with banking system
that needs to be managed with thoughts and efforts.
This revised version of Guideline on ICT Security for Banks and NBFIs is to be used as
a minimum requirement and as appropriate to the level of technology adoption of
their operations.

1.1

Objectives
This Guideline defines minimum control requirements to which each Bank or NBFI
must adhere. The primary objectives of the Guideline are:
a) To establish a standard ICT Security Policy and ICT Security Management
approach
b) To help the Banks and NBFIs for secured setup of its ICT infrastructure
c) To establish a secured environment for the processing of data
d) To establish a holistic approach for ICT Risk management
e) To establish a procedure for Business Impact Analysis in conjunction with
ICT Risk Management
f) To aware stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities for the protection of
information
g) To prioritize information and ICT systems and associated risks those need to
be mitigated
h) To establish appropriate project management approach for ICT projects

i) To aware and train the users associated with ICT activities for achieving the
business objectives
j) To define procedure for periodic review of the policy

k) To ensure the best practices (industry standard) of the usage of technology
that is not limited to this guideline
l) To analyze security risks against faster adoption of Bring-Your-Own-Devices
(BYOD)
m) To minimize security risks for electronic banking infrastructure including
ATM and POS devices, payment cards, internet banking, mobile financial
services, etc.

1.2

Applicability of the Guideline
This ICT Security Guideline is a systematic approach of controls to policies required
to be formulated for ensuring security of information and ICT systems. This Guideline
covers all information that are electronically generated, received, stored, replicated,
printed, scanned and manually prepared. The provisions of this Guideline are
applicable for:
a) Banks and NBFIs for all of their Information Systems.
b) All activities and operations required to ensure data security including
facility design, physical security, application security, network security, ICT
risk

management,

project

management,

infrastructure

security

management, service delivery management, disaster recovery and business
continuity management, alternative delivery channels management,
acquisition and development of information systems, usage of hardware
and software, disposal policy and protection of copyrights and other
intellectual property rights.

1.3

Categorization of Banks and NBFIs
Depending on the architecture of core business application solution, ICT
infrastructure, operational environment and procedures, a Bank or NBFI can be
categorized as follows:
Category-1:

Centralized ICT Operation for managing core business application
solution through Data Center (DC) with backup assets for continuation
of critical services including Disaster Recovery Site (DRS)/Secondary
Data Center to which all other offices, branches and booths are
connected through WAN with 24x7 hours attended operation.

ICT Risk Management
ICT risk is a component of the overall risk universe of an enterprise. Other risks Bank
or NBFI faces include strategic risk, environmental risk, market risk, credit risk,
operational risk, compliance risk, etc. In many enterprises, ICT related risk is
considered to be a component of operational risk. However, even strategic risk can
have an ICT component itself, especially where ICT is the key enabler of new
business initiatives. The same applies for credit risk, where poor ICT security can lead
to lower credit ratings. It is better not to depict ICT risk with a hierarchic dependency
on one of the other risk categories.
ICT risk is business risk - specifically, the business risk associated with the use,
ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of ICT within a Bank or
NBFI. It consists of ICT related events and conditions that could potentially impact
the business. It can occur with both uncertain frequency and magnitude and it
creates challenges in meeting strategic goals and objectives.

3.1
3.1.1

ICT Risk Governance
The Bank or NBFI shall form an ICT Risk Management Committee to govern
overall ICT risks and relevant mitigation measures.

3.1.2

The Bank or NBFI shall define the Risk Appetite (amount of risk the Bank or NBFI
is prepared to accept to achieve its’ objectives) in terms of combinations of
frequency and magnitude of a risk to absorb loss e.g., financial loss, reputation
damage.

3.1.3

The Bank or NBFI shall define the Risk Tolerance (tolerable deviation from the
level set by the risk appetite definition) having approval from the board/Risk
Management Committee and clearly communicated to all stakeholders.

3.1.4

The Bank or NBFI shall review and approve risk appetite and tolerance change
over time; especially for new technology, new organizational structure, new
business strategy and other factors require the enterprise to reassess its risk
portfolio at a regular interval.

3.1.5

The Bank or NBFI shall define the risk responsibilities to individuals for ensuring
successful completion.

3.1.6

The Bank or NBFI shall define the risk accountability applies to those who owned
the required resources and have the authority to approve the execution and/or
accept the outcome of an activity within specific ICT Risk processes. Ownership

Bangladesh Bank

Page 9

Guideline on ICT Security For Banks and NBFIs

2015

of risk stays with owner or custodian whoever is in better position to mitigate the
identified risk for that specific ICT asset.

3.1.7

The Bank or NBFI shall acknowledge all risks by Risk Awareness so that those are
well understood and known and recognized as the means to manage them.

3.1.8

The Bank or NBFI shall contribute to executive management’s understanding of
the actual exposure to ICT risk by Open Communication, enabling definition of
appropriate and informed risk responses.

3.1.9

The Bank or NBFI shall aware amongst all internal stakeholders of the importance
of integrating risk and opportunity in their daily duties.

3.1.10

The Bank or NBFI shall be transparent to external stakeholders regarding the
actual level of risk and risk management processes in use.

The Bank or NBFI shall begin Risk-aware Culture from the top with board and
executives, who set direction, communicate risk-aware decision making and
reward effective risk management behaviors.

3.1.12

ICT security department/unit/cell shall report status of identified ICT security risk
to the ICT security committee and Risk Management Committee periodically as
defined in the policy.

3.2

ICT Risk Assessment
Meaningful ICT risk assessments and risk-based decisions require ICT risks to be
expressed in unambiguous and clear, business-relevant terms. Effective risk
management requires mutual understanding between ICT and the business over
which risk needs to be managed. All stakeholders must have the ability to
understand and express how adverse events may affect business objectives.
a) An ICT person shall understand how ICT-related failures or events can
impact enterprise objectives and cause direct or indirect loss to the
enterprise.
b) A business person shall understand how ICT-related failures or events can
affect key services and processes.

3.2.1

The Bank or NBFI shall establish business impact analysis needs to understand
the effects of adverse events. Bank or NBFI may practice several techniques and
options that can help them to describe ICT risks in business terms.

3.2.2

The Bank or NBFI shall practice the development and use of Risk Scenarios
technique to identify the important and relevant risks amongst all. The
developed risk scenarios can be used during risk analysis where frequency and
impact of the scenario are assessed.

Bangladesh Bank

Page 10

Guideline on ICT Security For Banks and NBFIs

3.2.3

2015

The Bank or NBFI shall define Risk Factors those influence the frequency and/or
business impact of risk scenarios.

3.2.4

The Bank or NBFI shall interpret risk factors as casual factors of the scenario that
is materializing, or as vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

3.2.5

ICT security department/unit/cell shall conduct periodic ICT risk assessment of
ICT related assets (process and system) and provide recommendation to risk
owners for mitigation.

3.3

ICT Risk Response
Risk response is to bring measured risk in line with the defined risk tolerance level
for the organization. In other words, a response needs to be defined such that as
much future residual risk as possible (usually depending on budgets available) falls
within risk tolerance limits. When the analysis shows risks deviating from the defined
tolerance levels, a response needs to be defined. This response can be any of the
four possible ways such as Risk Avoidance, Risk Reduction/Mitigation, Risk
Sharing/Transfer and Risk Acceptance.

3.3.1

The Bank or NBFI shall develop a set of metrics to serve as risk indicators.
Indicators for risks with high business impact are most likely to be Key Risk
Indicators (KRIs).

3.3.2

The Bank or NBFI shall give effort to implement, measure and report different
indicators that are equivalent in sensitivity.

3.3.3

Selection of the right set of KRIs, Bank or NBFI shall carry out:
a) Provide an early warning for a high risk to take proactive action
b) Provide a backward-looking view on risk events that have occurred
c) Enable the documentation and analysis of trends
d) Provide an indication of the risk’s appetite and tolerance through metric
setting
e) Increase the likelihood of achieving the strategic objectives
f) Assist in continually optimizing the risk governance and management
environment

3.3.4

The Bank or NBFI shall define risk response to bring risk in line with the defined
risk appetite for the Bank or NBFI after risk analysis.

3.3.5

The Bank or NBFI shall strengthen overall ICT risk management practices with
sufficient risk management processes.

3.3.6

The Bank or NBFI shall introduce a number of control measures intended to
reduce either of an adverse event and/or the business impact of an event.

Alternative Delivery Channels (ADC) Security Management
“Channelize through channels” is the new paradigm for banking today, which in
earlier relied solely on the branch network. Branchless banking is a distribution
channel strategy used for delivering financial services without relying on bank
branches. Alternate Delivery Channels are methods for providing banking services
directly to the customers. Customers can perform banking transactions through their
ATM, contact the bank’s Call Center for any inquiry, access the digital Interactive
Voice Response (IVR), perform transactions through Internet Banking and even on
phones through mobile banking, etc. These channels have enabled banks to reach a
wide consumer-base regardless of time and geographic location. ADCs ensure higher
customer satisfaction at lower operational expenses and transaction costs.

9.1

ATM/POS Transactions
The ATMs and Point-of-Sale (POS) devices have facilitated cardholders with the
convenience of withdrawing cash as well as making payments to merchants and
billing organizations. However, these systems are targets where card skimming
attacks are perpetrated. To secure consumer confidence in using these systems, the
Bank or NBFI shall consider putting in place the following measures to counteract
fraudsters’ attacks on ATMs and POS devices:

Customer Education
With the advent of electronic banking, customer’s experience of banking is therefore
no longer fully under control of a Bank or NBFI. In the age of self-service banking
model, a customer also has to be equipped to do safe banking through self help. It is
often said that the best defense against frauds is awareness of customer. With
fraudsters constantly creating more diverse and complex fraudulent ruses using
advanced technology and social engineering techniques to access their victims’
accounts, accelerating awareness among consumers becomes imperative.
It is also important to educate other stakeholders, including bank employees, who
can then act as resource persons for customer queries, law enforcement personnel
for more understanding response to customer complaints and media for
dissemination of accurate and timely information.

11.1 Awareness Program
Awareness programs can be successful only if users feel the content is in their
interest and is relevant to their banking needs. For fruitful awareness program to be
arranged, the bank needs to identify personnel, awareness material, advertisements
and promotions and maintenance of website.
11.1.1

The needs of the target audience shall be identified, appropriate budgets
obtained and priorities established.

11.1.2

The work plan shall clearly mention the main activities with the required
resources, timelines and milestones.

11.1.3

The Bank or NBFI shall create and publish proper contents.

11.1.4

The common objectives of the awareness program will be to:
a) Provide general and specific information about fraud risk trends, types or
controls to people who need to know.
b) Help consumers to identify areas vulnerable to fraud attempts and make
them aware of their responsibilities in relation to fraud prevention.
c) Motivate individuals to adopt recommended guidelines or practices.
d) Create a stronger culture of security with better understanding and
commitment.
e) Help minimize the number and extent of incidents, thus reducing costs
directly (fraud losses) and indirectly (reduced need to investigate).
