(3)

Subrules 13(2)(b) and (3) do not apply to unique identifiers assigned before 30 June

However, subrule 13(2) applies to the assignment of a unique identifier—

on or after 1 July 1993 under subrule 13(2)(a); and

(b)

on or after 30 June 1998 under subrule 13(2)(b);

5

Rule modifying the application of information privacy principle 13
Information privacy principle 13 is modified in accordance with the Act by the
following rule which applies to the justice sector agencies referred to in clause 4(1)—
Rule 13
Unique Identifiers

(1)

A justice sector agency (A) may assign a unique identifier to an individual for use in
its operations only if that identifier is necessary to enable A to carry out 1 or more of
its functions efficiently.

(2)

A may not assign to an individual a unique identifier that, to A’s knowledge, is the
same unique identifier as has been assigned to that individual by another justice sector
agency (B), unless—
(a)

the unique identifier is to be used by A for statistical or research purposes and
no other purpose; or

(b)

subrule (3) applies.

(3)

A may assign to an individual being processed through the justice system a unique
identifier previously assigned by B in the circumstances set out in Schedule 1.

(4)

To avoid doubt, A does not assign a unique identifier to an individual under subrule
(1) by simply recording a unique identifier assigned to the individual by B for the sole
purpose of communicating with B about the individual.

(5)

A justice sector agency that assigns unique identifiers to individuals must take any
steps that are reasonable to ensure that—

(6)

(a)

a unique identifier is assigned only to an individual whose identity is clearly
established; and

(b)

the risk of misuse of a unique identifier by any person is minimised (for
example, by showing truncated account numbers on receipts or in
correspondence).

A justice sector agency may not require an individual to disclose any unique identifier
assigned to that individual unless the disclosure is for one of the purposes in
connection with which that unique identifier was assigned or is for a purpose that is
directly related to one of those purposes.
