may have an interest in the currency.

(3)

Any person notiﬁed under subsection (2) and any other
person who claims to have an interest in the seized currency
are entitled to appear and to give evidence at the hearing
of the application, but the absence of a person does not
prevent the court from making a forfeiture order.

Upon hearing an application pursuant to subsection (1) and
upon being satisﬁed that the seized currency is:
(a)

the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity;
or

(b)

PART IVB
CIVIL FORFEITURE
Civil forfeiture orders

20A. (1)

If a freeze order is in force under Part IV, the Supervisory
Authority may apply to the High Court for a civil forfeiture
order forfeiting to the Crown all or any of the interests in
property that are subject to the freeze order when the
forfeiture order takes effect.

(2)

The High Court shall make a civil forfeiture order if the Court
ﬁnds that it is more probable than not that the person (in
this section called the “defendant”) in respect of whom the
freeze order was made had, at any time, not more than six
(6) years before the making of the application for the civil
forfeiture order, engaged in money laundering activity.

(3)

A ﬁnding of the High Court for the purposes of subsection
(2) need not be based on a ﬁnding as to commission of a
particular offence, and can be based on a ﬁnding that some
offence or other constituting a money laundering activity was
committed.

(4)

When a civil forfeiture order is made pursuant to this section
it must be made in respect of speciﬁed interests in property.

(5)

The reference in subsection (2) to a period of six (6) years
includes a reference to a period that began before the
commencement of this section.

(6)

The quashing or setting aside of a conviction for a money

PART IVB - CIVIL FORFEITURE
Section 20A(6)

Money Laundering (Prevention) Act 1996

laundering offence does not affect the validity of a civil
forfeiture order based on the same conduct that was made
before or after the conviction was quashed or set aside.

Application
for civil proceeds assessment order

(7)

The making of a civil forfeiture order under this section does
not prevent the making of a civil proceeds assessment order
which assesses the value of the proceeds of the money
laundering activity on which the civil forfeiture order is based.

(8)

The Supervisory Authority shall, in accordance with the
manner prescribed in section 28D, give at least fourteen
days notice of an application made under this section to the
defendant and to any other person he has reason to believe
may have interest in the property subject to the application.

(9)

Any person notiﬁed of an application pursuant to this section
is entitled to appear and give evidence at the hearing of
the application, but the failure or absence of that person to
appear and give evidence does not prevent the court from
making an order under subsection (2).

20B. (1)

The Supervisory Authority may apply to the High Court for
a civil proceeds assessment order requiring a person (in
this section called the “defendant”) to pay to the Crown an
amount assessed by the High Court as the value of the
beneﬁt he derived from the money laundering activities that
took place not more than six months before the making of
the application for the order.

(2)

The High Court must make a civil proceeds assessment
order if the Court ﬁnds it to be more probable than not that
the defendant was, at any time not more than six (6) years
before the making of the application for the order, engaged
in a money laundering activity from which a beneﬁt was
derived.

(3)

For the purposes of subsection (2) a ﬁnding by the High
Court does not need to be based on the commission of a
particular offence; but may be based on a ﬁnding that the
defendant had engaged in any money laundering activity.

(4)

The reference in subsection (2) to a period of six (6) years
includes a reference to a period that began before the
commencement of this section.

(5)

In making a ﬁnding under this section, the High Court shall

Matters to be
considered
in making an
order under
section 20B

(6)

The validity of a civil proceeds assessment order is not
affected by the quashing or setting aside of a conviction
based upon the same money laundering activity upon which
the civil proceeds assessment order was made.

(7)

The making of a civil proceeds assessment order under this
section does not prevent the making of a civil forfeiture order
based on the same money laundering activity upon which
the civil proceeds assessment order was made.

(8)

The Supervisory Authority shall, in accordance with the
manner prescribed in section 28D, give at least fourteen
days notice of an application made pursuant to this section
to the defendant and to any other person the Supervisory
Authority has reason to believe may have interest in the
property.

(9)

Any person notiﬁed of an application pursuant to this section
is entitled to appear and give evidence at the hearing of
the application, but the failure or absence of that person to
appear and give evidence does not prevent the court from
making an order under subsection (2).

(10)

A civil proceeds assessment order is a debt payable by the
defendant to the Crown and is recoverable as such.

(11)

If an order under this section is made against a dead
person, subsection (10) has effect before the ﬁnal
distribution of the estate as if the person had died the day
after the making of the order.

(12)

The amount recovered under a civil proceeds assessment
order is to be processed in accordance with section 20D.

(13)

The High Court may, at the time it makes a civil proceeds
assessment order or at any later time, make any ancillary
orders that the Court may consider appropriate.

20C. (1)

For the purpose of making a civil proceeds assessment
order under section 20B in relation to a person in this
section referred to as (“the defendant”), the High Court shall
have regard to the following matters—
(a)

the money, or the value of any interest in
property other than money, directly or indirectly

(i)

the defendant; or

(b)

the value of any service, beneﬁt or advantage
provided for—
(i)

the defendant; or

(ii)

another person at the request, or by
the direction, of the defendant,

as a result of the money laundering activity;
(c)

the value of the defendant’s property before and
after the money laundering activity;

(d)

the defendant’s income and expenditure before
and after the money laundering activity.

(2)

If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a civil
proceeds assessment order that the value of the defendant’s
property after a money laundering activity or money
laundering activities exceeded the value of the defendant’s
property before the activity or activities, the High Court is
to treat the excess as proceeds derived by the defendant
from the money laundering activity or activities, except to the
extent (if any) that the High Court is satisﬁed the excess was
due to causes unrelated to the money laundering activity or
activities.

(3)

If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a civil
proceeds assessment order of the amount of the defendant’s
expenditure during the period of six years before the making
of the application for the order, the High Court is to treat any
such amount as proceeds derived by the defendant from the
money laundering activity or activities, except to the extent
(if any) that the High Court is satisﬁed the expenditure was
from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to any
money laundering activity or activities.

(4)

The High Court is not to take expenditure into account under
subsection (3) to the extent that the Court is satisﬁed that it

In making an assessment as provided by this section the
High Court shall make no allowance for the following—
(a)

expenses or outgoings incurred by the
defendant in relation to the money laundering
activity or activities;

(b)

the value of any proceeds derived as agent for
or otherwise on behalf of some other person
