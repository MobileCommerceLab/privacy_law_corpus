liability on any share in respect of capital
which is not paid up (and for the purposes
hereof a rounding down in accordance with the
lex monetae or in accordance with the

Reduction of member liability a distribution.
308.

(1)

If a company proposes to alter its memorandum or articles, or

to acquire shares issued by it, or to redeem shares, in a manner which would cancel
or reduce the liability of a shareholder to the company in relation to a share held by

reduction of liability is to be treated –
(a)

for the purposes of section 303 as a distribution, and

(b)

for the purposes of section 304(4) and (5) as a
dividend.

(2)

If a company has altered its memorandum or articles, or

acquired shares, or redeemed shares, in a manner which cancels or reduces the
liability of a shareholder to the company in relation to a share held prior to that
alteration, acquisition or redemption, that cancellation or reduction of liability is to
be treated for the purposes of section 309 as a distribution of the amount by which
that liability was reduced.

(a)

greater than the liability of that shareholder to the
amalgamated body corporate in relation to a share or
shares into which that share is converted, or

(b)

cancelled by the cancellation of that share in the
amalgamation,

the reduction of liability effected by the amalgamation is to be treated for the

corporate to that shareholder, whether or not that shareholder becomes a
shareholder of the amalgamated body corporate, of the amount by which that
liability was reduced.
Recovery of distributions.
309.

(1)

A distribution made to a member at a time when the company

did not, immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test may be
recovered by the company from the member except to the extent that –
(a)

the member received the distribution in good faith and
without knowledge of the company's failure to satisfy
the solvency test,

(b)

the member has altered his position in reliance on the
validity of the distribution, and

(c)

it would be unfair to require payment in full or at all.

If, in relation to a distribution made to members –

the procedure set out in section 303, section 304,
sections 310 to 325 or sections 329 to 335 has not
been followed, or

may be),

is personally liable to the company to repay to the company so much of the
distribution as is not able to be recovered from members.
(3)

If a distribution is deemed not to have been authorised, a

director who –
(a)

ceased after authorisation but before the making of the
distribution to be satisfied on reasonable grounds for
believing that the company would satisfy the solvency
test immediately after the distribution is made, and

(b)

failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the
distribution being made,

is personally liable to the company to repay to the company so much of the
distribution as is not able to be recovered from members.
(4)

If, by virtue of section 307(5), a distribution is deemed not to

have been authorised, a director who failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the
distribution being made is personally liable to the company to repay to the company
so much of the distribution as is not able to be recovered from members.

© States of Guernsey

If, in an action brought against a director or member under

371

of a lesser amount, have satisfied the solvency test, the Court may –
(a)

permit the member to retain, or

(b)

relieve the director from liability in respect of,

an amount equal to the value of any distribution that could properly have been
made.

ranking ahead of those in respect of which a
