§6101. Findings
The Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Telemarketing differs from other sales activities in that it can be carried out by sellers across State lines without direct contact with the consumer. Telemarketers also can be very mobile, easily moving from State to State.
(2) Interstate telemarketing fraud has become a problem of such magnitude that the resources of the Federal Trade Commission are not sufficient to ensure adequate consumer protection from such fraud.
(3) Consumers and others are estimated to lose $40 billion a year in telemarketing fraud.
(4) Consumers are victimized by other forms of telemarketing deception and abuse.
(5) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation that will offer consumers necessary protection from telemarketing deception and abuse.

Congressional Findings
Pub. L. 106–534, §2, Nov. 22, 2000, 114 Stat. 2555, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
"(1) Older Americans are among the most rapidly growing segments of our society.
"(2) Our Nation's elderly are too frequently the victims of violent crime, property crime, and consumer and telemarketing fraud.
"(3) The elderly are often targeted and retargeted in a range of fraudulent schemes.
"(4) The TRIAD program, originally sponsored by the National Sheriffs' Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the American Association of Retired Persons unites sheriffs, police chiefs, senior volunteers, elder care providers, families, and seniors to reduce the criminal victimization of the elderly.
"(5) Congress should continue to support TRIAD and similar community partnerships that improve the safety and quality of life for millions of senior citizens.
"(6) There are few other community-based efforts that forge partnerships to coordinate criminal justice and social service resources to improve the safety and security of the elderly.
"(7) According to the National Consumers League, telemarketing fraud costs consumers nearly $40,000,000,000 each year.
"(8) Senior citizens are often the target of telemarketing fraud.
"(9) Fraudulent telemarketers compile the names of consumers who are potentially vulnerable to telemarketing fraud into the so-called 'mooch lists'.
"(10) It is estimated that 56 percent of the names on such 'mooch lists' are individuals age 50 or older.
"(11) The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Trade Commission have provided resources to assist private-sector organizations to operate outreach programs to warn senior citizens whose names appear on confiscated 'mooch lists'.
"(12) The Administration on Aging was formed, in part, to provide senior citizens with the resources, information, and assistance their special circumstances require.
"(13) The Administration on Aging has a system in place to inform senior citizens of the dangers of telemarketing fraud.
"(14) Senior citizens need to be warned of the dangers of telemarketing fraud before they become victims of such fraud."

"(b) Comptroller General.—The Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the TRIAD program 180 days prior to the expiration of the authorization under this Act [see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note above], including an analysis of TRIAD programs and activities; identification of impediments to the establishment of TRIADs across the Nation; and recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the TRIAD program."

"(5) inform senior citizens how to report suspected attempts at or acts of fraud;
"(6) inform senior citizens of their consumer protection rights under Federal law; and
"(7) provide such other information as the Secretary considers necessary to protect senior citizens against fraudulent telemarketing and sweepstakes promotions.
"(c) Means of Dissemination.—The Secretary shall determine the means to disseminate information under this section. In making such determination, the Secretary shall consider—
"(1) public service announcements;
"(2) a printed manual or pamphlet;
"(3) an Internet website;
