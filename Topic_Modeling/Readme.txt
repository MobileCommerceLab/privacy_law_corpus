Order of Running the Code:
---------------------------

1. First run the File-Chunking.py code on the files in the corpus. A new set of files will be generated and will be saved into the path you have given
2. Run the NLTK code now, with the .txt files generated in the previous step as input files
3. Run the NLTK-Clean.py code on the NLTK output file. The topics will be formatted neatly, and will be written into a .txt file



NLTK Topic modeling code:

1. Will take in .txt files as inputs 
2. Will generate Topics as outputs and will write them into a .txt file
3. Will also generate an interactive html report to analyze the:
    i) 30 most relevant terms for each of the topics generated by 
       the NLTK Code
   ii) Intertopic Distance Map

Required Packages: NLTK, Gensim, pyLDAvis, pickle, OS


To change the following before executing the code:
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Change the variables p1 and p2 to redirect to the correct path of the Native English Documents and Translated English Documents 

2.  Change the parameters in the lda_model variable under LDA code to get different outputs. (The below line of code is the one that must be changed)
[lda_model = gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus=corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=num_topics, passes=9, update_every=2)]

3. Change the path in the "LDAvis_data_filepath" variable under the report generation code to that of your local system. The same change must also be done in the pyLDAvis.save_html() function
