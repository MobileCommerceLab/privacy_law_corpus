NLTK Topic modeling code:

1. Will take in .txt files as inputs 
2. Will generate Topics as outputs and will write them into a .txt file
3. Will also generate an interactive html report to analyze the:
    i) 30 most relevant terms for each of the topics generated by 
       the NLTK Code
   ii) Intertopic Distance Map

Required Packages: NLTK, Gensim, pyLDAvis, pickle, OS


To change the following before executing the code:
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Change the variables p1 and p2 to redirect to the correct path of the Native English Documents and Translated English Documents 

2.  Change the parameters in the lda_model variable under LDA code to get different outputs. (The below line of code is the one that must be changed)
[lda_model = gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus=corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=num_topics, passes=9, update_every=2)]

3. Change the path in the "LDAvis_data_filepath" variable under the report generation code to that of your local system. The same change must also be done in the pyLDAvis.save_html() function
