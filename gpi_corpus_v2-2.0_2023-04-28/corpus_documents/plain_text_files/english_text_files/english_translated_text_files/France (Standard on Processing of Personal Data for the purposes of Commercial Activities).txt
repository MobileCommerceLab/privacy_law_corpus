1.
WHO Is THIS REPOSITORY ?

This repository oversees the implementation by organizations of private or public law, of their
files "customers" and " prospects ".
Given the particular nature of their activities, this repository does not apply to treatments
work by :
the health facilities or education ;
the banking establishments, or similar ;
insurance companies ;
the operators subject to the approval of the regulatory Authority of online games.

2.
SCOPE OF THE REPOSITORY

The treatments implemented for the purposes of managing business activities, whether they are implemented from
internal tools or outsourced to a service provider, lead to collect data relating
to individuals (customers, prospects, suppliers, and any person likely to be in a relationship
contract with the organization in the context of the management of its commercial activity). As such, they are subject
to the provisions of the RGPD), law of 6 January 1978, as amended, as well as to the specific provisions relating to

the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.
The organizations involved, as controllers, must implement all the measures
technical and organisational measures to ensure a high level of data protection as
personal as the design of treatment and throughout the life of the latter. They must, furthermore, be
able to demonstrate compliance at any time. The treatments implemented must be entered in the
register provided for in article 30 of the RGPD (
see models register on the site cnil.fr
).
The application of this standard allows us to ensure treatment compliance management
trade in the light of the principles relating to the protection of data.
It is also an aid to the completion of an analysis of impact relative to the protection
data (AIPD) in cases where it is necessary. The organizations will be able to define
their measures to ensure the proportionality and the necessity of their treatment
(points 3 to 7), to guarantee the rights of persons (points 8 and 9) and control their risks
(item 10). To this end, the agency can refer the guidelines of the CNIL on the
impact analysis relating to the protection of data.

3.
OBJECTIVE(S) PURSUED(S) BY THE TREATMENT (PURPOSES)

Treatment management of business operations can be implemented for the following purposes :
(a)
contract management (e.g. : management of orders, the delivery, the execution of the service
or the supply of goods, invoices, and payments) ;
(b)
management of loyalty programmes ;
(c)
bookkeeping general and auxiliary accounting methods that can be

3
The information collected for these purposes may not be re-used to pursue another
goal, which would be incompatible with the original purpose. Out of any new use of the data must observe
the principles of protection of personal data. The processes used must not give rise
to interconnections or exchanges other than those necessary to the accomplishment of the purposes above
set forth.
Because the more sensitive, this repository is not intended to frame the following treatments :
- the detection and prevention of fraud ;
- the exclusion of temporary or permanent people the benefit of the provision of services or the
provision of a property (for example, because of unpaid, to incivility from customers or conduct that is
abusive). These objectives are framed by the repository XXXX ;
- the profiling of people. For what concerns the tracking of their navigation, the organization that wants to put
implementation of such treatment shall comply with the deliberation nÂ° 2013-378 of 5 December 2013
on the adoption of a recommendation on the cookies and other tracers covered by the article 32-II
of the law of 6 January 1978 and may refer to the dedicated section on the website of the CNIL ;
- the monitoring of attendance and of course customers in physical stores ;
- the enrichment of databases from information collected by third parties.

4.
BASE(S) LEGAL(S) OF TREATMENT

Each purpose of the processing must be based on a legal basis laid down by the regulation. The different
foundations, allowing an organisation to process personal data are listed below.
(a)
the consent is free, specific, informed and unambiguous of the person concerned ;
The consent to be valid, requires positive action and specific to the person concerned (e.g. :
a check box dedicated, non-pre-checked). Acceptance of terms and conditions of use, may not be enough :
the agreement must be free and not influenced or forced (he may not condition the purchase of a service or
the purchase of a property, the creation of an online account for access to a service, etc.).
(b)
the execution, or of a contract to which the person concerned is a partyor of measures
pre-contractual taken at his request. The data collected must be necessary for the execution of
contractual and/or pre-contractual ;
(c)
to respect a legal obligation to the organization ;and
(d)
the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the organization or by the recipient of the
data, provided that it does not recognise the interest or rights and freedoms
the fundamental of the person concerned.
A table, below, illustrates through practical examples, the cases in which the legal bases can be
selected on the basis of the objective pursued by the processing.
The legal basis should be brought to the attention of the persons whose data are being processed as they
allow, in particular, to determine their rights.

5.
PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED

In an effort minimization of personal data processed, the organization should ensure that it does collect and
use the data which is relevant and necessary in the light of its own needs in terms of management of the activities
of business. This may include data relating to :

4
(a)
the identification of the person concerned ;
The internal code used to identify it in the database may not be his credit card number,
social security or identity.
If the organization shall verify the identity of a person before entering into business relations with it, the
simple presentation of a proof may be sufficient. A copy of this proof can be kept for a period
of 6 years when the law so provides or if the organization can justify the need to pre-establish an evidence in
case of litigation. In this case, of the enhanced security measures, such as, for example, the limitation of the
quality of the scanned image, or the integration of a watermark with the date of collection and the identity of
the body, must be implemented in order to combat the risk of misuse of such information, in
particular the use of the photographs for facial recognition.

(b)
the professional life (for example, to the management of supplier contracts) ;
(c)
the means of payment used (see also point 7) ;
(d)
the transaction and the goods or services you have purchased (data related to the settlement of bills, in the
monitoring of the business relationship, notices, left, claims management, etc) ;
(e)
the family situation, economic and financial information of the person or persons involved in the
transaction when such data are linked to the business relationship.
Exceptionally, for example if the information is necessary for the purpose of the
treatment and if you have an appropriate legal basis, certain information known as " sensitive "
(which may, in particular, revealing political opinions, religious or philosophical orientation,
sexual or information on the health of the person concerned) may be collected.

A table, below, lists the data that can be collected and processed according to the purposes of the processing.
After being assured of the necessity and the relevance of the personal data that it uses, the agency must
also ensure, throughout the lifetime of the treatment, the quality of the data it processes. This means
in practice that, in accordance with the regulation, the data accurate and up-to-date.

6.
THE RECIPIENTS OF THE INFORMATION

The personal data must only be made accessible to the persons entitled to know
in the light of their duties.
The access right must be documented by the organizations, and the access to the different treatments
should be subject to measures of traceability. See point 9 on the security.

In case of using a sub-contractor, the contract with the agency must make mention of obligations
obligations regarding data protection (article 28 of the RGPD). The
Guide sub-contractor
ished by the
CNIL specifies the obligations and the clauses included in the contracts.
The transmission of personal data to commercial partners requires, upstream :
- to inform the persons concerned on the support of data collection (online form, or
paper form) the purpose of this transmission, and categories of recipients concerned. The
specific list of recipients must be regularly updated and made available to persons
from the same media (for example, by including a hyperlink) ;
- collect the consent (see section 4.(a) persons when these business partners

publ

have a calling to do their own marketing by electronic means (for text messages,
e-mails, faxes, or automatic calling machines). The consent of the individuals collected for this purpose must be
maintained for purposes of proof ;
- allow people to oppose it when the exploration is carried out by post or by the
through a phone call.
5
Data designated as " sensitive ", as referred to in point 5 may be passed on to third parties.
To ensure the continuity of the protection of personal data, the transfers of these
outside the european Union are subject to special rules. Thus, any transmission of data outside
of the EU must :
- be based on a decision of adequacy ; or
- to be framed by binding corporate rules, model clauses, data protection, a code
of conduct or a certification mechanism approved by the CNIL ; or
- to be governed by contractual terms ad hoc pre-authorized by the CNIL ; or
- respond to one of the derogations provided for in article 49 of the RGPD.

7.
TIMES OF CONSERVATION

A shelf-life of certain should be fixed according to each purpose. In any case, the data
must not be stored for an indefinite period of time.
E.g. : the security code of the credit card should be removed as soon as the payment for the service or
the purchase was made. In contrast, the number of a payment card may be kept to allow for
future purchases under the conditions laid down by the
recommendation on the processing of the card
payment terms of the sale of goods or supply of services at a distance
.
The data necessary for the performance of a contract are kept for the duration of the contractual relationship.
They can also be kept :
for a period of 3 years from the last contact that the persons to which they relate
have been with the organization (e.g., for customers, a purchase or the date of expiration of a guarantee, warranty, or for
the prospects, with a click on a hyperlink in an email) ;
after the execution of the contract, in filing intermediary, if the controller has the obligation
by law (for example, to meet obligations, accounting or tax) or if he wants to
be used as an evidence in case of litigation and in the limit of the applicable limitation period.
For the commercial activities that involve the creation, by the customers themselves, an online account (for
example, online dating sites or social networking), the data are intended to be retained until the
deletion of the account by the user. However, it is common that users no longer use these accounts
are not clear, which leads to sustained indefinitely. In this case, a reasonable period of time (e.g. :
2 years) should be determined, after which the accounts are to be classified as inactive. It should then
notify the affected users, and to delete accounts of those who have not responded within the time limit
set by the organization.
When a person exercises his right of objection to receive from prospecting, to ensure
its effectiveness, the information allowing to take into account this law shall be kept for at least
3 years. These data may in no case be used for purposes other than the management of the right of opposition, and
only the data necessary to take into account the right of objection must be preserved (e.g. :
e-mail address).
For more information, you can refer to the guides of the CNIL :
-"
Safety : Archive in a secure manner
"
;
- " Limit the retention of data ".
The data is used for statistical purposes only are more qualified of personal data when
they have been duly anonymized (
See the guidelines of the article 29 working party on the anonymisation
).
