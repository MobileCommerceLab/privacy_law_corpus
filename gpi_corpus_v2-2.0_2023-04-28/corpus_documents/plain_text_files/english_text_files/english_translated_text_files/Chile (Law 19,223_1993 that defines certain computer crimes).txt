TYPES CRIMINAL FIGURES RELATED TO COMPUTERS
Bearing in mind that the H. National Congress has approved the
following
Bill:

"Article 1 .- Anyone who maliciously destroys or disables a system of
processing of information or its parts or components, or prevents, hinders or
modify its operation, it will suffer the penalty of minor imprisonment in its medium degree to
maximum.
If as a consequence of these behaviors the data contained in the
system, the penalty indicated in the previous paragraph will be applied, in its maximum degree.

Article 2.- The one who with the intention of seizing, using or knowing improperly
of the information contained in a treatment system of the same, intercepts it,
interferes or accedes to it, will be punished with minor imprisonment in its minimum degree to
half.

Article 3.- Anyone who maliciously alters, damages or destroys the data
contained in an information processing system, will be punished with imprisonment
lower in its middle grade.

Article 4.- Anyone who maliciously reveals or disseminates the data contained in a
information system, will suffer the penalty of minor imprisonment in its medium degree. Yes
Whoever engages in these behaviors is responsible for the information system, the
penalty will be increased by one degree. ".

And since I have seen fit to approve and sanction it; therefore be enacted and
be put into effect as the Law of the Republic.
Santiago, May 28, 1993.- ENRIQUE KRAUSS RUSQUE, Vice President of the
Republic.- Francisco Cumplido Cereceda, Minister of Justice.
What I transcribe to you for your knowledge.- Kind regards to you, Martita
