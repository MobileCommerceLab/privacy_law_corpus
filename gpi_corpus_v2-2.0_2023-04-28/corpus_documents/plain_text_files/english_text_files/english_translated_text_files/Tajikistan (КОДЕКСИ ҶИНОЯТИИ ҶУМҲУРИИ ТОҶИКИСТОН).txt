NOTE:
1. The articles listed in Tables 2 and 3 are under national control (List 4
National List of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and Precursors by Government Resolution
Republic of Tajikistan № 390 as of 21.09.2000). Also, they (other than ephedra),
are subject to international supervision (see Tables I and II of the 1988 UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women)
fight against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances
are found). These articles are called "precursors" according to the legislation of the Republic of Tajikistan.
Precursors - articles in the relevant international conventions and national lists as a basis or
auxiliaries for the production, preparation and processing of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances
are grouped.
2. To the table 1 substances from which preparation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances
it is possible to include. To Table 2 items to prepare their means
Drugs and psychotropic substances are possible. In the definition
size of precursors recommendations, works and data materials of the International Control Committee
Precursors (Vienna, Austria), Committee on Combating Drug Abuse and Drug Abuse of the Ministry of Justice
Republic of Kazakhstan, Legislative and Regulatory Acts of the Organization of American States (OAS), Union
Europe (EU), Ukraine were used. Also, when calculating large and especially large sizes
precursors were used: M.D. Mashkovsky "Drugs", Issue. 2, Vol.1. - 14th ed.,
processing. ispr. and dop.- M .: LLC "New Wave" Publishing House, 2000.-540 p .; Precursors (reference manual), sostl Saidmuradov Sh.D., AKN., Izd-vo GP "Vostokredmet", 2001. 0 80 p .; "Collection of clinical guidance

3. When extracting liquid precursors, expressed in liters, transfer them to
solid substance to determine weight in kilograms, using the chemical formula “dense”
carry. Density is the mass (weight) of a substance in units of volume. Below is the density formula
will be:
Density (d) = mass (m)
volume (v)
Density is usually expressed in kg / l or g / l. For the sake of uniformity, in this classification all
densities are expressed in kg / l. Density formula for calculating the mass of a substance when determining
volume, or volume is used when determining weight. Below are examples of calculations
weight and volume are given by this formula:
A) If 2500 liters of methyl ethyl ketone are seized, what is its weight in kilograms (kg)?
how much is
M = d х v;
1. Find the density of methyl ethyl ketone. It was 0.81 kg / l.
2. 0.81 kg / l (d) multiplied by 2500 l. (v) approximately 2025 kg. (m) is equal to.
3. Thus, 2500 l. Methyl ethyl ketone 2025 kg. weighs. Below is the density of some precursors
(based on density data in the Merck Index, 11th edition, Merck and Co., Inc.,
United States Amerika, 1989, cited):

To determine the amounts of sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, the dimensions indicated
concentrated acids - 98% sulfuric acid and 38% hydrochloric acid. When
extraction of mixed solutions of these acids, determination of the percentage concentration of these
solutions and converting the amount of mixed acid into the amount of concentrated acid prepared for preparation.
of the same amount of mixed acid is required.
Example:
When extracting 100 liters of 25% sulfuric acid (acid density 1.18 kg / l), calculate
the amount of acid required in kg.

A is the amount of acid extracted in kg;

X = -----------; d is the density of the extracted acid in kg / l;

LAW OF THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN
About adoption of the Criminal code of the Republic of Tajikistan

Majlisi Oli of the Republic of Tajikistan decides:
1. To adopt the Criminal code of the Republic of Tajikistan.
2. The Criminal Code of the Republic of Tajikistan, enacted by the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan from August 17, 2006
1961 “On Ratification of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Tajikistan” was approved as well
all laws in the period from August 17, 1961 to May 21, 1998 to the Criminal Code
The Republic of Tajikistan has made changes and amendments since the day the new Code came into force
be considered invalid.
