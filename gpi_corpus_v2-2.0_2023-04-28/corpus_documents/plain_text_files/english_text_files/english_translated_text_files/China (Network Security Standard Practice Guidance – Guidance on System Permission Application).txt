3 Principles and requirements of permission application
3.1 Basic principles of permission application
a) Principle of Least Necessity: Only apply for permissions necessary for App business functions, do not apply
Permissions not related to App business functions.
b) User-knowable principle: all the permissions applied for should have clear and reasonable usage scenarios,
And inform the user of the purpose of the permission application.
c) The principle of non-mandatory and non-bundling: It should not be mandatory to apply for system permissions, and users should not be
Sub-authorization agrees to open multiple system permissions.
d) Dynamic application principle: The permissions required by the App should be moved when the corresponding business function is executed
State application. When the user does not trigger the relevant business function, do not apply in advance for the current business function
Can have nothing to do with permissions.
3.2 General requirements for permission application
a) The permission application should meet the "least necessary" principle, and the system has nothing to do with business functions
Permissions are not declared to the operating system, for example, irrelevant Android system permissions are not available
Declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
Note 1: The "Business Function Examples" in Table A.1 in Appendix A gives examples of business functions related to permissions.
Note 2: Appendix D shows the Android system permissions that are less relevant to common service types and are not recommended to apply for.

b) When applying for permission, the purpose of permission application should be notified simultaneously, and the purpose should be clear and easy to understand.
Does not contain advertisements and any description of fraud, deception, or misleading user authorization.
c) App (including the embedded SDK) to apply for the required permissions should be in the declaration file (such as
AndroidManifest.xml) strictly follow the format specification one by one.
d) If you only need to use part of the permissions in the permission group, you should not declare the same in the permission declaration file.
A permission group and other permissions, for example, when the App only needs to use the calendar write permission, it should not be
2

Page 8

The permission to read the calendar is declared in AndroidManifest.xml.
e) If the user refuses or withdraws the non-essential system permissions granted to a certain service type, the App should not
Forcibly quit or close, and does not affect the use of business functions unrelated to this authority.
Note: For the necessary system permissions of the service type, please refer to "Information Security Technology Mobile Internet Application (App)
The minimum necessary personal information for the common service types in the Basic Regulations for the Collection of Personal Information shall be judged.

f) If the user explicitly rejects the permissions required for the Appâ€™s business functions, the App should not frequently apply for the system
System authority interferes with the normal use of the user, unless the user actively triggers the function and does not have the authority
Participation in this business function cannot be achieved. "Frequent" forms include but are not limited to:
1) After the user denies permission for a single scene, a pop-up window prompts the user to open within 48 hours
The number of system permissions exceeds 1 time;
2) Every time you reopen the App or use a certain business function, you will be asked
Want or prompt the user for lack of relevant system permissions.
g) App should not collect unique devices that cannot be changed except only for safety and risk control scenarios
Identification code (such as IMEI, MAC address).
h) When identifying users in directional push and user portrait scenarios, a resettable logo should be used
Identifier, and the identifier is not the same as the unique device identification code that can identify the userâ€™s identity information or unchangeable
Associated.
i) If the permission required by the App business function is rejected by the user and the user chooses to prohibit it, it will not be mentioned again
It is indicated that when the user uses this function again, it should be in a way that does not interfere with the user (such as text prompts)
Guide the user to the system settings to enable the required permissions.
j) App should respect the user's permission settings, and should not deceive or force users to agree to unnecessary
If possible, it is advisable to provide alternative solutions for users who refuse to authorize.
Note: For example, if the user refuses the location permission in a non-navigation scenario, the function of manually entering the address can be provided.

Page 9

k) Apps with built-in third-party SDKs should require the SDK to expressly apply for the system rights to the App
Limit and application purpose.
l) App should review the application permission of the embedded third-party SDK to ensure its application
The requested authority corresponds to the business function scenario, and does not exceed the agreed scope.

4 Principles and requirements for the use of permissions
4.1 Basic principles for the use of permissions
a) Consistency principle: The use of permissions should be consistent with those described in the privacy policy when applying for permissions
The stated purposes, usage scenarios and rules are consistent.
b) The principle of non-proliferation: The data and capabilities obtained by the app through system permissions should not be
It is provided to the applet or other apps on the terminal without authorization by the user.
c) The principle of explicit access: use system permissions (such as camera, microphone, position
When obtaining personal sensitive information, users should be reminded in an explicit way to avoid using hidden information.
Ways to collect user personal information.
4.2 General requirements for the use of permissions
a) After the permission application is authorized, the App should only access the minimum that meets the needs of business functions
Personal information, for example, when reading the calendar, if you only need to read the schedule information for a certain date, you should not
Read the schedule of other dates.
b) The frequency of automatic collection of personal information after permission application should be in the realization of App business functions
The necessary minimum reasonable frequency range.
c) App should not change the system permission authorization status of its settings without the user's consent, such as
When the App is updated, the permissions set by the user are automatically restored to the default state.
d) If the purpose of system permission application and usage scenarios change, users should be notified again.
4

Page 10

e) When the external interface provided by the App involves personal information and the permissions defined by the operating system
When the purpose cannot be achieved, the App should access the external interaction of personal information through custom permissions
Set reasonable access permissions for the components.
f) App custom permissions should be defined and named strictly in accordance with the operating system permission requirements, and ensure
Ensure completeness, clarity, and accuracy, and configure reasonable protection levels for permissions.
g) The following operations should be actively triggered by the user and executed under the knowledge of the user:
1) Perform operations such as making phone calls and sending text messages;
2) Turn on or off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc.;
3) Shooting, recording, screenshots, screen recordings, etc.;
4) Read and write personal information such as user text messages and contacts.
h) Personal information should not be collected concealedly. When recording, shooting, screen recording, positioning and other sensitive functions
When it can be executed in the background, significant methods (such as flashing icons, prompts in the status bar, customized
Prompts, etc.) to prompt the user.
i) It should not be read and uploaded in a concealed manner without the userâ€™s knowledge or authorization.
Pass the personal information contained in the clipboard and the personal information in the public storage area.
j) If the operating system supports it, the App can collect personal information when applying for camera, location, microphone, etc.
The authority of sensitive information should provide users with the option of temporary single authorization.
k) For apps that provide mini programs to access the platform, the mini programs should be required to explain their application to the access platform.
Please request the system permissions and application purpose.
l) The app that provides the mini program access platform should provide the function of rights management for the mini program,
Mini Programs should allow users to close or revoke authorization for Mini Programs to collect personal information.
