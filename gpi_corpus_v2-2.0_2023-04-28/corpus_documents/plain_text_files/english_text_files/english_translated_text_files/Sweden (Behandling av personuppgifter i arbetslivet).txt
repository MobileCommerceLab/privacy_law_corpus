Who is responsible for the treatment of
personal information?
The Data Protection Regulation does not normally require permission from the IMY
to process personal data. Exceptions may apply to camera surveillance
in some cases, or in the case of criminal information. Instead, be responsible
the employer (the person responsible for personal data) for, and must be able to show, that
processing of employees' personal data is carried out in a lawful manner. It is
that is, the employer who is independently responsible and who decides on
what personal data may be collected and how they may be used. This
applies even if the personal data controller hires someone else to
process the personal data (a personal data assistant) for example a
supplier of an IT system. IMY is the supervisory authority and supervisor
application of the provisions.

Data protection officer at the workplace
Employers can appoint a data protection officer. In some cases it is a requirement.
The representative shall assist the employer in complying with the Data Protection Ordinance, to
example by giving advice and performing certain checks.
If the employer has appointed a data protection officer in his organization,
the employees get information about this. The employees can contact
the Data Protection Officer with questions concerning the employer's treatment of
their personal data and about their rights in the processing.
