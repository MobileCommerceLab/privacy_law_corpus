not merely as a general crime , but as an offense
complaint. The affirmation of the complaint offense is intended to be in line with the
the principle of legal certainty and a sense of community justice.
Based on the Constitutional Court Decision Number s/PUU-Vfil I 2OLO,

The Constitutional Court is of the opinion that the activities and authorities
wiretapping is a very sensitive matter because on the one hand
is a limitation of human rights, but on the other hand it has aspects
legal interests . Therefore , the setting (regutation) regarding

the legality of wiretapping should be formed and formulated in precise accordance
with the Constitution of the State of the Republic of Indonesia Year 1945. In
In addition, the Court is of the opinion that because wiretapping is a
violation of human rights as affirmed in Article

carried out legally, especially in the context of law enforcement . By
because of that, the Court in the verdict add words or
the phrase "in particular" to the phrase " Electronic Information and/or Documents
