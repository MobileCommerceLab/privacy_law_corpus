consideration in determining whether goods are like;

Page 2

1.The customs value of imported goods is their transaction value, i.e. the price actually paid or payable
for goods when sold for export to the customs territory, after adjustment made
in accordance with the provisions of article 68 below, provided:
(a) that there are no restrictions on the transfer or use of the goods by the buyer, other than restrictions which:
i. are imposed or required by law or by the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
ii. limit the geographical area in which the goods can be resold; or do not substantially affect the value
goods ;
b) that the sale or the price is not subject to conditions or services the value of which cannot be determined
relates to the goods to be valued;
c) that no part of the proceeds from any resale, assignment or subsequent use of the goods by the purchaser is returned directly
or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made under the provisions of article 68 below; and
d) that the buyer and seller are unrelated or, if they are, the transaction value is acceptable for customs purposes in
under the provisions of point 2 below.
2.
a) In order to determine whether the transaction value is acceptable for the purposes of applying the provisions of point 1 above, the fact that
the buyer and seller are related does not in itself constitute sufficient grounds for considering the transaction value as
unacceptable. In such a case, the specific circumstances of the sale are examined, and the transaction value accepted provided that
these links did not influence the price. If, taking into account the information provided by the declarant or obtained from other sources, Customs
has reasons to consider that the links influenced the price, it communicates its reasons to the declarant and gives him a possibility
reasonable to answer. If the declarant so requests, the reasons are communicated to him in writing.
b) In a sale between related parties, the transaction value is accepted and the goods are valued in accordance with
provisions of point 1 above when the declarant demonstrates that said value is very close to one of the values âindicated below,
occurring at the same time or at about the same time:
i. transaction value in sales, to unrelated buyers, of identical or similar goods for export to
destination of the Democratic Republic of Congo;
ii. customs value of identical or similar goods, as determined by applying the provisions of Article 65
below ;
iii. customs value of identical or similar goods, as determined by applying the provisions of Article 66
below.
In applying the above criteria, due account shall be taken of the differences demonstrated between levels of trade,
quantities, the elements listed in article 68 below, and the costs borne by the seller during sales in which the
seller and buyer are not related and that he does not support in sales in which seller and buyer are related.
c) The criteria set in point b) are to be used at the initiative of the registrant, and for comparison purposes only. Values âof
substitution cannot be established under point (b).
Article 62:
1.
a) If the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined by application of the provisions of Article 61 below
above, the customs value is the transaction value of identical goods sold for export to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and exported at or around the same time as the goods to be valued.
b) When applying the provisions of this article, the customs value is determined by reference to the transaction value
identical goods, sold at the same commercial level and substantially in the same quantity as the goods to be valued.
In the absence of such sales, we refer to the transaction value of identical goods, sold on a commercial level.
different and / or in different quantity, adjusted to take account of the differences that the commercial level and / or the quantity may have
result, provided that such adjustments, whether they lead to an increase or decrease in value, can be
be based on evidence produced which clearly establishes that it is reasonable and correct.
2.When the costs and charges referred to in point 2 of article 68 below are included in the transaction value, this value is
adjusted to take account of the significant differences that may exist between the costs and costs relating to, on the one hand, the goods
imported, and on the other hand to the identical goods considered, as a result of differences in distances and modes of
transport.
3.If, during the application of this article, more than one transaction value of identical goods is established, reference is made to
the lowest transaction value to determine the customs value of imported goods.
Article 63:
1.
a) If the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined by application of the provisions of Articles 61 and 62
above, the customs value is the transaction value of similar goods sold for export to the United States.
Democratic Republic of the Congo and exported at or around the same time as the goods to be valued.
b) When applying the provisions of this article, the customs value is determined by reference to the transaction value
like goods, sold at the same level of trade and substantially in the same quantity as the goods to be valued.
In the absence of such sales, we refer to the transaction value of similar goods, sold on a commercial level.
different and / or in different quantity, adjusted to take account of the differences that the commercial level and / or the quantity may have
result, provided that such adjustments, whether they lead to an increase or decrease in value, can be
be based on evidence produced which clearly establishes that it is reasonable and correct.
2.When the costs and charges referred to in point 2 of article 68 below are included in the transaction value, this value is
adjusted to take account of the significant differences that may exist between the costs and costs relating to, on the one hand, the goods
imported, and on the other hand to the like goods concerned, owing to differences in distances and modes of
transport.
3.If, during the application of the provisions of this article, more than one transaction value of similar goods is established,
the lowest transaction value is used to determine the customs value of imported goods.

iv. import duties and taxes and other taxes payable in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by reason of importation or sale
goods.
(b) If neither the imported goods nor identical or similar imported goods are sold at or about
at the time of importation of the goods to be valued, the customs value is based, subject otherwise to the provisions of
point
a), on the unit price at which the imported goods, or identical or similar imported goods, are sold in
Democratic Republic of the Congo in the state in which they are imported, on the earliest date following the importation of the goods to
evaluate, but within 90 days of this import.
2.If neither the imported goods nor identical or similar imported goods are sold in the Republic

value added by working or processing and deductions provided for in point 1 a) above.

authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the agreement of the producer and on condition that sufficient notice is given to the
government of the country concerned and that the latter does not oppose the investigation.
Article 67:
1.If the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined by applying the provisions of Articles 61 to 66
above, it is determined by reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of the
the World Trade Organization (WTO) on customs valuation and Article VII of the General Agreement on Trade and
Customs tariffs (GATT) of 1994 and on the basis of data available in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
