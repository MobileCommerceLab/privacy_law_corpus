Having regard to the proposal of the Technical Pharmaceutical Council,
released March 23, 2017;
Considering that no advice has been formulated by the Medical Evaluation and
Control Service within the period of five days stated in Article 27, paragraph 4, of
the law on compulsory insurance for medical care and benefits, coordinated on 14
July 1994, and whereas the advice in question is therefore deemed to have been
given in application of that legal provision;

Considering that the Medical Assessment and Control Service did not issue an
opinion within the five-day period provided for in Article 27, paragraph 4, of the law
'relating to compulsory health care insurance and indemnities', coordinated on 14
July 1994, and that the opinion concerned is therefore deemed to have been given

the Council of State on February 11, 2019, in application of Article 84, § 1, first
paragraph, 2° of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on January 12, 1973;

Considering the absence of communication of the notice within this period;

Whereas the opinion has not been communicated within that period; Considering
that account has been taken of the fact that sterile compresses have a social
importance and offer a wider range of dressings and that there is no budgetary
impact since the insurance contribution will be made on the basis of an already
existing lump sum; that a common CAT code has been assigned; whereas the
entry of compresses in Chapter VI is therefore justified; Considering that DL-alphatocopheryl hydrogen succinate is no longer available on the market, that alternatives
are reimbursable and
available, that it was considered that the raw material mentioned above should
no longer be included in the list of reimbursable raw materials, that the decision to
remove them so seems justified.

Considering that it is taken into account that sterile compresses have a social
interest and offer a wider range of dressings and that it was considered that there
was no budgetary impact, because the intervention insurance will be based on a
pre-existing package, that a common CAT code has been assigned; that the
inclusion of compresses in Chapter VI is therefore justified;

Considering that DL-alphatocopheryl (hydrogen succinate) is no longer available
on the market, that alternatives are reimbursable and available, that it has been
considered that the raw material mentioned above should no longer be included in

2019; Considering that the Government intends to make this Order retroactive to September 1 , 2018;
Considering that the retroactivity of administrative acts is allowed when it is necessary for the continuity of the public
service and the regularization of a factual or legal situation, provided that it respects the requirements of legal certainty and the individual
rights; Considering the urgency of solving the labor shortages encountered in Wallonia (more than

200,000 job seekers and 88 professions deemed to be in short supply) and in line with the federal Jobs Deal; Considering that the list of
trades in shortage is published by Forem each year, in June; Considering that the majority of training courses eligible for the financial
incentive and in particular those organized by the IFAPME network start in September; Considering that, in its opinion delivered on September
24, 2018, the Economic and Social Council of

By judgment of 21 February 2019, the expedition of which was received at the registry of the Court on 4 March 2019,
the Antwerp Commercial Court, Antwerp division, has asked the following question for a preliminary ruling:
« Does Article III.26, § 2 [of the Code of Economic Law] violate Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution, in that it provides that
the inadmissibility it establishes is covered if it is not used by the defendant(s) for any other objection or defense is invoked and
this would imply that the court should not be allowed to invoke this admissibility [read: inadmissibility], which is dictated as a
sanction mechanism for non-compliance with fiscal and social law inspection options, while the defendants against whom a claim
is directed which should be declared inadmissible for another reason of public order, can enjoy the advantage that the court can
raise this inadmissibility ex officio? ».

effectively benefit from the fact that the judge can raise automatically this inadmissibility? ".
