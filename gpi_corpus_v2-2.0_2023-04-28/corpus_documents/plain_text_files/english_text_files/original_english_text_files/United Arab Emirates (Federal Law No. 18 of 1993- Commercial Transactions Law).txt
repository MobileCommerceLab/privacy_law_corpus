establishments shall have to comply with such rules.
Article 33

peruse these books, personally or through an expert appointed by it to this effect.

any evidence in his favor may not fractionalize the data entered therein.
2- The data duly entered in the commercial books according to the law provisions shall constitute a proof in favor of the owner of these books against his opponent trader, unless they are challenged by the latter
on account of data duly entered in his books according to the law provisions or by any other means proving that they are not true.
3- In the event where both litigants' commercial books are regularly kept according to the law provisions and the comparison mode between them shows a contradiction in the data entered therein, the court
must ask for another evidence.

regular books shall prevail, unless the opponent submits proof to the contrary. The same provision shall apply if one of the litigants submits regular books and the other do not submit any.
Article 37
Should one of the two merchant opponents rely for the validity of his claim on the other opponent's commercial books, and should he admit in advance the correctness of the data entered therein while the
former refrains without justification from producing such books to the court for perusal; this shall be deemed a presumption that the facts required to be proved in the books are correct. The Court may further
administer suppletory oath to the Plaintiff as to the validity of his claim.

Article 64
A trader may not induce the employees or workers of another competitor trader, so that they assist him in usurping the customers of that other trader, or so that they leave their employer's service and enter into
his service or disclose to him the secrets of his competitor. These acts are considered as unfair competition calling for compensation.
Article 65
A trader may not propagate such matters as are inconsistent with reality regarding the origin or description of his goods, or any other matters pertaining to their nature or importance. Likewise, he may not

pledgeeâ€™s right, except where the item sold is indivisible.
Article 174
Where the market price of the pledged property decreases and becomes insufficient to secure the debt, the creditor may fix a suitable time limit for the debtor to complement the security. Should the pledgor
refuse to do so, or where the time limit expires and the pledgor fails to complement the security, the creditor may ask, even before the maturity date for the sale of the pledged property in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Article (172).
Article 175

agreed on such entry.

entered under separate sections with due regard to the similarity in the payments included therein and further provided that both parties declare that the account maintains its unity in spite of its several sections.

between the various sections to extract a single balance.
Article 399
1- Payments, made by the customer, into the current account shall not bear interest unless otherwise agreed upon. Interest shall be computed on basis of the rate agreed upon; where the rate of interest has not

open with its balance being carried forward to the same current account. The said account shall resume functioning on the next working day.
Article 402
Where the current account is closed, the debit balance is deemed a debt immediately due, unless both parties agree otherwise, or where some of the transactions that must be entered into the account are still in

body of creditors, in order to guarantee the eventual balance of the debt to the extent of the debit balance at the time when the mortgage is imposed.
2- Nevertheless, the mortgage may be opposed against the body of creditors, as to the difference-if any- between the debit balance at the time when the mortgage is decided and the balance at the time of closing

2- Should the drawee be declared bankrupt, whether he has accepted the bill of exchange or not, or in case of bankruptcy of the drawer of the bill of exchange who had stipulated its non-presentment for

concerns each endorser, start to run as from the date on which he received the notice from the preceding endorser.

4- Any person bound to serve a notice, may do so in any manner whatsoever, even by returning the bill of exchange itself.
5- The person bound to send a notice, must prove that he did so within the prescribed time limit prescribed. Such time limit shall be deemed to be observed if he delivers the registered letter containing the
notice to the Post Office within the said time limit.
6- The person bound to serve notice shall not forfeit his rights if he fails to do so within the prescribed time limit, but he shall be required-when relevant- to compensate the damage resulting from his

"recourse without costs" or "without protest" or any other stipulation having the same meaning and signed by him.
2- However, this stipulation shall neither exempt the bearer from presenting the bill of exchange within the prescribed time limits nor from serving the required notices. Any person opposing to the bearer the
non-observance of such time limits shall have to prove his allegation.
3- Where the drawer has stipulated the condition of "recourse without costs", the effects of such stipulation shall apply to all the signatories; however if such stipulation is made by an endorser or backer, its
effects shall apply to him alone.

Article 563
1- The bearer of a bill of exchange may claim, from the person having a right of recourse against him, the following:

Article 567
In case of recourse exercised after a partial acceptance, the person who has paid the non-accepted part of the value of the bill of exchange, may require its bearer to prove such payment of the bill itself and

b- Make a protest for non-acceptance or for non-payment.
c- Present the bill of exchange for payment in case it contains a stipulation of "recourse without costs".
2- Nevertheless, the drawer shall not benefit from such forfeiture, except where he proves that he made available the consideration for payment on the maturity date; in which case the bearer may only have
recourse against the drawee.
3- Where a bill of exchange is not presented for acceptance within the time limit set by the drawer, the bearer shall forfeit his right of recourse based on both the non-acceptance and non-payment, unless it is
revealed from the wording of the stipulation that the intention of the drawer thereby was to relieve himself from guaranteeing the acceptance.
4- Where the endorser stipulates in his endorsement a date for presentment of the bill of exchange for acceptance, he may alone take advantage of such stipulation.
Article 569
1- Where due to a force majeure a bill of exchange is not presented or protested within the prescribed time limits, such time limit shall be extended.
2- The bearer shall, without delay, notify his endorser of the force majeure; such notice dated and signed by the bearer shall be transcribed on the bill itself or its extension; such notices to be served by each
endorser to his previous endorser up to the drawer according to Article (560).
3- On cessation of the force majeure, the bearer shall without delay present the bill of exchange for acceptance or payment, then make the protest when necessary.
4- Where the force majeure continues for more than thirty days calculated as of the maturity date, recourse may be exercised against the obligors without the need to present the bill of exchange or make a
protest.

if such date is prior to the expiry of the time limits set for presentment of the bill of exchange. The sight period shall be added to the thirty day time limit, if the bill of exchange is due for payment at a certain
specified period after sight.
6- Matters related to the person of the bearer or any person delegated by him to present or protest the bill of exchange shall not be deemed to be a force majeure.
Article 570

obligors under the bill of exchange, subject to the provisions stipulated for such attachment in the Civil Procedures Code, except the production of a guarantee.
Article 571

from the place where the original bill of exchange was payable to the place of the guarantor's domicile.
4- Where the drawer of a recourse bill of exchange is an endorser, its amount shall be determined on the same basis as that adopted to fix the value of a bill of exchange due for payment at sight, drawn from the
place of the drawerâ€™s domicile to the place of the guarantor's domicile.
