Data Protection
(f)

section 49 sets out the sixth data protection principle
(requirement that personal data be processed in a secure
manner).

(2) In addition(a)

each of sections 44, 45, 47 and 48 makes provision to
supplement the principle to which it relates; and

(b)

sections 50 and 51 make provision about the safeguards that
apply in relation to certain types of processing.

(3) The controller in relation to personal data is responsible for, and must
be able to demonstrate, compliance with this Chapter.
The first data protection principle.
44.(1) The first data protection principle is that processing of personal data
for any of the law enforcement purposes must be lawful and fair.
(2) The processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement
purposes is lawful only if and to the extent that it is based on law and either(a)

the data subject has given consent to the processing for that
purpose; or

(b)

the processing is necessary for the performance of a task
carried out for that purpose by a competent authority.

(3) In addition, where the processing for any of the law enforcement
purposes is sensitive processing, the processing is permitted only in the
following two cases(a)

(b)

The first case is where(i)

the data subject has given consent to the processing for
the law enforcement purpose as mentioned in subsection
(2)(a), and

(ii)

at the time when the processing is carried out, the
controller has an appropriate policy document in place as
per section 51.

the second case is where(i)

the processing is strictly necessary for the law
enforcement purpose,

© Government of Gibraltar (www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi)

Data Protection
(ii)

the processing meets at least one of the conditions in
Schedule 8, and

(iii)

at the time when the processing is carried out, the
controller has an appropriate policy document in place as
per section 51.

(4) The Minister may by regulations amend Schedule 8 by(a)

adding conditions;

(b)

omitting conditions added by regulations under paragraph (a).

(5) In this section, “sensitive processing” means(a)

the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade
union membership;

(b)

the processing of genetic data, or of biometric data, for the
purpose of uniquely identifying an individual;

(c)

the processing of data concerning health;

(d)

the processing of data concerning an individual’s sex life or
sexual orientation.

The second data protection principle.
45.(1) The second data protection principle is that(a)

the law enforcement purpose for which personal data is
collected on any occasion must be specified, explicit and
legitimate; and

(b)

subject to subsections (2) and (3), personal data so collected
must not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with the
purpose for which it was collected.

(2) Personal data collected for a law enforcement purpose may be
processed for any other law enforcement purpose, whether by the controller
that collected the data or by another controller, provided that(a)

the controller is authorised by law to process the data for the
other purpose; and

© Government of Gibraltar (www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi)

2004-01

2004-01

Data Protection
(b)

the processing is necessary and proportionate to that other
purpose.

(3) Personal data collected for any of the law enforcement purposes may
not be processed for a purpose that is not a law enforcement purpose unless
the processing is authorised by law.
The third data protection principle.
46. The third data protection principle is that personal data processed for
any of the law enforcement purposes must be adequate, relevant and not
excessive in relation to the purpose for which it is processed.
The fourth data protection principle.
47.(1) The fourth data protection principle is that(a)

personal data processed for any of the law enforcement
purposes must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to
date; and

(b)

every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal
data that is inaccurate, having regard to the law enforcement
purpose for which it is processed, is erased or rectified without
delay.

(2) In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes,
personal data based on facts must, so far as possible, be distinguished from
personal data based on personal assessments.
(3) In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, a
clear distinction must, where relevant and as far as possible, be made
between personal data relating to different categories of data subject, such
as(a)

persons suspected of having committed or being about to
commit a criminal offence;

(b)

persons convicted of a criminal offence;

(c)

persons who are or may be victims of a criminal offence;

(d)

witnesses or other persons with information about offences.

(4) All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data which
is inaccurate, incomplete or no longer up to date is not transmitted or made
available for any of the law enforcement purposes.

© Government of Gibraltar (www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi)

Data Protection
(5) For that purpose(a)

the quality of personal data must be verified before it is
transmitted or made available;

(b)

in all transmissions of personal data, the necessary information
enabling the recipient to assess the degree of accuracy,
completeness and reliability of the data and the extent to which
it is up to date must be included; and

(c)

if, after personal data has been transmitted, it emerges that the
data was incorrect or that the transmission was unlawful, the
recipient must be notified without delay.

The fifth data protection principle.
48.(1) The fifth data protection principle is that personal data processed for
any of the law enforcement purposes must be kept for no longer than is
necessary for the purpose for which it is processed.
(2) Appropriate time limits must be established for the periodic review of
the need for the continued storage of personal data for any of the law
enforcement purposes.
The sixth data protection principle.
49. The sixth data protection principle is that personal data processed for
any of the law enforcement purposes must be so processed in a manner that
ensures appropriate security of the personal data, using appropriate technical
or organisational measures (and, in this principle, “appropriate security”
includes protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against
accidental loss, destruction or damage).
Safeguards: archiving.
50.(1) This section applies in relation to the processing of personal data for
a law enforcement purpose where the processing is necessary(a)

for archiving purposes in the public interest;

(b)

for scientific or historical research purposes; or

(c)

for statistical purposes.

(2) The processing is not permitted if-

(a)

it is carried out for the purposes of, or in connection with,
measures or decisions with respect to a particular data subject;
or

(b)

it is likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress to
a data subject.

Safeguards: sensitive processing.
51.(1) This section applies for the purposes of section 44(4) and (5), which
require a controller to have an appropriate policy document in place when
carrying out sensitive processing in reliance on the consent of the data
subject or, as the case may be, in reliance on a condition specified in
Schedule 8.
(2) The controller has an appropriate policy document in place in relation
to the sensitive processing if the controller has produced a document which(a)

explains the controller’s procedures for securing compliance
with the data protection principles (see section 43(1)) in
connection with sensitive processing in reliance on the consent
of the data subject or, as the case may be, in reliance on the
condition in question; and

(b)

explains the controller’s policies as regards the retention and
erasure of personal data processed in reliance on the consent of
the data subject or, as the case may be, in reliance on the
condition in question, giving an indication of how long such
personal data is likely to be retained.

(3) Where personal data is processed on the basis that an appropriate
policy document is in place, the controller must during the relevant period(a)

retain the appropriate policy document;

(b)

review and, if appropriate, update it from time to time; and

(c)

make it available to the Commissioner, on request, without
charge.

(4) The record maintained by the controller under section 70(1) and, where
the sensitive processing is carried out by a processor on behalf of the
controller, the record maintained by the processor under section 70(3) must
include the following information-

Data Protection
(a)

whether the sensitive processing is carried out in reliance on
the consent of the data subject or, if not, which condition in
Schedule 8 is relied on;

(b)

how the processing satisfies section 44 (lawfulness of
processing); and

(c)

whether the personal data is retained and erased in accordance
with the policies described in subsection (2)(b) and, if it is not,
the reasons for not following those policies.

(5) In this section, “relevant period”, in relation to sensitive processing in
reliance on the consent of the data subject or in reliance on a condition
specified in Schedule 8, means a period which(a)

begins when the controller starts to carry out the sensitive
processing in reliance on the data subject’s consent or, as the
case may be, in reliance on that condition; and

(b)

ends at the end of the period of 6 months beginning when the
controller ceases to carry out the processing.
