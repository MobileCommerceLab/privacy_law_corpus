business process as a trigger for certain operation authorization. For example, only after
receiving a customer complaint may a complaint-handler access relevant information of
such PI Subject.

7.2 Restrictions on display
9

Where display of PI on an interface (such as display screen and paper) is involved, the PI
Controller should take measures such as de-identification to process the to-be-displayed PI,
so as to reduce the risk of PI leakage during the display. For example, during the display of PI,
the PI Controller could prevent unauthorized accesses to the PI by unauthorized internal
personnel or by people other than the PI Subject.
7.3 Restrictions on the purpose of use
Requirements on PI Controllers include:
a) The use of PI shall not go beyond the scope directly or reasonably related to the
purposes declared for the collection of PI. When business needs require the use of PI
that exceeds the abovementioned scope, the PI Controller shall again seek explicit
consent from PI Subjects.
Note 1: Using the collected PI for academic research or making descriptions about the overall state of
nature, science, society and economy is within the scope reasonably related to the collection purpose.
However, when the academic research or description results are made available, the PI contained in the
results shall be de-identified.

b)

The information generated from the processing of collected PI, if able to, either
independently or in combination with other information, identify a particular natural
person or reflect the activity of a particular natural person, shall be deemed PI.
Processing of such information shall fall within the scope of consent obtained for the
collection of PI.
Note 2: If the PI generated from the processing falls within the category of sensitive PI, processing of
such information shall meet the requirements pertaining to sensitive PI.

7.4 Restrictions on the use of user profiling
Requirements on PI Controllers include:
a) In user profiling, the characteristic description of PI Subjects shall not:
1) Contain obscene, pornographic, gamble-related, superstitious, horrific or violent
contents;
2) Contain contents that discriminate against nations, ethnic groups, religions,
disabilities and diseases.
b) The use of user profiling in business operations or external business cooperation shall
not:
1) Infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons or other
organizations;
2) Jeopardize national security, national honor or interests, instigate the subversion of
state power or the overturn of the socialist system, incite secession of the country
or sabotage of national unity, advocate terrorism or extremism, propagate ethnic
hatred or ethnic discrimination, spread violent, obscene or pornographic
information, or fabricate or spread false information to disrupt the economic and
social order.
c) Unless necessary to achieving the purpose of use of PI consented to by PI Subjects, in
the use of PI, the explicit information that could point to the identity of a particular
individual shall be removed. For example, direct user profiling could be used for the
10

purpose of accurately evaluating the credit status of an individual, but for the purpose of
pushing commercial advertisements, indirect user profiling should be used.

Annex B
(Informative)
Identification of sensitive personal information
Sensitive PI refers to the information vital to personal interests, that once leaked, illegally
provided, or misused, may endanger personal and property safety, or easily lead to damage to
one’s personal reputation, mental & physical health, or discriminatory treatment. Generally,
the PI of children up to 14 years of age and the information involving a natural persons’
privacy fall within the category of sensitive PI. The following aspects should be considered
when determining whether a piece of information is sensitive PI:
Leakage: The leakage of PI will cause PI Subjects and the organizations collecting and using
PI to lose control over the PI, leading to uncontrollability over the spreading and use of the PI.
Some PI, once leaked, is used directly or analyzed in combination with other information
against the will of the PI Subjects, which may bring major risks to the rights and interests of
the PI Subjects. Such PI shall be determined as sensitive PI. For example, the photocopy of a
PI Subject’s ID card is used by people other than the PI Subject for real-name registration for
SIM cards and opening bank accounts.
Illegal provision: The information that, once spread beyond the scope of consent of the
Subjects, will bring major risks to the rights and interests of the Subjects, shall be determined
as sensitive PI. Such information includes sexual orientation, bank deposit information, and
history of contagious diseases.
Misuse: The information that, once used beyond the limit of the consented scope (e.g. change
of use purposes, expanded processing scope), may bring major risks to the rights and interests
of the PI Subjects, shall be determined as sensitive PI. For example, insurance companies use
personal health information for marketing purposes and to determine the premium level
without prior consent of the PI Subjects.
Table B.1 gives examples of sensitive PI.

Table B.1 Examples of sensitive personal information

Personal
property
information

Bank account, authentication information (password), bank deposit information
(including amount of funds, payment and collection records), real estate
information, credit records, credit information, transaction and consumption
records, bank statement, etc., and virtual property information such as virtual
currency, virtual transaction and game CD Keys.

Physiological and
health information

The records generated in connection with medical treatment, including
pathological information, hospitalization records, physician’s instructions, test
reports, surgical and anesthesia records, nursing records, medicine administration
records, drug and food allergy, fertility information, medical history, diagnosis and
treatment, family illness history, history of present illness, history of infection.

Personal biometric
information

Personal gene, fingerprint, voice print, palm print, auricle, iris, and facial
recognition features, etc.

Personal identity
information

ID card, military officer certificate, passport, driver’s license, employee ID, social
security card, resident certificate, etc.

Annex C
(Informative)
Methods to safeguard independent choice of personal information subject
C.1 Overview
Safeguarding the independent choice of PI Subjects includes two aspects: firstly, not force the
PI Subjects to accept multiple business functions, and secondly, guarantee the PI Subjects’
right to know about the collection and use of their PI and their right to give consent. PI
Controllers, especially operators of mobile-Internet applications (APPs), can do this through
the following ways:
C.2 Distinguish between basic business functions and extended business
functions
To ensure PI Subjects’ independent right to choose and give consent, PI Controllers shall
firstly draw a line between the basic business functions and extended business functions of a
product or service. Methods are as follows:
a)

The PI Controllers shall define the product or service’s basic business functions in
accordance with the fundamental expectations and the most important needs for the
products or service that is selected or used by the PI Subjects;
Note 1:

A PI Subject identifies or selects a product or service based primarily on such factors as the

marketing and business positioning of the product or service provided by the PI Controller, the name of
the product or service itself, the description in the app store, and the category of application. Therefore,
the PI Controller shall define the basic business functions based on the average PI Subjects’ most likely
knowledge and understanding of the above factors, rather than their own ideas to determine the PI
Subjects’ main needs and expectations. In general, basic business functions are those that if not
provided, the PI Subjects would not choose to use the product or service.
Note 2: As products or services iterate, expand and upgrade, their basic business functions may need to
be redefined. PI Controllers may still redefine the basic business functions based on the most likely
knowledge and understanding of average PI Subjects. However, the PI Controllers should not change
the demarcation between basic business functions and extended business functions on a large scale in a
short period of time. After redefinition, the PI Controllers should again inform the PI Subjects and
obtain their explicit consent regarding the collection and use of their PI for basic business functions;

b)

Improving service quality, enhancing PI Subjects’ experience, or the R&D of new
products shall not be deemed a separate basic business function;

c)

All the functions provided by the product or service other than the basic business
functions shall be defined as extended business functions.

C.3 Notification of basic business functions and explicit consent

29

Methods to deliver basic business function notification and obtain explicit consent are as
follows:
a)

PI Controllers shall, before the basic business functions are activated (such as the initial
installation, first use, and account registration by PI Subjects), inform the PI Subjects of
the types of PI necessary to be collected for basic business functions through an
interactive interface or design (such as pop-up windows, text descriptions, filling boxes,
tooltips, and warning tones), as well as the impact resulted if the PI Subject refuses to
provide or refuses to consent to the collection, and take the affirmative action of the PI
Subjects (such as tick or click “Agree” or “Next”) as explicit consent to the collection；
Note 1:

When the basic business functions provided by a product or service do not need to be

activated all at once, they should be gradually activated in accordance with the specific use behavior of
the PI Subject, and the notification requirements in a) should be completed immediately.

b)
c)

When a PI Subject rejects the collection of PI necessary for basic business functions, the
PI Controller may refuse to provide the business functions to the PI Subject；
The interactive interface or design required in C.3 a) shall make it convenient for PI
Subjects to re-access and change the scope of the consent.
Note 2: See Annex C.5 for the implementation of the requirements above.

C.4 Notification of extended business functions and explicit consent
Methods to deliver extended business function notification and obtain explicit consent are as
follows:
a) PI Controllers shall, before extended business functions are used for the first time,
inform individual PI Subjects of the extended business functions and the types of PI
necessary to be collected, through an interactive interface or design (such as pop-up
windows, text descriptions, filling boxes, tooltips and warning tones), and allow the PI
Subjects to opt in for each extended business function；
b) If a PI Subject rejects the collection of the PI necessary for extended business functions,
the PI Controller shall not repeatedly ask the PI Subject for consent. Unless the PI
Subject proactively chooses to activate an extended business function, the number of
requests for consent to the PI Subject shall not exceed once in 48 hours;
c) If a PI Subject rejects the collection of the PI necessary for extended business functions,
the PI Controller shall not refuse to provide basic business functions or reduce the
quality of service of basic business functions;
d) The interactive interface or design required in C.4 a) shall make it convenient for PI
Subjects to re-access and change the scope of consent.
Note 1: See Annex C.5 for the implementation of the requirements above.

C.5 Design of interactive interface
PI Controllers may design an interactive interface by reference to Table C.1 so as to protect
PI Subjects’ full exercise of their right to choose and to give consent.
Such an interface shall be proactively provided by the PI Controller to the PI Subjects before
the PI Controller commences the collection of PI, in the course of product installation, when
30

a PI Subject uses a product or service for the first time, and when the a PI Subject creates an
account. In the event where sensitive PI is collected via written materials, the PI Controller
may design the interface by reference to the following template so as to protect the PI
Subjects’ full exercise of their right to choose and to give consent.

How we process children’s PI
Our products, websites and services are mainly adult oriented. A child
should not create his/her own account without consent of his/her parents or
guardians.
Children’s PI that is collected with their parents’ consent will only be used
or publicly disclosed when it is permitted by laws, explicitly consented to by
their parents or guardians, or is essential to protecting the children.
Although the definition of children varies in local laws and customs, we
regard anyone below 14 years old as a child.
If we find that a child’s PI has been collected without his/her parents’ prior
consent, we will delete relevant data as soon as possible.

How your PI is transmitted worldwide
In principle, the PI we collect and generate in the territory of the People’s
Republic of China will be stored within the People’s Republic of China.
We provide products or services based on our resources and servers
worldwide, that is to say, with your consent, your PI might be transmitted to
or accessed from a jurisdiction outside of the country/region where your
products or services are located.
Such jurisdiction might have a different data protection law, or even no
relevant laws. Under such circumstances, we will ensure that your PI will
enjoy the same level of protection as it does in the People’s Republic of
China. For instance, we will ask you for your consent to the cross-border
transmission of your PI, or employ data de-identification and other security
measures before the cross-border transmission of data.

If cross-border transmission of
information is required by
business needs or government or
judicial supervisions, the PI
Controller needs to clearly state
the types of data to be
transmitted across border and
the standards, agreements and
legal instruments (such as
contracts)
the
cross-border
transmission shall be bound by.

How this Policy will be updated
Our PI Protection Policy might be changed.
We will not reduce any of your rights under this PI Protection Policy
without your explicit consent. We will release any change to the Policy on
this page.
For major changes, we will provide a more conspicuous notice (including,
for certain services, notices via email that explains the details of the changes
to the PI Protection Policy).
The major changes to this Policy include but are not limited to:
1. Major changes in our service mode, e.g. the purpose of processing PI, the
type of processed PI, and how PI is used;
2. Major changes in our ownership structure, organizational structure, e.g.
the change of owners due to business adjustments, a(n) bankruptcy, merger
and acquisition.
3. Changes of the main object which PI is publicly disclosed to, shared with,
or transferred to;

When there is a major change to
the PI protection policy, the PI
Controller needs to update the PI
protection policy in time and
state the means to inform PI
Subjects
without
delay.
Generally, the followings means
can be used to inform the PI
Subjects: notifying the PI
Subjects when they log into the
information system, updating
the information system and
notifying the PI Subjects with a
pop-out window during their use
of the information system,
directly
sending
a
push
notification to the PI Subjects
when they are using the
information system, sending an
email or a text message to the PI
Subjects, etc.

4. Changes in your rights involved in PI processing and in how you exercise
such rights;
5. Changes of our responsible department, contacts and complaint channels
for PI protection;
6. When a PI impact assessment report indicates high risks.
We will also archive the old versions of this Policy for your reference.
