(2) Anyone who has obtained personal credit data on the data subject for the purpose of making a
decision pertaining to the data subject shall notify the data subject of the use of the credit data
in the decision-making, of the file from which the data have been obtained, of the time when

data file for the purposes of direct marketing, distance selling or other direct advertising, or of
market research or an opinion poll, or for a comparable addressed delivery, the file used, the

information of the regular sources of data in the file, on the uses for the data in the file and the
regular destinations of disclosed data. Where an automated decision referred to in section 31 is
involved, the data subject shall also have the right of access to information on the operating
principles of the pertinent automatic processing of data.
(2) A controller engaged in credit data activity shall upon the request of the data subject provide
information on the recipients and destinations of personal credit data on the data subject
disclosed during the preceding six months, as well as the sources of the data on the data
subject.
(3) The controller may charge for the provision of access to the data only if less than one year has
passed since the previous instance of providing the data subject with access to data in the file.

the data subject or to the rights of someone else;
(3) if the data in the file are used solely for historical or scientific research or statistical
purposes; or

of access provided in paragraph (1), the data subject shall have the right of access to the
remainder of the data.

Section 28 — Realisation of the right of access

data referred to in section 26 or, upon request, provide a hard copy of the data. The data shall
be given in an intelligible form. If the controller refuses to provide access to the data, a written
certificate to this effect shall be issued. The certificate shall also mention the reasons for the
refusal. A failure by the controller to give a written response to the data subject within three
months of the request is deemed equivalent to a refusal to provide access to the data. In this
event, the data subject may bring the matter to the attention of the Data Protection
Ombudsman.
(3) Anyone who wishes to have access to the data on himself/herself in the files of the health care
authorities and institutions, physicians and dentists or other health care professionals and
relating to their state of health or illness, shall make a request to this effect to a physician or
another health care professional, who shall then see to the obtainment of the data with the
consent of the data subject and provide him/her with access to the entries in the file.. The
provisions in paragraph (2) apply to the procedure in the realisation and refusal of the right of
access.
Section 29 — Rectification
(1) The controller shall, on its own initiative or at the request of the data subject, without undue
delay rectify, erase or supplement personal data contained in its personal data file and
erroneous, unnecessary, incomplete or obsolete as regards the purpose of the processing. The
controller shall also prevent the dissemination of such data, if this could compromise the
protection of the privacy of the data subject or his/her rights.
(2) If the controller refuses the request of a data subject of the rectification of an error, a written
certificate to this effect shall be issued.The certificate shall also mention the reasons for the
refusal. In this event, the data subject may bring the matter to the attention of the Data
Protection Ombudsman.
(3) The controller shall notify the rectification to the recipients to whom the data have been
disclosed and to the source of the erroneous personal data. However, there is no duty of
notification if this is impossible or unreasonably difficult.

or otherwise significantly affecting him/her, is permitted only if

(2) the decision is made in connection with the making or performance of an agreement,
