Deemed membership of the EU
(1)

Subject to paragraph (2), the Island is deemed to be a Member State of
the European Union.

(2)

(a)

the GDPR, except Chapter V (transfers of personal data to third
countries or international organisations); and

(b)

the LED, except Chapter V (transfers of personal data to third
countries or international organisations).

For the avoidance of doubt, paragraph (1) —
(a)

is not intended to and does not have the effect of rendering the
Island a Member State of the European Union; and

(b)

does not cede authority to the European Union in any respect, as
these implementing regulations remain an enactment made by the
Council of Ministers in exercise of power conferred by Tynwald;
and therefore the extent to which the provisions of the GDPR and
LED are applicable to the Island is solely dependent on decisions
taken locally and given legislative effect by Manx legislation.

PART 2 – PROVISIONS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE APPLIED
GDPR
Purpose
9

Purpose of this Part
(1)

This Part supplements the applied GDPR, on the basis that the GDPR is
automatically law in Member States and was accordingly written in a
manner which lends itself to application and enforcement with minimal
supporting or supplementary provisions in actual Member State law.
(Note that, in accordance with regulation 4, the Island is “deemed” to be
a Member State solely for the purposes of these Regulations. This is
merely for ease of reference and, in reality, does not have the effect of
conferring on the Island actual membership of the EU. The Island is
therefore not an “actual Member State”.)

(2)

There is a difference between “the GDPR” and “the applied GDPR”,
which is as follows —
(a)

“the GDPR” is the original EU instrument and applies to all
“actual Member States” of the EU; whereas

(b)

“the applied GDPR”12 is the Island’s version of the original.

The “applied GDPR” applies to the Island as part of the law of the Island
and is distinguishable from the original based on the exceptions,
adaptations and modifications evident in it.

12

(3)

Accordingly, this Part relies on (but does not replicate) provisions
already in the applied GDPR which confer clear rights, responsibilities,
duties and obligations on specified legal persons and natural persons.

(4)

This Part also requires every controller and processor to which the
applied GDPR applies to comply with the registration requirements in
Schedule 7.

(5)

Schedule 9 specifies restrictions and exemptions to the application of the
provisions of the applied GDPR. Those restrictions and exemptions are
in addition to the restrictions specified in regulations 20 to 24 or specified
in regulations made under regulation 25.

See the definition of this term in regulation 5(1).

official authority includes processing of personal data that is necessary for —
(a)

the administration of justice;

(b)

the exercise of a function of Tynwald and its branches;

information society services) —
(a)

references to “16 years” are to be read as references to “13 years”;
and

the reference to “information society services” does not include
preventive or counselling services.

relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures
that is not carried out under the control of official authority.

For the purposes of Article 9(2)(h) of the applied GDPR (processing for
health or social care purposes etc.), the circumstances in which the
processing of personal data is carried out subject to the conditions and
safeguards referred to in Article 9(3) of the applied GDPR (obligation of
secrecy) include circumstances in which it is carried out —

worker; or

(b)

by another person who in the circumstances owes a duty of
confidentiality under an enactment or rule of law.

In Article 10 of the applied GDPR, references to personal data relating to
criminal convictions and offences or related security measures include
personal data relating to —
(a)

the alleged commission of offences by the data subject; or

(b)

proceedings for an offence committed or alleged to have been
committed by the data subject or the disposal of such
proceedings, including sentencing.

In paragraph (1), “social worker” has the same meaning as is given to
that term in section 140 of the Regulation of Care Act 2013.

The requirements for authorisation here referred to are those specified in provisions of the
applied GDPR listed in paragraph (1).

to the data subject’s financial standing, unless the data subject has
indicated a contrary intention.

(3)

Where the controller discloses personal data in pursuance of Article 15(1)
to (3) of the applied GDPR, the disclosure must be accompanied by a
statement informing the data subject of the data subject’s rights to have
inaccurate information corrected.

Automated decision-making authorised by law: safeguards
(1)

This regulation makes provision for the purposes of Article 22(2)(b) of
the applied GDPR (exception from taking significant decisions based
solely on automated processing for decisions that are authorised by law
and subject to safeguards for the data subject’s rights, freedoms and
legitimate interests).

(2)

A decision is a “significant decision” for the purposes of this regulation
if, in relation to a data subject, it —

(3)

longer permits, identification of data subjects, the processing of personal
data for such purposes must be fulfilled in that manner.

(4)

Such processing does not satisfy the requirement in Article 89(1) for the
processing to be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of the data subject if the processing is carried out for the
purposes of measures or decisions with respect to a particular data
subject, unless the purposes for which the processing is necessary
include the purposes of approved medical research.

PART 3 – LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESSING
CHAPTER 1

Purpose and scope
26

Purpose of this Part
(1)

This Part makes provision to give effect to the applied Law Enforcement
Directive.

(2)

The Law Enforcement Directive, being a “Directive” as distinct from a
“Regulation” (which the GDPR is)15, is written in a style that indicates
that it requires laws other than itself to be made to give effect to it. The
Law Enforcement Directive contains numerous provisions that use

Under EU law, “Regulations” are automatically binding on all Member States and typically
leave relatively few matters for Member States to address by discrete domestic legislation. By
contrast, “Directives” are not generally written in a manner than lends itself to direct
application without the need for Member States to enact discrete domestic legislation to put in
place the legal rules that the Directives require. There remains, however, a legal obligation on
Member States to take the steps mandated by Directives, which invariably means the enacting
of discrete domestic legislation is obligatory.

Regulation 27

language such as “Member States shall provide”; in some instances,
provisions state that “Members States shall provide by law”.
(3)

Accordingly, this Part complies with stipulations such as those referred
to in paragraph (2) by expressly making provisions of the type the Law
Enforcement Directive mandates. In most instances the provisions of this
Part follow very closely the language of the corresponding, expressly
identified Articles of the applied LED. However, they differ from that
language to the extent required to impose the specific obligations that the
corresponding Articles of the applied LED demand be imposed.

(4)

In these Regulations —
(a)

the considerations specified in paragraphs (2); and

(b)

the description, set out in paragraph (3), of the approach to giving
domestic legislative effect to some provisions of the LED,

apply equally to the provisions specified in paragraph (5).
(5)

27

Those provisions are —
(a)

in Part 4, regulations 63 to 66 (data protection officers under the
applied LED); and

(b)

in Part 5, regulations 70 to 74 (transfers under the applied LED).

Processing to which this Part applies
(1)

This Part applies to —
(a)

the processing by a competent authority of personal data wholly
or partly by automated means; and

(b)

the processing by a competent authority otherwise than by
automated means of personal data which forms part of a filing
system or is intended to form part of a filing system.

(2)

Any reference in this Part to the processing of personal data is to
processing to which this Part applies.

(3)

For the meaning of “competent authority”, see Article 3(7) of the applied
LED and regulation 28.

Definitions

GDPR and LED Implementing Regulations 2018

The Council of Ministers may by regulations amend Schedule 1 —
(a)

so as to add a person to, or remove a person from, the Schedule;

(b)

so as to reflect any change in the name of a person specified in the
Schedule.

Regulations —
(a)

under paragraph (2)(a); or

(b)

made for the purposes of both paragraphs (2)(a) and (b),

are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.

29

(4)

Regulations under paragraph (2)(b) are subject to the negative resolution
procedure.

(5)

In this regulation, “statutory function” means a function under or by
virtue of any enactment.

“The law enforcement purposes”
For the purposes of this Part, “the law enforcement purposes” are the purposes
of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or
the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the
prevention of threats to public security.

30

Meaning of “controller” and “processor”
(1)

(2)

In this Part (as well as in Parts 4, 5 and 7 in so far as those Parts relate to
processing of personal data by competent authorities), “controller”
means the competent authority which, alone or jointly with others, —
(a)

determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal
data; or

(b)

is the controller by virtue of paragraph (2).

Where personal data are processed only —
(a)

for purposes for which it is required by an enactment to be
processed; and

(b)

by means by which it is required by an enactment to be processed,

the competent authority on which the obligation to process the data is
imposed by the enactment (or, if different, one of the enactments) is the
controller.
(3)

Page 30

In this Part (as well as in Parts 5 and 7 in so far as those Parts relate to
processing of personal data by competent authorities), “processor”
means any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another
body who processes personal data on behalf of the controller (other than
a person who is an employee of the controller).

concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic
situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour,
location or movements.

(4)

“Recipient”, in relation to any personal data, means any natural or legal
person, public authority, agency or another body to whom the data are
disclosed, whether a third party or not, but it does not include a public

may be prescribed by the Council of Ministers.
Tynwald procedure – approval required.

36

Distinction between personal data and verification of quality of
personal data: Article 7 of the applied LED
(1)

Personal data based on facts must be distinguished, as far as possible,
from personal data based on personal assessments.

(2)

A competent authority must take all reasonable steps to ensure that
personal data which are inaccurate, incomplete or no longer up to date
are not transmitted or made available.

(3)

In order to comply with paragraph (2), each competent authority must as

purposes or statistical purposes, unless the processing is carried out in an
activity which falls outside the scope of any portion of Union law that
applies to the Island as part of the law of the Island.

39

(4)

Where specific conditions for processing are imposed by law, the
transmitting competent authority must inform the recipient of such
personal data of those conditions and the requirement to comply with
them.

(5)

The transmitting competent authority must not apply conditions
pursuant to paragraph (4) to recipients in other Member States or to
agencies, offices and bodies established pursuant to Chapters 4 and 5 of
Title V of the TFEU other than those applicable to similar transmissions
of data within the Member State of the transmitting competent authority.

freedoms of natural persons.
This is subject to paragraph (2).

c

(2)

Notification under paragraph (1) must be without undue delay and,
where feasible, not later than 72 hours after the controller became aware
of the personal data breach. Where such notification is made more than
72 hours after the controller became aware of the breach, the notification
must be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the delay.

(3)

A processor must notify the controller without undue delay after
becoming aware of a personal data breach.

(4)

A notification under paragraph (1) must, at least, —
(a)

describe the nature of the personal data breach including, where
possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects
concerned and the categories and approximate number of
personal data records concerned;

(b)

communicate the name and contact details of the data protection
officer or other contact point where more information can be
obtained;

(c)

describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and

(d)

describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the
controller to address the personal data breach, including, where
appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

(5)

Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at
the same time, the information may be provided in phases without
undue further delay.

(6)

Every controller must document any personal data breach referred to in
paragraph (1). Such documentation must comprise the facts relating to
the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken, and
SD No. 2018/0145

61

Where a personal data breach involves personal data that have been
transmitted by or to the controller in another Member State, the
Information Commissioner must without delay communicate the
information referred to in paragraph (4) to that controller.

Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject: Article 31
of the applied LED
(1)

Where a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the
personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.

(2)

The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph (1) must
describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data
breach and must contain at least the information and measures referred
to in subparagraphs (b), (c) and (d) of regulation 60(4).

(3)

The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph (1) is not
required if any of the following conditions is met —
(a)

the controller has implemented appropriate technological and
organisational protection measures, and those measures were
applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach,
in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to
any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;
or

(b)

the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that
the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred
to in paragraph (1) is no longer likely to materialise;

(c)

it would involve disproportionate effort.

(4)

In the case described in paragraph (3)(c), the controller must instead
make a public statement or otherwise engage in public communication
that has the effect of informing data subjects of the breach in a manner
and to an extent that, in the opinion of the Information Commissioner, is
appropriate in the circumstances.

(5)

If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach
to the data subject, the Information Commissioner, having considered
the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may
require it to do so, or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in
paragraph (3) is met.

(6)

The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph (1) may
be delayed, restricted or omitted subject to the conditions and on the
