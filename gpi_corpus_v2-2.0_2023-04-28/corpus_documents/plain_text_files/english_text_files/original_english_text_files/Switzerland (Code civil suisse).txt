appoint the body which is lacking or an administrator.

In the event that the foundation is unable to organise itself effectively, the supervisory authority shall transfer its assets to another foundation with as similar objects as possible.

The foundation bears the cost of such measures. The supervisory
authority may require the foundation to make an advance payment to

Art. 106
II. Action for
annulment

An action for annulment is brought ex officio by the competent
cantonal authority at the domicile of the spouses; in addition, any
interested party is entitled to bring such action. Provided this is compatible with their duties, the federal and cantonal authorities shall
contact the authority competent for the action if they have reason to
believe that there are grounds for annulment.156

subject to a time
limit
I. Grounds

A spouse may seek a declaration of annulment if he or she:

temporarily lacked capacity of judgement at the time of the
wedding;

2.

married in error, whether because he or she did not wish to
marry at all or did not wish to marry the other person;

The provisions governing divorce apply mutatis mutandis to the
effects of a court declaration of annulment on the spouses and their

II. Partial
agreement

The spouses may jointly request divorce and ask the court to decide

Chapter Three: Consequences of Divorce
Art. 119168
A. Civil status of
divorced spouses

A spouse who has changed his or her surname on marriage retains
that surname following divorce; he or she may at any time declare
before the civil registrar the wish to revert to the name by which he or
she was known prior to the marriage.
1

Art. 120
B. Marital
property law and
inheritance law

The provisions of marital property law apply to the division of
marital property.
1

Divorced spouses have no rights of inheritance in relation to each
other and may not make claims based on testamentary dispositions
made before their divorce proceedings were made pending.
2

Art. 121
C. Family home

If a spouse must remain in the family home because of the children
or for other compelling reasons, the court may transfer the rights and
obligations under the tenancy agreement to that spouse provided this
is not inequitable for the other.
1

The previous tenant is jointly and severally liable for payment of the
rent up to the date on which the tenancy ends or may be terminated
pursuant to the tenancy agreement or by law, but for a maximum
period of two years; if an action is brought to recover rent due, he or
she is entitled to set off the amount paid in instalments equal to the
amount of the monthly rent against any maintenance payments owed
to the other spouse.
2

If the home belongs to the family of one of the spouses, the court
may, on the same conditions, grant the other spouse a right of residence for a fixed term in return for reasonable compensation or set-off
against maintenance payments. Where new and compelling reasons so
require, such right of residence may be restricted or revoked.

Paragraph 1 does not apply to one-off contributions from individual
property in accordance with the law.

The termination benefits to be divided are calculated on the basis of
Articles 15–17 and 22a or 22b of the Vested Benefits Act of
17 December 1993171.

Art. 124172
III. Equitable
division of
invalidity
pension prior to
statutory

If, at the point at which divorce proceedings commence, a spouse is
drawing an invalidity pension prior to the statutory retirement age, the
amount to which he or she would be entitled under Article 2 paragraph
1ter of the Vested Benefits Act of 17 December 1993173 following
cancellation of the invalidity pension counts as the termination benefits.
1

The provisions on the equitable division of termination benefits
apply mutatis mutandis.
2

The Federal Council determines in which cases the amount under
paragraph 1 may not be applied in the division because there has been
a reduction due to over-compensation.

Art. 124a174
IV. Equitable
division in the
case of invalidity
pensions after
statutory

and in the case
of retirement
pensions

If, at the point at which divorce proceedings commence, a spouse is
drawing an invalidity pension after the statutory retirement age or
drawing a retirement pension, the court decides at its own discretion
how the pension is to be divided. In doing so it primarily takes into
account the duration of the marriage and the pension requirements of
each spouse.
1

The share of the pension awarded to the spouse entitled thereto is
converted into a life-long pension. This is paid to the entitled spouse
by the liable spouse’s occupational pension fund or is transferred to
the entitled spouse’s own occupational pension fund.

Art. 124b175
V. Exceptions

The spouses may, in an agreement on the consequences of the divorce, agree not to divide the assets equally or not to divide them at all
if there are sufficient retirement pension and invalidity pension funds
otherwise.
1

The court may award the entitled spouse less than half of the termination benefits or rule that they should not be divided if good cause
exists. Good cause exists above all when equal division would be
unreasonable:
2

1.

in view of the division of marital property or the economic
circumstances following divorce;

2.

in view of the pension requirements, in particular with regard
to the difference in age between the spouses.

The court may award the entitled spouse more than half of the termination benefits if he or she cares for joint children following the
divorce and the liable spouse continues to have sufficient retirement
and invalidity pension assets.

Art. 124c176
VI. Offset of
mutual entitlements

The spouses’ mutual entitlements to termination benefits or a share
of a pension are offset. The pension entitlement is offset before the
share of the pension awarded to the entitled spouse is converted into a
life-long pension.

VII. Unreasonableness

If, having considered the pension requirements of both spouses, an

Art. 124e178

VIII. Impossibility

1 If the equitable division of pension fund assets is not possible, the
liable spouse shall owe the entitled spouse adequate compensation in
the form of a lump sum payment or as a pension.

A Swiss judgment may be amended at the request of the liable
spouse if pension entitlements existing abroad have been offset by
adequate compensation pursuant to paragraph 1 and such pension
entitlements are then divided up in a foreign decision that is binding
on the foreign party liable to pay pension contributions.
2

Art. 125
E. Post-marital
maintenance
I. Requirements

If a spouse cannot reasonably be expected to provide for his or her
own maintenance, including an appropriate level of retirement provision, the other spouse must pay a suitable contribution.
1

In deciding whether such a contribution is to be made and, if so, in
what amount and for how long, the following factors in particular
must be considered:
2

177

1.

the division of duties during the marriage;

2.

the duration of the marriage;

3.

the standard of living during the marriage;

4.

the age and health of the spouses;

5.

the income and assets of the spouses;

6.

the extent and duration of child care still required of the
spouses;

7.

the vocational training and career prospects of the spouses and
the likely cost of reintegration into working life;

8.

expectancy of federal old age and survivor’s insurance benefits and of occupational or other private or state pensions, including the expected proceeds of any division of withdrawal
benefits.

44

210

Swiss Civil Code

Exceptionally, a maintenance contribution may be denied or reduced
if it would clearly be inequitable, particularly because the spouse
otherwise entitled to receive such contribution:
3

1.

has grossly neglected his or her duty to contribute to the
maintenance of the family;

2.

has wilfully brought about his or her own indigence;

3.

has committed a serious criminal offence against the other
spouse or a person close to him or her.

Art. 126
II. Modalities of
maintenance
contributions

The court shall fix an amount to be paid periodically by way of
maintenance contribution and set the date on which the duty of
maintenance commences.
1

Where justified in specific circumstances, a lump sum settlement
may be ordered instead of regular payments.
2

3

The court may attach conditions to the maintenance contribution.

Art. 127
III. Regular
payments
1. Special terms

The spouses may wholly or in part exclude any alteration of the regular maintenance payments stipulated in the agreement.
Art. 128

2. Adjustment
for inflation

The court may direct that the maintenance contribution will automatically increase or decrease depending on specified changes in the cost
of living.
Art. 129
In the event of a substantial and enduring change in circumstances,
the periodic maintenance payments may be reduced, cancelled or
suspended for a certain time; an improvement in the circumstances of
the party entitled to maintenance may be taken into account only if the
payments stipulated in the divorce decree provided sufficient maintenance.

3. Adjustment by 1
court order

The party entitled to maintenance may request that the payments be
adjusted in line with future inflation if the income of the other party
has increased unexpectedly since the divorce.
2

Within five years of the divorce, the party entitled to maintenance
may request that payments be ordered or increased provided the
divorce decree states that it was not possible at that time to order
sufficient maintenance payments and provided the economic circumstances of the party obliged to pay maintenance have since improved.

party entitled to receive maintenance.
2

Art. 131179
IV. Enforcement
1. Enforcement
assistance

Where the liable party fails to pay maintenance, an official agency
designated by cantonal law shall on request, in an appropriate way and
usually without charge, assist the party entitled to maintenance to
enforce his or her claims.

2

The Federal Council determines the terms of enforcement assistance.

Art. 131a180
2. Advance
payments

Public law may provide for advance payments to be made should the
liable person fail to make the necessary maintenance payments.
1

If the state authority makes maintenance payments to the entitled
person, the maintenance entitlement with all rights is assigned to the
state authority.
2

Art. 132
3. Directions to
debtors and
posting security181

If the party obliged to pay maintenance fails to do so, the court may
order his debtors to make payment in whole or in part to the party
entitled to maintenance.
1

If the party obliged to pay maintenance persistently fails to do so, or
if there are grounds to suspect that said party is preparing to abscond
or is dissipating or concealing his assets, the court may order him to
post appropriate security for future maintenance contributions.

property

the acquisition, improvement or preservation of assets belonging to
the other and if the value of the latter has increased or diminished, the
claim for compensation corresponds to the proportionate contribution
made and is calculated according to the value of the assets at the time
of the liquidation or their disposal.

Art. 218
VI. Payment of
the participation
claim and the
share of the
increased value
1. Deferred
payment

If immediate payment of the participation claim and the share of the
increased value would cause serious difficulties for the debtor, he or
she may request a deferral.

Unless otherwise agreed by the spouses, the participation claim and
the share of the increased value bear interest as of completion of the
division of property and, where justified in the circumstances, security
must be furnished.

household
effects

To ensure that the surviving spouse may maintain his or her accustomed lifestyle, at his or her request he or she will be granted a usufruct of or a right of residence in the home in which the spouses lived
and which belonged to the deceased spouse, and this will be set off
against his or her entitlement, subject to any contrary provision in the
marital agreement.
1

On the same conditions, he or she may request that ownership of the
household effects be transferred to him or her.
2

Where justified in the circumstances, at the request of the surviving
spouse or the other legal heirs of the deceased spouse, ownership of
the home may be granted rather than a usufruct or right of residence.
3

The surviving spouse may not claim such rights in respect of premises in which the deceased practised a profession or ran a business and
which are required by one of his or her issue in order to continue said
profession or business, subject to the provisions of agricultural inheritance law.
4

Art. 220
If the assets of the debtor or his or her estate are insufficient to cover
the participation claim on division of the property, the entitled spouse
or his or her heirs may demand from third-party beneficiaries the
return of such dispositions as are to be added to the acquired property
up to the amount of the shortfall.

3. Claims against 1
third parties

The right to bring a claim is extinguished one year after the spouse
or his or her heirs learn of the infringement of their rights, but in any
event ten years after the dissolution of the marital property regime.
2

Moreover, the provisions governing claims in abatement under
inheritance law apply mutatis mutandis.206

1. Right to
challenge

Recognition may be challenged before the courts by any interested
party, namely the mother, the child or, after its death, its issue, and by
the commune of origin or domicile of the recognising person.

The recognising person is entitled to file a challenge only if he or she
recognised the child under threat of imminent and substantial risk to
his or her own life, limb, reputation or property or to those of a person
close to him or her, or in the erroneous belief that he was the father.

Art. 273287
D. Contact
I. Parents and
children
1. Principle

Parents not granted parental responsibility or whose children are not
resident with them are entitled to reasonable contact with their minor
children, and their children are entitled to contact with them. 288
1

The child protection authority may remind parents, foster parents or
the child of their duties and issue them with instructions where the
exercise or failure to exercise contact entitlements is detrimental to the
child or where such reminder or direction is required for some other
reason.
2

Contact entitlements must be stipulated if either the father or the
mother so requests.
3

Art. 274289
2. Restrictions

The father and the mother must refrain from any conduct that impairs the child’s relationship with the other parent or makes the task of
the person with custody more difficult.290
1

Where contact with the child is not in its best interests, or the parents
breach their duties in the course of such contact or have not cared for
the child to any meaningful degree, or other good cause exists, the
parents’ right of contact with the child may be refused or withdrawn.
2

Where the parents have consented to the adoption of their child or
their consent may be dispensed with, their right of contact with the
child is extinguished as soon as the child is placed in foster care with a
view to future adoption.
3

Art. 274a291
II. Third parties

In extraordinary circumstances, a right of contact with the child may
also be granted to other persons and in particular to relatives, to the
extent this serves the child’s best interests.

Art. 275292
III. Responsible
authorities

Responsibility for orders regulating rights of contact with the child
lies with the child protection authority at the child’s domicile and with
that of his or her place of temporary residence, insofar as the latter has
taken or is taking child protection measures.
1

If the court regulates parental responsibility, residence or the child
maintenance contribution in accordance with the provisions on the
divorce and protection of the marital union, it shall also regulate
contact.293
2

Where no orders have yet been issued regulating the father’s and
mother’s contact entitlements, no contact may be had against the will
of the person granted parental responsibility or with whom the child
resides.
3

Art. 275a294
E. Right to
information

Parents who do not exercise parental responsibility should be informed of special events in the child’s life and consulted before important decisions affecting its development are taken.
1

They are entitled to obtain information concerning the child’s condition and development from third parties involved in its care, such as
teachers and doctors, in the same manner as the person with parental
responsibility.
2

The provisions governing responsibility for and limitations on contact with the child apply mutatis mutandis.

The parents must, each according to their own abilities, provide for
the child’s maintenance, including the costs of caring for and raising
the child, his or her education and measures taken for his or her protection.299
2

The parents are released from their duty of maintenance to the extent
that the child may reasonably be expected to meet the costs thereof
from his or her own earnings or other resources.

II. Precedence of
maintenance for
minors

The duty of maintenance towards a minor shall take precedence over
other maintenance duties under family law.

In justified cases, the court may disregard this rule, in particular in
order to prevent any disadvantage to a child entitled to maintenance
who is of age.
2

Art. 277301
B. Duration

The parents’ duty of maintenance lasts until the child attains the age
of majority.302
1

If at that juncture the child has not yet had a suitable education, the

Unless the court rules otherwise, any child allowance, social security
children’s supplement and similar child support benefits to which the
parent subject to the duty of maintenance is entitled must be paid in
addition to the child maintenance contribution.
2

Where as a result of old age or invalidity the parent subject to the
duty of maintenance subsequently receives social security, children’s
supplements or similar child support benefits which replace his or her
employment income, he or she must pay said benefits to the child; by
operation of law, his or her existing child maintenance contribution is
automatically reduced by the amount of such new benefits.

Art. 286311
V. Change of
circumstances
1. In general312

The court may order that the child maintenance contribution be
automatically increased or decreased in the event of specified changes
in the child’s needs, the parents’ financial resources or the cost of
living.
1

If circumstances change considerably, at the request of one parent or
the child the court will set a new level of child maintenance contribution or revoke it entirely.
2

Should the child have unforeseen, extraordinary needs the court may
order the parents to make a special financial contribution.313
3

Art. 286a314
2. Shortfalls

If it was previously established in an approved maintenance agreement or a decision that no maintenance contribution could be set to
provide due maintenance for the child, and should the circumstances
of the parent liable to pay maintenance have since improved substantially, the child is entitled to claim payments that were not met by this
parent during the previous five years in which payments were owed to
provide due maintenance.
1

This claim must be brought within one year of it being known that
the circumstances have improved substantially.
2

This claim passes with all rights to the other parent or to the state
authority in as far as this parent or the state authority has met the
missing share of the due maintenance.

Maintenance agreements are binding on the child only once they
have been approved by the child protection authority.

Where maintenance contributions are set in a maintenance agreement,
the agreement must specify:

the income and assets of each parent and each child from
which the set amount is calculated;

b.

the amount set for each child;

III. Final
settlement318

Full and final settlement of the child’s maintenance entitlement may
be agreed if it is in the child’s best interests.

2

The settlement agreement becomes binding on the child only:
1.

once the child protection authority or, in the case of an agreement reached during court proceedings, the court has approved
it, and

2.

once the settlement amount has been paid into the account
designated in the approval.

Art. 289319
F. Fulfilment
I. Entitlement

The right to child maintenance contributions is that of the child and,

Art. 482
B. Burdens and
conditions

The testator may attach burdens or conditions to the disposition, the
fulfilment of which may be requested by any interested party once the
disposition becomes effective.
1

Immoral or unlawful burdens or conditions render the disposition
null and void.
2

Where they are merely onerous to third parties or meaningless, they
are deemed not to exist.
3

If an animal receives a bequest by testamentary disposition, this
disposition is deemed to be a burden by which the animal must be
cared for according to its needs.461
4

Art. 483
C. Naming of
heirs

The testator may name one or more heirs to the entire estate or to a
fraction thereof.

whole or a part of the estate, or he or she may instruct the heirs or
other legatees to make payments to that person from the value of the
estate or to release that person from obligations.

the estate and no other intention is evident from the disposition, no
obligation is placed on the obligor of the legacy.

obligor of the
legacy

Art. 486
III. Relationship
to the estate

Where the legacies exceed the value of the estate or of the bequest to
the obligor or of the disposable part, application may be made to have
them abated proportionately.
1

If the obligors do not survive the testator, are unworthy to inherit or
disclaim their inheritance, the legacies remain nonetheless effective.

the latter has the right to claim the legacy even if he or she disclaims
his or her inheritance.

3

The same provisions apply to legacies.

Art. 489
II. Time of
delivery

Except where the disposition stipulates otherwise, the time of delivery is deemed to be the death of the provisional heir.
1

Where a different time is specified and that time has not yet occurred
on the death of the provisional heir, the inheritance passes to his or her
heirs against security.
2

If for whatever reason that time may no longer occur, the inheritance
passes unreservedly to the heirs of the provisional heir.
3

Art. 490
III. Security

In all cases in which remaindermen are designated, the competent
authority must order an inventory to be drawn up.
1

Delivery of the inheritance to the provisional heir is made only
against security, except where the testator has expressly released him
or her from such an obligation; in the case of immovable property,
security may be provided by entering the delivery obligation under
priority notice in the land register.

deliver it.
2

Art. 492
2. Of the
remainderman

at the stipulated delivery time.
1

inheritance or disclaims the inheritance, it passes to the remainderman.
3

Art. 492a462

capacity of
judgement

The designation of the remainderman ceases to apply by law if the
issue, contrary to expectation, becomes capable of judgement.
2

Art. 493
G. Foundations

The testator is entitled to bequeath all or part of the disposable
portion of his or her property to a foundation for any purpose of his or
her choosing.

of inheritance
1. Significance

The testator may conclude an inheritance renunciation contract with
an heir with or without valuable consideration.

2

The renouncing party is not deemed to be an heir on succession.

Unless the contract provides otherwise, the renunciation of an inheritance also applies to the issue of the renouncing party.
3

Art. 496
2. Void renunciation

Where certain persons are named in the renunciation contact as heirs
in lieu of the renouncing party, the renunciation is void if such persons
fail to acquire the inheritance for whatever reason.
1

Where an inheritance is renounced in favour of co-heirs, the renunciation is presumed to be effective only in respect of the heirs of the line
descending from their nearest common ascendant and has no effect
with regard to more distant heirs.
2

Art. 497
3. Rights of the
creditors of the
estate

If the deceased was insolvent on commencement of the succession
process and his or her creditors are not satisfied by the heirs, the
renouncing party and his or her heirs may be held liable to the extent
that they received valuable consideration for the renounced inheritance within the five years prior to the death of the deceased and were
still enriched by such consideration on succession.

if it was made by the testator at a time when he or she lacked
testamentary capacity;

wills

If the formal defect in a holographic will consists in the day, month or
year not being indicated correctly or at all, the will may be declared

B. Action in
abatement
I. Requirements
1. In general

Where the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom,
those heirs who do not receive the full value of their statutory entitlement may sue to have the disposition abated to the permitted amount.
1

Clauses contained in testamentary dispositions relating to the entitlements of the statutory heirs are deemed merely to be instructions for
dividing the estate unless it is evident from the disposition that the
testator intended otherwise.
2

Art. 523
2. Bequests in
favour of heirs
with a statutory
entitlement

Where a testamentary disposition contains legacies in favour of several heirs with a statutory entitlement and the testator has exceeded his
or her testamentary freedom, such legacies shall be abated among the
co-heirs in proportion to the amounts by which they exceed each coheir’s statutory entitlement.
Art. 524

3. Rights of
creditors

Where the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom to
the detriment of an heir and the latter fails to bring a action in abatement despite being instructed to do so by the bankruptcy administrators or by creditors holding unpaid debt certificates on succession, the
administrators or creditors themselves may bring an action in abatement for the amount necessary to cover their claims within the same
time limit that applies to the heir.
1

The same right applies in the case of a disinheritance not contested
by the person disinherited.
2

Art. 525
II. Effect
1. Of abatement
in general

Abatement is applied in equal proportion in respect of all named
heirs and legatees unless it is evident from the disposition that the
testator intended otherwise.

to be abated, the legatee may either claim it and pay the balance or
claim the disposable amount in lieu of the object.
Art. 527

3. On dispositions inter vivos
a. Cases

The following are subject to abatement in the same manner as testamentary dispositions:
1.

advances against a person’s share of an inheritance made in
the form of wedding gifts, settlements or assignments of assets, to the extent these are not subject to hotchpot;

2.

compensation payments in settlement of future rights of inheritance;

3.

gifts that were freely revocable by the deceased or made in the
five years prior to his or her death, with the exception of customary occasional gifts;

4.

assets alienated by the deceased with the obvious intention of
circumventing the limitations on his or her testamentary freedom.

Art. 528
b. Restitution

A person acting in good faith has a duty of restitution only to the
extent that he or she is still enriched by such transactions with the
deceased at the time of succession.
1

Where benefits conferred under a contract of succession are subject
to abatement, the beneficiary is entitled to reclaim a proportionate
amount of the counter-performance made to the testator.
2

Art. 529
4. On assurance
claims

Where a life assurance claim maturing on the death of the deceased
was established in favour of a third party by a disposition inter vivos
or by a testamentary disposition or was transferred by the deceased
during his or her lifetime to a third party without valuable consideration, such claim is subject to abatement at its redemption value.
Art. 530

5. On usufruct
and annuities

If the testator has encumbered the estate with rights of usufruct and
annuities such that their capitalised value over their probable duration
exceeds the disposable part of the estate, the heirs are entitled either to
seek proportionate abatement of such rights or to redeem them by
surrendering the disposable part of the estate to the beneficiaries.

210

Swiss Civil Code

Art. 531469
6. On naming of
remaindermen

The naming of a remainderman in respect of an heir entitled to a
statutory entitlement is invalid as to that part of the estate; the provision on issue who are incapable of judgement is reserved.
Art. 532

III. Order of
abatement

Abatement applies first to testamentary dispositions and thereafter to
dispositions inter vivos in reverse chronological order until the statutory entitlement has been reconstituted.
Art. 533

IV. Prescription

A claim in abatement prescribes one year after the date on which the
heirs learned of the infringement of their rights and in any event after
ten years have elapsed since the succession, in the case of testamentary disposition, or since the testator’s death, in the case of other
dispositions.
1

If the declaration of the invalidity of a later disposition revives an
earlier one, the prescriptive periods begin on the date on which invalidity was declared.

The entitlement to abatement may be invoked as a defence at any
time.

acquired property since the transfer, except where otherwise provided

Art. 548
II. Succession
rights of persons
presumed dead

If it is impossible to determine whether an heir is alive or dead when
succession commences because he or she has disappeared, his or her
share of the inheritance is placed under official administration.
1

Those who would succeed to the missing heir’s share if he or she
were dead may request the court to declare the heir presumed dead
one year after his or her disappearance in life-threatening circumstances or five years after the last sign of life and, once such declaration has been made, may apply for release of their shares of his or her
inheritance.
2

Such shares are released according to the provisions governing
release to the heirs of persons presumed dead.
3

Art. 549
III. Correlation
of the two cases

If the heirs of the person presumed dead are already in possession of
his or her property and an inheritance passes to him or her, his or her
co-heirs may invoke this fact and request that such inheritance be
released to them without need for a second declaration of presumed
death.
1

The heirs of the person presumed dead may likewise invoke a declaration of presumed death obtained by the co-heirs.
2

Art. 550
IV. Procedure ex
officio

Where the missing person’s property or succession rights have been
under official administration for ten years or more, or he or she would
have reached the age of 100, at the request of the competent authority
the declaration of presumed death is pronounced ex officio.
1

If no rightful heirs come forward during the public notice period, the
property of the person presumed dead passes to the state authority
with right to succeed or, if he or she was never resident in Switzerland, to the canton of origin.
2

The local authority or canton concerned has the same duty of restitution as those put in possession of the estate towards the person presumed dead and parties with prevailing claims.

Unless otherwise provided by testamentary disposition, the claim
becomes due once the obligor has accepted the inheritance or is no
longer able to disclaim it.
2

If the heirs fail to fulfil their obligation, they may be sued for release
of the bequeathed property or, where the legacy pertains to performance of some action, for damages.
3

Art. 563
2. Object

Where the bequest to the legatee is a usufruct or annuity or other
recurring benefit, unless otherwise stipulated, his or her claim is
determined according to the provisions of property law and the Code

testator, the legatee is entitled to assert that claim directly.
2

Art. 564
3. Relationship
between
creditors and
legatees

testator’s creditors, provided the heir acquired the inheritance without
reservation.
2

Art. 565
4. Abatement

If, after the legacies have been distributed, the heirs pay debts of the
estate that were previously unknown to them, they are entitled to
reimbursement from the legatees of an amount corresponding to the

However, the legatees may be held liable only in the amount by
which they are enriched at the time such reimbursement is demanded.
2

Art. 566
B. Disclaimer
I. Declaration
1. Right to
renounce

The legal and named heirs are entitled to disclaim the inheritance
passing to them.

The time limit for a disclaimer is three months.

For statutory heirs, this limit begins on the date on which they
learned of the death, unless they can show that they did not learn of

their succession rights until later, and for named heirs it begins on the
date on which they received official notification of the testator’s
disposition.
Art. 568

an inventory

If an inventory has been drawn up as a precautionary measure, the
disclaimer time limit for all heirs begins on the date on which the
authority notified them that the inventory was complete.
Art. 569

3. Passing of
right to disclaim

If an heir dies before disclaiming or accepting an inheritance, the
right to disclaim passes to his or her heirs.
1

For such heirs, the disclaimer time limit begins on the date on which
they learned that the inheritance passed to the deceased heir and ends
no sooner than the date on which the time limit for disclaiming the
inheritance from the deceased heir expires.
2

Where such heirs disclaim the inheritance and it passes to other heirs
who previously had no succession rights, the disclaimer time limit for
the latter begins on the date on which they learned of the disclaimer.

An heir must declare his or her disclaimer orally or in writing to the
competent authority.

1

Where an heir has interfered in the affairs of the estate before expiry
of the disclaimer time limit or has acted in a manner not conducive to
administering the estate or maintaining the deceased’s business activities, or where he or she has appropriated or concealed objects belonging to the estate, he or she is no longer entitled to disclaim the inheritance.
2

Art. 572
III. Disclaimer
by one co-heir

Where the deceased has not made a testamentary disposition and one
of two or more heirs disclaims the inheritance, his or her share of the
estate passes to the other heirs as if he or she had predeceased.

Where the deceased has made testamentary disposition, any share of
the estate disclaimed by a named heir passes to the testator’s nearest
statutory heirs, unless other intentions on the part of the testator are
evident from the disposition.
2

Art. 573
IV. Disclaimer
by all the nearest
heirs
1. In general

Where the inheritance is disclaimed by all the nearest heirs, the
estate is liquidated by the bankruptcy office.

offered to their subsequent heirs before the estate is liquidated.

Where there is good cause, the competent authority may grant the
legal and named heirs an extension of the time limit or set a new one.
Art. 577

obligor, unless other intentions on the part of the testator are evident
from his or her disposition.

VII. Security for
the heir’s
creditors

Where an overindebted heir has disclaimed an inheritance in order to
withhold it from his or her creditors, the latter or the bankruptcy
administrators may challenge the disclaimer within six months unless
their claims are secured.
1

If their challenge is upheld, the inheritance is placed in official
liquidation.
2

168

210

Swiss Civil Code

Any surplus serves first to satisfy the challenging creditors and any
balance remaining after redemption of the other debts passes to the
heirs in whose favour the disclaimer was made.
3

Art. 579
VIII. Liability in
the event of
disclaimer

Where the deceased was insolvent and his or her heirs disclaim the
inheritance, they remain liable to his or her creditors to the extent that
in the five years prior to his or her death they received property or
assets from him or her which on division of the estate would have
been subject to hotchpot.

Alterations which permanently hinder or render unprofitable a coowner’s use or exploitation of the object for its existing purpose may
not be carried out without the consent of that co-owner.

Where an alteration would require a co-owner to bear unreasonable
costs, in particular because they are disproportionate to the value of
his or her share, the alteration may be carried out without his or her
consent only if the other co-owners assume such part of his or her
share of the costs as exceeds that which he or she may reasonably be
expected to meet.

court order if, as a result of his or her conduct or that of persons to
whom he or she granted use of the object or for whom he or she is
responsible, his or her duties towards the other co-owners individually
or collectively are so seriously violated that continuation of the community of co-owners becomes unreasonable.
1

Where the community comprises only two co-owners, each has the
right to sue the other; in other cases, unless otherwise agreed, legal
action against one co-owner must be authorised by a majority of all
the co-owners excluding the person to be sued.

If the court rules in favour of excluding the defendant, it shall order
him or her to alienate his or her share and, should he or she fail to do
so within the allowed time limit, shall order it to be sold at public
auction in accordance with the provisions governing the forced sale of
land to the exclusion of the provisions governing dissolution of coownership.

If the co-owners are unable to agree on the method of dissolution,
the court will order the physical division of the object or, where this is
impossible without substantially diminishing its value, its sale at
public auction or private auction among the co-owners.

c. Animals kept
as pets

In the event of disputes over ownership of animals kept as pets rather
than for investment or commercial purposes, the court will award sole
ownership to whichever party offers the better conditions of animal
welfare in which to keep the animal.
1

The court may order the person to whom ownership of the animal is
awarded to provide appropriate compensation to the other party; the
court determines the amount at its discretion.

The court shall take all necessary provisional measures, in particular
in relation to the animal’s care in the interim.

3. Formation of
new land

If new exploitable land is formed from previously ownerless land as
a result of alluvion, filling or ground displacement, changes in the
course or level of public waters or in some other manner, such land
belongs to the canton in which it lies.
1

The cantons are free to allocate such land to owners of adjoining
land.

If a person can show that parts of ground have become detached
from his or her property, he or she is entitled to take them back within
an appropriate period.

Art. 660
4. Ground
displacement
a. In general521

Ground displacement from one parcel of land to another does not
alter the boundaries of the parcels.

Earth and other objects moving from one parcel to the other in the
process are subject to the provisions governing driftage or the joining
and mixing of chattels.
2

Art. 660a522
b. Constant
ground displacement

The general principle whereby ground displacement does not alter
land boundaries does not apply to areas designated by the cantons as
being in permanent danger of ground displacement.
1

When designating such areas, due consideration shall be given to the
characteristics of the land in question.
2

Where a parcel of land forms part of such an area, this fact must be
notified in an appropriate manner to the interested parties and recorded in the land register.

Art. 661
5. Adverse
possession
a. Ordinary
adverse possession

Where a person has been wrongly recorded in the land register as the

challenged if he or she has been in possession of it in good faith,
uninterruptedly and without challenge for ten years.
Art. 662

b. Extraordinary
adverse possession

Where a person has been in possession of immovable property not
recorded in the land register uninterruptedly and without challenge for
30 years as if it were his or her property, he or she has the right to be
registered as the owner.
1

The same right applies on the same conditions to a person in possession of immovable property whose owner is not evident from the land
register or who was declared dead or presumed dead at the beginning
of the 30-year adverse possession period.
2

However, such registration may be made only by court order on
expiry of a publicly notified period for objections, provided no such
objections have been raised or those raised have been dismissed.

measures
I. Where the
owner cannot be
found

If the owner recorded in the land register cannot be identified, if his
or her address is unknown or if the name or address of one or more of
his or her heirs is unknown, the court may on application order the
required measures.
1

The court may in particular appoint a representative. On application,
it shall stipulate the extent of the powers of representation. Unless it

Chapter Two:
Substance and Limitation of Land Ownership
Art. 667

1

Within the limits prescribed by law, it includes all buildings and
plants as well as springs.
2

Art. 668
II. Boundaries
1. Type of
boundary

boundary markings on the land itself.
1

In the event of discrepancy between the existing land register plans
and the boundary markings, the land register plans are presumed
correct.
2

The foregoing presumption does not apply to areas designated by the
canton as being in permanent danger of ground displacement. 527
3

Art. 669
2. Duty to
establish
boundaries

Every landowner is obliged, at the request of his or her neighbour, to
co-operate in establishing the boundary where it is unclear, whether by
amendment of the land register plans or by affixing boundary markers.
Art. 670

3. Co-ownership
of boundary
markers

Where boundaries are marked by features such as walls, hedges and
fences, such features are presumed to be jointly owned by the two
neighbouring landowners.

Art. 672
b. Compensation

must provide appropriate compensation for the cost of the materials.
1

Where the landowner on whose land the building work was carried
out acted in bad faith, the court may award full damages.

Where the owner of the materials used in the building work acted in
bad faith, the damages awarded may not exceed the minimum value of
the building work to the landowner.
3

Art. 673
c. Assignment of
land ownership

Where the value of the building plainly exceeds the value of the land,
the party acting in good faith may request that ownership of both
building and land be assigned to the owner of the materials in exchange for appropriate compensation.

2. Encroaching
buildings

Buildings and other structures encroaching from one parcel of land
onto another remain part of the parcel from which they originate,
providing their owner has a right in rem to their existence.
1

The right to encroach on neighbouring land may be recorded as an
easement in the land register.
2

If an injured party fails to object in timely manner to an unauthorised
encroachment, despite being aware of it, where justified in the circumstances the builder of the encroaching structure, provided he or she
acted in good faith, may be granted ownership of the encroaching part
thereof or of the land below it in exchange for appropriate compensation.
3

Art. 675
3. Building right

Buildings and other structures that are dug into or built onto land
belonging to another person or otherwise permanently connected with
that parcel of land on or below its surface may have a separate owner
provided their existence is recorded as an easement in the land register.

located outside the parcel of land which they serve are, except where
otherwise regulated, the property of the utility plant from which they
come or to which they lead.528

encumbrance of parcels of land by rights in rem relating to such pipes,
cables and conduits belonging to another person is established by way
of easement.

the pipe, cable or conduit is laid. In other cases, it is created by entry
in the land register.529

IV. Plants grown
on the parcel of
land

Where a person uses another person’s plants on his or her own land
or his or her own plants on another person’s land, the same rights and
obligations arise as for the use of building materials or for movable
structures.
1

An easement corresponding to a building right may be created in
respect of individual plants and plantations for a minimum of ten and
a maximum of 100 years.530
2

The servient owner may request the termination of the easement
before the end of the agreed duration in the event of the termination of
a lease agreement concluded between him or her and the easement
beneficiary concerning the use of the land. The court shall determine
the financial consequences taking due account of all the circumstances.531

his or her land in exchange for full compensation, to the extent that
such works would be impossible or prohibitively expensive if they did
not traverse his or her land.547
1

The right for pipes, cables and conduits to traverse an adjoining
parcel of land may not be claimed on the basis of the law of neighbours in cases subject to compulsory purchase under cantonal or
federal law.
2

At the request of the dominant or the servient owner, such rights
shall be recorded in the land register as an easement at the expense of
the dominant owner. The right for pipes, cables and conduits to traverse an adjoining parcel of land may be cited in opposition to a person
acquiring a parcel of land in good faith, even if it is not registered.548

b. Safeguarding
the interests of
the servient
landowner

The servient owner is entitled to just and equitable consideration of
his or her own interests.

Where justified by extraordinary circumstances, he or she may
request that the piece of the land above which overhead pipes, cables
and conduits are to be routed together with a reasonable portion of the
surrounding land be purchased from him or her at its full value.
2

Art. 693
c. Change of
circumstances

If circumstances change, the servient owner may request that the
route of the pipe, cable or conduit be altered in accordance with his or
her interests.

The costs of such re-routing are normally borne by the owner of the
dominant property.

However, where justified by special circumstances, an appropriate
portion of the costs may be charged to the servient owner.

This right is in the first place exercised against the neighbour who, in
the light of existing ownership and access circumstances, may most
reasonably be expected to grant such right of way, and secondly in
respect of the neighbour for whom it is least damaging.

Art. 695
b. Other rights of

Where it is possible to carry out land improvements, such as watercourse modifications, drainage, irrigation, reforestation, path-building,
land consolidation procedures and the like, only by collective endeavour and such endeavour has been approved by the majority of the
landowners owning more than half of the land involved, the other
landowners are obliged to participate. Landowners who choose not to
participate in the decision-making process are deemed to consent.
Participation is recorded in the land register.

The cantons regulate the procedure. In particular, they must issue
detailed rules on consolidation of landholdings.

an essential
water source

If a parcel of land lacks the water required for domestic and farming

except at an entirely disproportionate cost and effort, the owner may
request that a neighbour able to spare such water without suffering
hardship allow him or her a share of the latter’s spring or well to him
or her in exchange for full compensation.

Chapter Three:551 Condominium
Art. 712a
A. Definition
and object
I. Definition

Condominium is a form of co-ownership of immovable property that
gives the co-owner the exclusive right to make sole use of specific
parts of a building thereon and design the interior of such parts.
1

Each condominium owner is free to manage, use and design the
structure of his or her own parts of the building as he or she wishes but
must not obstruct any other condominium owners in the exercise of
their own rights or in any way damage the common parts of the building, fittings and installations or impair their functional effectiveness or
appearance.
2

Each condominium owner is obliged to maintain his or her parts of
the building in the manner required to preserve the sound condition
and good appearance of the building as a whole.
3

Art. 712b
II. Object

The object of the exclusive right may be individual storeys or parts
of a storey which must be self-contained with their own access and
used either as dwellings or as self-contained units of rooms used for
business or other purposes, although separate ancillary rooms are
allowed.
1

The condominium owner may not be granted an exclusive right to
the following:
2

1.

the land on which the building stands and the building right by
virtue of which it is constructed;

2.

the parts of the building that are vital to the soundness, structure and stability of the building as a whole or of the units of
other condominium owners or that determine the outward
form and appearance of the building;

3.

the fittings and installations that also serve the other condominium owners in the use of their units.

The deed of constitution or a subsequent agreement among the
condominium owners executed in the same form may stipulate that
other parts of the building are common property, failing which they
are presumed to be the object of a exclusive right.

Art. 712c
III. Power of
disposal

Condominium owners do not by law have first right of refusal in
respect of a third party acquiring a share, but such right may be stipulated in the deed of constitution or by subsequent agreement and
entered under priority notice in the land register.
1

Similarly, it may be stipulated that the alienation, encumbrance with
usufruct or right of residence or letting of a unit is valid only if the
other co-owners do not object by resolution made within 14 days of
receiving notice of such transaction.
2

3

The objection is ineffective if made without good cause.552

Art. 712d
B. Creation and
extinction
I. Deed of
constitution

1

Condominium is constituted by entry in the land register.

2

Such entry may be requested:
1.

on the basis of an agreement between the condominium owners to constitute their shares as condominium;

2.

on the basis of a declaration by the owner of the property or
the holder of a distinct and permanent building right to form
shares in co-ownership and to constitute the same as condominium.

In order to be valid, the constitution of condominium must be executed in the form of a public deed or, where provided for in a testamentary disposition or in a contract of division of estate, in the form
prescribed by the law of succession.

surroundings.
Art. 712f
III. Extinction

Condominium is extinguished on the loss of the property or the
building right and its deletion from the land register.
1

Such deletion may be requested in accordance with a termination
agreement or by a single condominium owner holding all the shares,
but it requires the consent of all persons with rights in rem to the
individual units which cannot be transferred to the property as a whole
without detriment.
2

Any condominium owner may request termination of the condominium where:
3

1.

more than half the value of the building has been destroyed
and reconstruction would impose an onerous burden on him;
or

2.

the building has been divided into condominium units for
more than 50 years and can no longer be used in accordance
with the regulations due to its poor structural condition.555

Except where such provisions are mandatory, they may be replaced
by others set out in the deed of constitution or adopted by unanimous
resolution of the assembly of condominium owners.

Moreover, each condominium owner is entitled to request that a set
of rules governing administration and use be drawn up and noted in
the land register, such rules being binding once accepted by resolution
passed by a majority of the condominium owners who together represent more than one-half of the property and being subject to amendment by the same majority even if included in the deed of constitution.

3. Unilateral
redemption
a. Conditions
and procedure

Where a property is mortgaged for more than its value in respect of
debts for which the acquirer is not personally liable, and providing no
debt enforcement proceedings are pending, cantonal law may authorise the acquirer to redeem the mortgage rights either by paying the
purchase price to the creditors or, where the property was acquired
without payment, the amount at which he or she values the property.
1

or her intention to redeem the mortgage.
2

The redemption amount is distributed among the creditors according
to their rank.
3

Within one month of the acquirer’s notification, the creditors are
entitled to request that the mortgaged property be sold at public auction provided that they advance the costs, such auction to be announced publicly and held within one month of the date on which it
was requested.

If a higher price than the one offered is obtained at auction, the
mortgage is redeemed at that higher price.

The costs of the public auction are borne by the acquirer if a higher
price is obtained, or otherwise by the creditor who requested the
auction.
3

2. Division

If part of a mortgaged property or one of two or more mortgaged
properties belonging to the same owner is alienated or if the mortgaged property is divided, unless otherwise agreed, liability under the
mortgage will be reallocated in proportion to the value of the different
parts.

month of its becoming final he or she may request repayment of his or
her debt within one year.

3.

the claims of tradesmen and building contractors who have
supplied labour and materials, or labour alone, for construction or other works, for demolition work, scaffolding work or
for securing the construction pit or similar on the property
whether the debtor is the owner of the property, tradesman or
building contractor, tenant or any other person with rights to
the property.

If a tenant or other person with rights to the property is liable for
debts due to tradesmen or building contractors, the claim is valid only
if the property owner has consented to the work being done.

and building
contractors
a. Registration

A tradesman's or building contractor’s lien may be recorded in the
land register as of the date of his or her undertaking to perform work.
1

Application for such entry must be made within four months of
completion of the work.
2

The lien is entered only if the claim has been acknowledged by the
owner or confirmed in a court judgment and may not be requested if
the owner provides the claimant with adequate security.
3

If the property is indisputably administrative assets and if the owner's liability for the debt is not based on contractual obligations, the
owner shall be liable to the tradesmen or building contractor for debts
that are acknowledged or determined by a court in accordance with the
provisions on a debt subject to a simple surety, provided a written
claim for the debt making reference to the statutory surety was made
against the owner no later than four months after completion of the
work.
4

If there is a dispute as to whether immovable property constitutes
administrative assets, the tradesman or building contractor may apply
for the provisional recording of the lien in the land register no later
than four months after completion of the work.
5

If it is held in a court judgment that the immovable property constitutes administrative assets, the provisional recording of the lien must
be deleted. It shall be replaced by the statutory surety provided the
requirements of paragraph 4 are met. The deadline is met with the
provisional recording of the lien.
6

Art. 840
b. Rank

If more than one statutory building contractor’s lien is recorded in the
land register, such liens confer an equal entitlement to satisfaction
from the mortgaged property even if the entries were made on different dates.
Art. 841

c. Privileged
claim

613

Where the claims of tradesmen and building contractors are not
wholly satisfied by foreclosure, the shortfall must be compensated for
by the higher-ranking creditors out of such portion of the proceeds as
exceeds the land value, provided it is apparent to such creditors that
their liens have encumbered the property to the detriment of the
tradesmen and building contractors.
