(1) Before granting an authorisation [F78under section 61 or 61A], the designated senior
officer must consult a person who is acting as a single point of contact in relation to
the granting of authorisations.
(2) But, if the [F79officer or (as the case may be)] designated senior officer considers that
there are exceptional circumstances which mean that [F80subsection (A1) or (as the
case may be) (1)] should not apply in a particular case, that subsection does not apply
in that case.
(3) Examples of exceptional circumstances include—
(a) an imminent threat to life or another emergency, or
(b) the interests of national security.
(4) A person is acting as a single point of contact if that person—
(a) is an officer of a relevant public authority, and
(b) is responsible for advising—
(i) officers of the relevant public authority about applying for
authorisations [F81(whether under section 60A, 61 or 61A)], or
(ii) designated senior officers of the relevant public authority about
granting authorisations.
(5) A person acting as a single point of contact may, in particular, advise an officer of
a relevant public authority who is considering whether to apply for an authorisation
about—
(a) the most appropriate methods for obtaining data where the data concerned is
processed by more than one telecommunications operator,
(b) the cost, and resource implications, for—
(i) the relevant public authority concerned of obtaining the data, and
(ii) the telecommunications operator concerned of disclosing the data,
(c) any unintended consequences of the proposed authorisation, and
(d) any issues as to the lawfulness of the proposed authorisation.
(6) A person acting as a single point of contact may, in particular, advise a designated
senior officer who is considering whether to grant an authorisation about—
(a) whether it is reasonably practical to obtain the data sought in pursuance of the
proposed authorisation,
(b) the cost, and resource implications, for—
(i) the relevant public authority concerned of obtaining the data, and
(ii) the telecommunications operator concerned of disclosing the data,
(c) any unintended consequences of the proposed authorisation, and
(d) any issues as to the lawfulness of the proposed authorisation.
(7) A person acting as a single point of contact may also provide advice about—
(a) whether requirements imposed by virtue of an authorisation have been met,
(b) the use in support of operations or investigations of communications data
obtained in pursuance of an authorisation, and
(c) any other effects of an authorisation.
(8) Nothing in this section prevents a person acting as a single point of contact from also
applying for, or being granted, an authorisation or, in the case of a designated senior
officer, granting an authorisation.

Approval of retention notices by Judicial Commissioners
(1) In deciding whether to approve a decision to give a retention notice, a Judicial
Commissioner must review the Secretary of State's conclusions as to whether the
requirement to be imposed by the notice to retain relevant communications data is
necessary and proportionate for one or more of the purposes falling within [F109subparagraphs (i) to (vi) of section 87(1)(a)].
(2) In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must—
(a) apply the same principles as would be applied by a court on an application
for judicial review, and
(b) consider the matters referred to in subsection (1) with a sufficient degree of
care as to ensure that the Judicial Commissioner complies with the duties
imposed by section 2 (general duties in relation to privacy).
(3) Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to give a retention
notice, the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary of State written reasons for
the refusal.
(4) Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers Commissioner,
refuses to approve a decision to give a retention notice, the Secretary of State may ask
the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to decide whether to approve the decision to
give the notice.

Variation or revocation of notices
94

Variation or revocation of notices
(1) The Secretary of State may vary a retention notice.
(2) The Secretary of State must give, or publish, notice of the variation in such manner as
the Secretary of State considers appropriate for bringing the variation to the attention
of the telecommunications operator (or description of operators) to whom it relates.
(3) A variation comes into force—
(a) when notice of it is given or published in accordance with subsection (2), or
(b) (if later) at the time or times specified in the notice of variation.
(4) A retention notice may not be varied so as to require the retention of additional relevant
communications data unless—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the requirement is necessary and
proportionate for one or more of the purposes falling within [F111subparagraphs (i) to (vi) of section 87(1)(a)], and
(b) subject to subsection (6), the decision to vary the notice has been approved
by a Judicial Commissioner.
(5) The fact that additional relevant communications data which would be retained under
a retention notice as varied relates to the activities in the British Islands of a trade
union is not, of itself, sufficient to establish that the requirement to retain the data is
necessary for one or more of the purposes falling within [F112sub-paragraphs (i) to (vi)
of section 87(1)(a)].
(6) Subsection (4)(b) does not apply to a variation to which section 90(11) applies.
(7) Section 87(2) and (5) apply in relation to a retention notice as varied as they apply in
relation to a retention notice, but as if the references to the notice coming into force
included references to the variation coming into force.
(8) Sections 87(3), (4) and (8), 95 and 97, and subsections (1), (4), (13) and (16) of this
section, apply in relation to a retention notice as varied as they apply in relation to a
retention notice.
(9) Section 88 applies in relation to the making of a variation as it applies in relation
to the giving of a retention notice (and, accordingly, the references to the notice in
section 88(1)(a) to (e) are to be read as references to the variation).
(10) Section 89 applies in relation to a decision to vary to which subsection (4)(b) above
applies as it applies in relation to a decision to give a retention notice (and, accordingly,
the reference in subsection (1) of that section to the requirement to be imposed by the
notice is to be read as a reference to the requirement to be imposed by the variation).
(11) Section 90 applies (but only so far as the variation is concerned) in relation to a
retention notice as varied (other than one varied as mentioned in subsection (10)(a) of
that section) as it applies in relation to a retention notice.

(12) Section 91 applies in relation to a decision under section 90(10) to vary or confirm
a variation as it applies in relation to a decision to vary or confirm a retention notice
(and, accordingly, the reference in subsection (1) of that section to the requirement
to be imposed by the notice as varied or confirmed is to be read as a reference to the
requirement to be imposed by the variation as varied or confirmed).
(13) The Secretary of State may revoke (whether wholly or in part) a retention notice.
(14) The Secretary of State must give or publish notice of the revocation in such manner as
the Secretary of State considers appropriate for bringing the revocation to the attention

(b) (if later) at the time or times specified in the notice of revocation.
(16) The fact that a retention notice has been revoked in relation to a particular description
of communications data and a particular operator (or description of operators) does
not prevent the giving of another retention notice in relation to the same description
of data and the same operator (or description of operators).

Power to issue warrants
102

Power to issue warrants to intelligence services: the Secretary of State
(1) The Secretary of State may, on an application made by or on behalf of the head of an
intelligence service, issue a targeted equipment interference warrant if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is necessary on grounds
falling within subsection (5),
(b) the Secretary of State considers that the conduct authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) the Secretary of State considers that satisfactory arrangements made for the
purposes of sections 129 and 130 (safeguards relating to disclosure etc.) are
in force in relation to the warrant, and
(d) except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
issue the warrant, the decision to issue the warrant has been approved by a
Judicial Commissioner.
(2) But the Secretary of State may not issue a targeted equipment interference warrant
under subsection (1) if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the only ground for considering the
warrant to be necessary is for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious
crime, and
(b) the warrant, if issued, would authorise interference only with equipment
which would be in Scotland at the time of the issue of the warrant or which
the Secretary of State believes would be in Scotland at that time.
For the power of the Scottish Ministers to issue a targeted equipment interference
warrant, see section 103.
(3) The Secretary of State may, on an application made by or on behalf of the head of an
intelligence service, issue a targeted examination warrant if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is necessary on grounds
falling within subsection (5),
(b) the Secretary of State considers that the conduct authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is or may be necessary
to authorise the selection of protected material for examination in breach
of the prohibition in section 193(4) (prohibition on seeking to identify
communications of, or private information relating to, individuals in the
British Islands), and
(d) except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
issue the warrant, the decision to issue the warrant has been approved by a
Judicial Commissioner.
(4) But the Secretary of State may not issue a targeted examination warrant under
subsection (3) if the warrant, if issued, would relate only to a person who would be in
Scotland at the time of the issue of the warrant or whom the Secretary of State believes

in the interests of national security,
for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, or
in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom so far as
those interests are also relevant to the interests of national security.

(6) A warrant may be considered necessary on the ground falling within subsection (5)(c)
only if the interference with equipment which would be authorised by the warrant is
considered necessary for the purpose of obtaining information relating to the acts or
intentions of persons outside the British Islands.

activities in the British Islands of a trade union is not, of itself, sufficient to establish
that the warrant is necessary on grounds falling within subsection (5).
(8) An application for the issue of a warrant under this section may only be made on behalf
of the head of an intelligence service by a person holding office under the Crown.

BULK ACQUISITION WARRANTS
Bulk acquisition warrants
158

Power to issue bulk acquisition warrants
(1) The Secretary of State may, on an application made by or on behalf of the head of an

proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 161) is a
purpose for which the examination of communications data obtained
under the warrant is or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of such data for each such purpose is necessary on
any of the grounds on which the Secretary of State considers the
warrant to be necessary,
(d) the Secretary of State considers that satisfactory arrangements made for the
purposes of section 171 (safeguards relating to the retention and disclosure of

communications data relating to the acts or intentions of persons outside the British
Islands.
(4) The fact that the communications data which would be obtained under a warrant relates
to the activities in the British Islands of a trade union is not, of itself, sufficient to
establish that the warrant is necessary in the interests of national security or on that
ground and a ground falling within subsection (2).
(5) A bulk acquisition warrant is a warrant which authorises or requires the person to
whom it is addressed to secure, by any conduct described in the warrant, any one or

equipment interference warrant is to be selected for examination—
(a) the selection of the material for examination meets any of the selection
conditions in section 193(3)(a) to (c), and
(b) either—
(i) the purpose, or one of the purposes, of using the criteria to be used for
the selection of the material for examination (“the relevant criteria”)
is to identify any items subject to legal privilege, or
(ii) the use of the relevant criteria is likely to identify such items.
(2) The material may be selected for examination using the relevant criteria only if a senior
official acting on behalf of the Secretary of State has approved the use of those criteria.

(a) the official considers that the arrangements made for the purposes of
section 191 (safeguards relating to retention and disclosure of material)
include specific arrangements for the handling, retention, use and destruction
of items subject to legal privilege, and
(b) where subsection (1)(b)(i) applies, the official considers that there are
exceptional and compelling circumstances that make it necessary to authorise
the use of the relevant criteria.

circumstances that make it necessary to authorise the use of the relevant criteria
unless—
(a) the public interest in obtaining the information that would be obtained by the

equipment interference warrant is retained following its examination, for purposes
other than the destruction of the item, the person to whom the warrant is addressed
must inform the Investigatory Powers Commissioner as soon as is reasonably
practicable.
(For provision about the grounds for retaining material obtained under a bulk
equipment interference warrant, see section 191.)

Issue of warrants
204

Class BPD warrants
(1) The head of an intelligence service, or a person acting on his or her behalf, may apply
to the Secretary of State for a class BPD warrant.
(2) The application must include—
(a) a description of the class of bulk personal datasets to which the application
relates, and
(b) in a case where the intelligence service is seeking authorisation for the
examination of bulk personal datasets of that class, the operational purposes
which it is proposing should be specified in the warrant (see section 212).
(3) The Secretary of State may issue the warrant if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security,
(ii) for the purposes of preventing or detecting serious crime, or
(iii) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom
so far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national
security,
(b) the Secretary of State considers that the conduct authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by the conduct,
(c) where the warrant authorises the examination of bulk personal datasets of the
class described in the warrant, the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 212) is a
purpose for which the examination of bulk personal datasets of that
class is or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of bulk personal datasets of that class for each such
purpose is necessary on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of
State considers the warrant to be necessary,
(d) the Secretary of State considers that the arrangements made by the intelligence
service for storing bulk personal datasets of the class to which the application
relates and for protecting them from unauthorised disclosure are satisfactory,
and
(e) the decision to issue the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
(4) The fact that a class BPD warrant would authorise the retention, or the retention and
examination, of bulk personal datasets relating to activities in the British Islands of
a trade union is not, of itself, sufficient to establish that the warrant is necessary on
grounds falling within subsection (3)(a).

warrant.
(3) Case 2 is where—
(a) the intelligence service is seeking authorisation to retain, or to retain and
examine, a bulk personal dataset, and
(b) the bulk personal dataset falls within a class described in a class BPD warrant
but either—
(i) the intelligence service is prevented by section 202(1), (2) or (3) from
retaining, or retaining and examining, the bulk personal dataset in
reliance on the class BPD warrant, or
(ii) the intelligence service at any time considers that it would be
appropriate to seek a specific BPD warrant.

where the warrant authorises the examination of a bulk personal dataset, the
Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 212) is a
purpose for which the examination of the bulk personal dataset is or
may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of the bulk personal dataset for each such purpose
is necessary on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of State
considers the warrant to be necessary,
the Secretary of State considers that the arrangements made by the intelligence
service for storing the bulk personal dataset and for protecting it from
unauthorised disclosure are satisfactory, and
except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
issue the warrant, the decision to issue it has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.

(7) The fact that a specific BPD warrant would authorise the retention, or the retention
and examination, of bulk personal datasets relating to activities in the British Islands
of a trade union is not, of itself, sufficient to establish that the warrant is necessary on
grounds falling within subsection (6)(a).
(8) A specific BPD warrant relating to a bulk personal dataset (“dataset A”) may also
authorise the retention or examination of other bulk personal datasets (“replacement
datasets”) that do not exist at the time of the issue of the warrant but may reasonably
be regarded as replacements for dataset A.
(9) An application for a specific BPD warrant may only be made on behalf of the head of
an intelligence service by a person holding office under the Crown.

Further and supplementary provision
220

Initial examinations: time limits
(1) This section applies where—
(a) an intelligence service obtains a set of information otherwise than in the
exercise of a power conferred by a warrant or other authorisation issued or
given under this Act, and
(b) the head of the intelligence service believes that—
(i) the set includes, or may include, personal data relating to a number
of individuals, and
(ii) the nature of the set is, or may be, such that the majority of the
individuals are not, and are unlikely to become, of interest to the
intelligence service in the exercise of its functions.
(2) The head of the intelligence service must take the following steps before the end of
the permitted period.
Step 1 Carry out an initial examination of the set for the purpose of deciding
whether, if the intelligence service were to retain it after that initial examination
and hold it electronically for analysis for the purposes of the exercise of its
functions, the intelligence service would be retaining a bulk personal dataset (see
section 199).
Step 2 If the intelligence service would be retaining a bulk personal dataset as
mentioned in step 1, decide whether to retain the set and hold it electronically
for analysis for the purposes of the exercise of the functions of the intelligence
service.
Step 3 If the head of the intelligence service decides to retain the set and hold
it electronically for analysis as mentioned in step 2, apply for a specific BPD
warrant as soon as reasonably practicable after making that decision (unless the
retention of the dataset is authorised by a class BPD warrant).
(3) The permitted period begins when the head of the intelligence service first forms the
beliefs mentioned in subsection (1)(b).
(4) The permitted period ends—

obtained, and
(c) obtaining the information is necessary in the interests of national security or
for the purpose of preventing death or significant injury.

intention of furthering a criminal purpose, would be an item subject to legal
privilege, and
(b) the person to whom the warrant is addressed considers that the data (“the
targeted data”) or any underlying material is likely to be data or underlying
material created or held with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose.
(10) If the relevant criteria are referable to an individual known to be in the British Islands
at the time of the selection, the data may be selected for examination using the relevant
criteria only if the Secretary of State has approved the use of those criteria.

to the item, the Commissioner may nevertheless impose such conditions under
subsection (2)(b) as the Commissioner considers necessary for the purpose of
protecting the public interest in the confidentiality of items subject to legal privilege.
