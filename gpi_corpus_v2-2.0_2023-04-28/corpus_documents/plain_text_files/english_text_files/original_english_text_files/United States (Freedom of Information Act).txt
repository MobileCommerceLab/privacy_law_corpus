Politicas Informacion

(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying for public inspection
in an electronic format
(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;
(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the
Federal Register;
(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;
(D) copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released to any person under paragraph (3) and
which, because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject
of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; and copies of all records, regardless of form or format –
(i) that have been released to any person under paragraph (3); and
(ii)(I) that because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency determines have become or are
likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; or
(II) that have been requested 3 or more times; and
(E) a general index of the records referred to under subparagraph (D);
unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. For records created on or after November 1, 1996, within
one year after such date, each agency shall make such records available, including by computer telecommunications or, if computer
telecommunications means have not been established by the agency, by other electronic means. To the extent required to prevent a
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an
opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, staff manual, instruction, or copies of records referred to in subparagraph (D).
However, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing, and the extent of such deletion shall be
indicated on the portion of the record which is made available or published, unless including that indication would harm an interest
protected by the exemption in subsection (b) under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the extent of the deletion
shall be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion was made. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for
public inspection and copying current public inspection in an electronic format current indexes providing identifying
information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be
made available or published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise)
copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication
would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of an index on request at a cost
not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. Each agency shall make the index referred to in subparagraph (E) available by computer
telecommunications by December 31, 1999. A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction
that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency
only if—
(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or
(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof.
(3)(A) Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, and except as provided in
subparagraph (E), each agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in
accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records
promptly available to any person.
(B) In making any record available to a person under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any form or
format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or format. Each agency shall
make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible for purposes of this section.
(C) In responding under this paragraph to a request for records, an agency shall make reasonable efforts to search for the
records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's
automated information system.
(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "search" means to review, manually or by automated means, agency records for
the purpose of locating those records which are responsive to a request.
(E) An agency, or part of an agency, that is an element of the intelligence community (as that term is defined in section 3(4)
of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4))) shall not make any record available under this paragraph to—
(i) any government entity, other than a State, territory, commonwealth, or district of the United States, or any
subdivision thereof; or
(ii) a representative of a government entity described in clause (i).
(4)(A)(i) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and
receipt of public comment, specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of requests under this section and
establishing procedures and guidelines for determining when such fees should be waived or reduced. Such schedule shall conform
to the guidelines which shall be promulgated, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, by the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget and which shall provide for a uniform schedule of fees for all agencies.
(ii) Such agency regulations shall provide that—
(I) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when
records are requested for commercial use;
(II) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought
for commercial use and the request is made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose
purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a representative of the news media; and
(III) for any request not described in (I) or (II), fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for
document search and duplication.
In this clause, the term ‘a representative of the news media’ means any person or entity that gathers information of
potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and
distributes that work to an audience. In this clause, the term ‘news’ means information that is about current events or
that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations
broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of
‘news’) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public.
These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the
electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be
considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if
the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the
journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an
expectation; the Government may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a
determination.
(iii) Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under clause
(ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the
requester.
(iv) Fee schedules shall provide for the recovery of only the direct costs of search, duplication, or review. Review costs
shall include only the direct costs incurred during the initial examination of a document for the purposes of
determining whether the documents must be disclosed under this section and for the purposes of withholding any
portions exempt from disclosure under this section. Review costs may not include any costs incurred in resolving
issues of law or policy that may be raised in the course of processing a request under this section. No fee may be
charged by any agency under this section—
(I) if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee;
or
(II) for any request described in clause (ii)(II) or (III) of this subparagraph for the first two hours of search
time or for the first one hundred pages of duplication.
(v) No agency may require advance payment of any fee unless the requester has previously failed to pay fees in a
timely fashion, or the agency has determined that the fee will exceed $250.
(vi) Nothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically providing for setting the
level of fees for particular types of records.
(vii) In any action by a requester regarding the waiver of fees under this section, the court shall determine the matter
de novo: Provided, That the court's review of the matter shall be limited to the record before the agency.
(viii) An agency shall not assess search fees (or in the case of a requester described under clause (ii)(II), duplication
fees) under this subparagraph if the agency fails to comply with any time limit under paragraph (6), if no unusual or
exceptional circumstances (as those terms are defined for purposes of paragraphs (6)(B) and (C), respectively) apply
to the processing of the request. (I) Except as provided in subclause (II), an agency shall not assess any
search fees (or in the case of a requester described under clause (ii)(II) of this subparagraph,
duplication fees) under this subparagraph if the agency has failed to comply with any time limit
under paragraph (6).
(II)(aa) If an agency has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as the term is defined
in paragraph (6)(B)) and the agency provided a timely written notice to the requester in
accordance with paragraph (6)(B), a failure described in subclause (I) is excused for an
additional 10 days. If the agency fails to comply with the extended time limit, the agency may
not assess any search fees (or in the case of a requester is described under clause (ii)(II) of this
subparagraph, duplication fees).
(bb) If an agency has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages
are necessary to respond to the request, an agency may charge search fees (or in the case of a
requester described under clause (ii) (II) of this subparagraph, duplication fees) if the agency
has provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with paragraph 6(B) and
the agency has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or
made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the
scope of the request in accordance with paragraph (6)(B)(ii).
(cc) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist (as that term is defined in
paragraph (6)(C)), a failure described in subclause (I) shall be excused for the length of time
provided by the court order.
(B) On complaint, the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal
place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has jurisdiction to enjoin the
agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the
complainant. In such a case the court shall determine the matter de novo, and may examine the contents of such agency
records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set
forth in subsection (b) of this section, and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action. In addition to any other matters
to which a court accords substantial weight, a court shall accord substantial weight to an affidavit of an agency concerning
the agency's determination as to technical feasibility under paragraph (2)(C) and subsection (b) and reproducibility under
paragraph (3)(B).
(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the defendant shall serve an answer or otherwise plead to any complaint
made under this subsection within thirty days after service upon the defendant of the pleading in which such complaint is
made, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause is shown.
[(D) Repealed. Pub. L. 98-620, title IV, Sec. 402(2), Nov. 8, 1984, 98 Stat. 3357.]
(E)(i) The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred
in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a complainant has substantially prevailed if the complainant has obtained
relief through either—
(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree; or
(II) a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency, if the complainant’s claim is not insubstantial.
(F)(i) Whenever the court orders the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant and
assesses against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs, and the court additionally issues a
written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether agency personnel acted
arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to
determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the
withholding. The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, shall submit his findings
and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies of the findings and
recommendations to the officer or employee or his representative. The administrative authority shall take the corrective
action that the Special Counsel recommends.
(ii) The Attorney General shall—
(I) notify the Special Counsel of each civil action described under the first sentence of clause (i); and
(II) annually submit a report to Congress on the number of such civil actions in the preceding year.
(iii) The Special Counsel shall annually submit a report to Congress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel under
clause (i).
(G) In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district court may punish for contempt the responsible
employee, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member.
(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the final votes of
each member in every agency proceeding.
(6)(A) Each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, shall—
(i) determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of any such
request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such
determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency any
adverse determination; making such a request of –
(I) such determination and the reasons therefor;
(II) the right of such person to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison of the agency; and
(III) in the case of an adverse determination –
(aa) the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency, within a period determined by
the head of the agency that is not less than 90 days after the date of such adverse
determination; and
(bb) the right of such person to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison
of the agency or the Office of Government Information Services; and
(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part
upheld, the agency shall notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that
determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection.
The 20-day period under clause (i) shall commence on the date on which the request is first received by the
appropriate component of the agency, but in any event not later than ten days after the request is first received by any
component of the agency that is designated in the agency’s regulations under this section to receive requests under
this section. The 20-day period shall not be tolled by the agency except—
(I) that the agency may make one request to the requester for information and toll the 20-day period while it is
awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested from the requester under this section; or
(II) if necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fee assessment. In either case, the agency’s
receipt of the requester’s response to the agency’s request for information or clarification ends the tolling
period.
(B)(i) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii)
of subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the unusual
circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall
specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days, except as provided in clause (ii) of this
subparagraph.
(ii) With respect to a request for which a written notice under clause (i) extends the time limits prescribed under
clause (i) of subparagraph (A), the agency shall notify the person making the request if the request cannot be
processed within the time limit specified in that clause and shall provide the person an opportunity to limit the scope
of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an
alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. To aid the requester, each agency shall make
available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the
agency the agency, and notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution
services from the Office of Government Information Services. Refusal by the person to reasonably modify
the request or arrange such an alternative time frame shall be considered as a factor in determining whether
exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of subparagraph (C).
(iii) As used in this subparagraph, "unusual circumstances" means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the
proper processing of the particular requests—
(I) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are
separate from the office processing the request;
(II) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct
records which are demanded in a single request; or
(III) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having
a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency
having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
(iv) Each agency may promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, providing for the
aggregation of certain requests by the same requestor, or by a group of requestors acting in concert, if the agency
reasonably believes that such requests actually constitute a single request, which would otherwise satisfy the unusual
circumstances specified in this subparagraph, and the requests involve clearly related matters. Multiple requests
involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.
(C)(i) Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be
deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the
applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph. If the Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the
agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency
additional time to complete its review of the records. Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request for
records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person making such request. Any notification of denial of any
request for records under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the
denial of such request.
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "exceptional circumstances" does not include a delay that results
from a predictable agency workload of requests under this section, unless the agency demonstrates reasonable
progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.
(iii) Refusal by a person to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative time frame for
processing a request (or a modified request) under clause (ii) after being given an opportunity to do so by the agency
to whom the person made the request shall be considered as a factor in determining whether exceptional
circumstances exist for purposes of this subparagraph.
(D)(i) Each agency may promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, providing for multitrack
processing of requests for records based on the amount of work or time (or both) involved in processing requests.
(ii) Regulations under this subparagraph may provide a person making a request that does not qualify for the fastest
multitrack processing an opportunity to limit the scope of the request in order to qualify for faster processing.
(iii) This subparagraph shall not be considered to affect the requirement under subparagraph (C) to exercise due
diligence.
(E)(i) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, providing for expedited
processing of requests for records—
(I) in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need; and
(II) in other cases determined by the agency.
(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), regulations under this subparagraph must ensure—
(I) that a determination of whether to provide expedited processing shall be made, and notice of the
determination shall be provided to the person making the request, within 10 days after the date of the request;
and
(II) expeditious consideration of administrative appeals of such determinations of whether to provide
expedited processing.
(iii) An agency shall process as soon as practicable any request for records to which the agency has granted expedited
processing under this subparagraph. Agency action to deny or affirm denial of a request for expedited processing
pursuant to this subparagraph, and failure by an agency to respond in a timely manner to such a request shall be
subject to judicial review under paragraph (4), except that the judicial review shall be based on the record before the
agency at the time of the determination.
(iv) A district court of the United States shall not have jurisdiction to review an agency denial of expedited processing
of a request for records after the agency has provided a complete response to the request.
(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "compelling need" means—
(I) that a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis under this paragraph could reasonably be
expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
(II) with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to
inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
(vi) A demonstration of a compelling need by a person making a request for expedited processing shall be made by a
statement certified by such person to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge and belief.
(F) In denying a request for records, in whole or in part, an agency shall make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of
any requested matter the provision of which is denied, and shall provide any such estimate to the person making the request,
unless providing such estimate would harm an interest protected by the exemption in subsection (b) pursuant to which the
denial is made.
(7) Each agency shall—
(A) establish a system to assign an individualized tracking number for each request received that will take longer than ten
days to process and provide to each person making a request the tracking number assigned to the request; and
(B) establish a telephone line or Internet service that provides information about the status of a request to the person making
the request using the assigned tracking number, including—
(i) the date on which the agency originally received the request; and
(ii) an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request.
(8)(A) An agency shall –
(i) withhold information under this section only if –
(I) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an
exemption described in subsection (b); or
(II) disclosure is prohibited by law; and
(ii)(I) consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines
that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible; and
(II) take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information; and
(B) Nothing in this paragraph requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from
disclosure by law, or otherwise exempted from disclosure under subsection (b)(3).
(b) This section does not apply to matters that are—
(1)(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or
foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;
(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;
(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute-(A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or
(ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and
(B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.
(4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
(5) inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency
in litigation with the agency, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25
years or more before the date on which the records were requested;
(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy;
(7) records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law
enforcement records or information (A) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) would deprive
a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy, (D) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State,
local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case
of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an
agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source, (E) would
disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or (F)
could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;
(8) contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or
(9) geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.
Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions
which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made,
shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the
exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted, and
the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.
(c)(1) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in subsection (b)(7)(A) and—
(A) the investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and
(B) there is reason to believe that (i) the subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and (ii)
disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the agency
may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this
section.
(2) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal
identifier are requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier, the agency may treat the records
as not subject to the requirements of this section unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed.
(3) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pertaining to
foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism, and the existence of the records is classified information as
provided in subsection (b)(1), the Bureau may, as long as the existence of the records remains classified information, treat the
records as not subject to the requirements of this section.
(d) This section does not authorize the withholding of information or limit the availability of records to the public, except as specifically
stated in this section. This section is not authority to withhold information from Congress.
(e)(1) On or before February 1 of each year, each agency shall submit to the Attorney General of the United States and to the Director of
the Office of Government Information Services a report which shall cover the preceding fiscal year and which shall include—
(A) the number of determinations made by the agency not to comply with requests for records made to such agency under
subsection (a) and the reasons for each such determination;
(B)(i) the number of appeals made by persons under subsection (a)(6), the result of such appeals, and the reason for the
action upon each appeal that results in a denial of information; and
(ii) a complete list of all statutes that the agency relies upon to authorize the agency to withhold information under
subsection (b)(3), the number of occasions on which each statute was relied upon, a description of whether a court
has upheld the decision of the agency to withhold information under each such statute, and a concise description of
the scope of any information withheld;
(C) the number of requests for records pending before the agency as of September 30 of the preceding year, and the median
and average number of days that such requests had been pending before the agency as of that date;

(E) the median number of days taken by the agency to process different types of requests, based on the date on which the
requests were received by the agency;
(F) the average number of days for the agency to respond to a request beginning on the date on which the request was
received by the agency, the median number of days for the agency to respond to such requests, and the range in number of
days for the agency to respond to such requests;
(G) based on the number of business days that have elapsed since each request was originally received by the agency—
(i) the number of requests for records to which the agency has responded with a determination within a period up to
and including 20 days, and in 20-day increments up to and including 200 days;
(ii) the number of requests for records to which the agency has responded with a determination within a period
