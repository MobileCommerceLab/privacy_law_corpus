of personal information (including such a law relating to credit
reporting or the use of information held in connection with credit
reporting) and is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

Australian Privacy Principles that regulate the handling of personal
information by organisations by reference to the effect of other laws.

Individuals in non-business capacity
(1) An act done, or practice engaged in, by an organisation that is an

act is done, or the practice is engaged in, other than in the course of
a business carried on by the individual.
Note:

See also section 16 which provides that the Australian Privacy
Principles do not apply for the purposes of, or in connection with, an
individual’s personal, family or household affairs.

Organisation acting under Commonwealth contract
(2) An act done, or practice engaged in, by an organisation is exempt
for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee) if:
(a) the organisation is a contracted service provider for a
Commonwealth contract (whether or not the organisation is a
party to the contract); and
(b) the organisation would be a small business operator if it were

contract; and
(c) the act is done, or the practice is engaged in, otherwise than
for the purposes of meeting (directly or indirectly) an
obligation under a Commonwealth contract for which the
organisation is the contracted service provider.
Note:

This puts the organisation in the same position as a small business
operator as far as its activities that are not for the purposes of a
Commonwealth contract are concerned, so the organisation need not
comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, or a registered APP
code that binds the organisation, in relation to those activities.

Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy
(1) Despite subsection 13(1), each of the following acts or practices of

Note:

Subsection (1) lets related bodies corporate share personal
information. However, in using or holding the information, they must
comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and a registered APP
code that binds them. For example, there is an interference with
privacy if:
(a) a body corporate uses personal information it has collected from
a related body corporate; and
(b) the use breaches Australian Privacy Principle 6 (noting that the
collecting body’s primary purpose of collection will be taken to
be the same as that of the related body).

(a) a related body corporate that is not an organisation; or
(b) a related body corporate whose disclosure of the information

individual under subsection 13(3).

13C Change in partnership because of change in partners
Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy
(1) If:
(a) an organisation (the new partnership) that is a partnership
forms at the same time as, or immediately after, the
dissolution of another partnership (the old partnership); and
(b) at least one person who was a partner in the old partnership is
a partner in the new partnership; and
(c) the new partnership carries on a business that is the same as,
or similar to, a business carried on by the old partnership; and
(d) the new partnership holds, immediately after its formation,
personal information about an individual that the old
partnership held immediately before its dissolution;
neither the disclosure (if any) by the old partnership, nor the
collection (if any) by the new partnership, of the information that
was necessary for the new partnership to hold the information
immediately after its formation constitutes an interference with the
privacy of the individual.
Note:

80
Compilation No. 85

Subsection (1) lets personal information be passed on from an old to a
new partnership. However, in using or holding the information, they
must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and a registered
APP code that binds them. For example, the new partnership’s use of
personal information collected from the old partnership may constitute
an interference with privacy if it breaches Australian Privacy
Principle 6.

develop APP codes, which:
(a)

must set out how one or more of the Australian
Privacy Principles are to be applied or complied
with; and

(b)

may impose additional requirements to those
imposed by the Australian Privacy Principles; and

(c)

may deal with other specified matters.

If the Commissioner includes an APP code on the Codes Register,
an APP entity bound by the code must not breach it. A breach of a
registered APP code is an interference with the privacy of an
individual.
Division 3 deals with a code of practice about credit reporting,
called a CR code. CR code developers or the Commissioner may
develop a CR code, which:

class members.

38A Commissioner may determine that a complaint is not to
continue as a representative complaint
(1) The Commissioner may, on application by the respondent or on his
or her own initiative, determine that a complaint should no longer
continue as a representative complaint.
(2) The Commissioner may only make such a determination if the
Commissioner is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do
so for any of the following reasons:
(a) the costs that would be incurred if the complaint were to
continue as a representative complaint are likely to exceed
the costs that would be incurred if each class member lodged
a separate complaint;
(b) the representative complaint will not provide an efficient and
effective means of dealing with the complaints of the class
members;
(c) the complaint was not brought in good faith as a
representative complaint;
(d) it is otherwise inappropriate that the complaints be pursued
by means of a representative complaint.
(3) If the Commissioner makes such a determination:

complainant on his or her own behalf against the respondent;

the purposes of the former representative complaint, the
Commissioner may join that person as a complainant to the
complaint as continued under paragraph (a).

withdraw from a representative complaint:

member—at any time; or
(b) otherwise—at any time before the Commissioner begins to

relates to a matter, the former member may make a complaint under
section 36 that relates to the matter.

(3) The Commissioner may at any stage direct that notice of any
matter be given to a class member or class members.

38C Amendment of representative complaints
If the Commissioner is satisfied that a complaint could be dealt
with as a representative complaint if the class of persons on whose
behalf the complaint is lodged is increased, reduced or otherwise
altered, the Commissioner may amend the complaint so that the
complaint can be dealt with as a representative complaint.

If an individual, body corporate, partnership, unincorporated

(a) an act or practice of the organisation (while it was an
organisation); and
(b) the individual, body corporate, partnership, unincorporated

of the individual in carrying on the business before he or she

94A Simplified outline of this Part
There are several serious offences relating to COVID app data and
COVIDSafe. They deal with:
•

non-permitted collection, use or disclosure relating to COVID
app data; and

•

uploading COVID app data without consent; and

•

retaining or disclosing uploaded data outside Australia; and

Other specific obligations relate to deletion of data and what is to
happen after the COVIDSafe data period has ended (as determined
by the Health Minister).
The general privacy law provided by this Act is applied to the
requirements of this Part, in particular by:
•

ensuring that COVID app data is taken to be personal
information and breaches of this Part are interferences with
privacy; and

•

enhancing the Commissioner’s role in dealing with eligible
data breaches, making assessments and conducting

•

enabling the Commissioner to refer matters to, and share

•

providing for this Act to apply to State or Territory health
authorities in relation to COVID app data.

This Part imposes on State or Territory health authorities the Act’s
rules and privacy protections, and Commonwealth oversight, in
relation to COVID app data, as Commonwealth property that those
authorities receive.
This Part also cancels the effect of Australian laws that are
inconsistent with the prohibitions in this Part.

94B Object of this Part
The object of this Part is to assist in preventing and controlling the
entry, emergence, establishment or spread of the coronavirus
known as COVID-19 into Australia or any part of Australia by
providing stronger privacy protections for COVID app data and
COVIDSafe users in order to:
(a) encourage public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe; and
(b) enable faster and more effective contact tracing.

94C Constitutional basis of this Part
Principal constitutional basis
(1) This Part relies on the Commonwealth’s legislative powers with
respect to matters that are peculiarly adapted to the government of
a nation and cannot otherwise be carried on for the benefit of the
nation.
