ON
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Since the promulgation of Law Number 3 of 1989 on Telecommunications,
development and telecommunications operations have shown an increasingly
important and strategic role in supporting and sustaining economic activities,
strengthening defense and security, educating the life of the people,
facilitating the Government’s activities, reinforcing the unity and integrity of
the nation in the framework of archipelagic outlook (wawasan nusantara),
and solidifying national resilience as well as promoting interstate relations.
Nevertheless, changes in the global environment and rapid development of
telecommunications technology have brought about profound changes, giving
rise to a new telecommunications environment, including the results of
convergence with broadcasting and information technology. Thus, the
reordering of the operation of national telecommunications is deemed
necessary.
Adjustment to telecommunications operations at the national level has
become a concrete need, given the increased capacity of the private sector in
telecommunications operations, mastery of telecommunications technology,
and competitive edge in an effort to meet the needs of the people.
In the meantime, development of telecommunications technology at the
international level, followed by its increased use as one of the trade
commodities with a high commercial value, has resulted in a host of
multilateral agreements.
As a country that has actively promoted interstate relations on the grounds
