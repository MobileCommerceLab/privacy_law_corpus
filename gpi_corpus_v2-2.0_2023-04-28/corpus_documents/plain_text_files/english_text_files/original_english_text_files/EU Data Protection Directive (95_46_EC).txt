responsibilities
under
Community law; whereas this difference in levels
of protection is due to the existence of a wide
variety of national laws , regulations and
administrative provisions;

( 11 )

23 . 11 . 95

Whereas the principles of the protection of the
rights and freedoms of individuals, notably the
right to privacy, which are contained in this
Directive , give substance to and amplify those
contained in the Council of Europe Convention of
28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals
with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal
Data ;

(8)

Whereas, in order to remove the obstacles to flows

of personal data , the level of protection of the
rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to
the processing of such data must be equivalent in

( 12 )

all Member States ; whereas this objective is vital to
the internal market but cannot be achieved by the
Member States alone, especially in view of the
scale of the divergences which currently exist

of records of addresses;

between the relevant laws in the Member States
and the need to coordinate the laws of the
Member States so as to ensure that the

cross-border flow of personal data is regulated in a
consistent manner that is in keeping with the
objective of the internal market as provided for in
Article 7a of the Treaty; whereas Community
action to approximate those laws is therefore

Whereas the protection principles must apply to all
processing of personal data by any person whose
activities are governed by Community law; whereas
there should be excluded the processing of data
carried out by a natural person in the exercise of
activities which are exclusively personal or
domestic , such as correspondence and the holding

Whereas the activities referred to in Titles V and

prejudice to the obligations incumbent upon

Member States under Article 56 ( 2 ), Article 57 or

( 9)

Whereas , given the equivalent protection resulting
from the approximation of national laws, the
Member States will no longer be able to inhibit the
free movement between them of personal data on
grounds relating to protection of the rights and
freedoms of individuals, and in particular the right
to privacy; whereas Member States will be left a
margin for manoeuvre, which may, in the context
of implementation of the Directive, also be
exercised by the business and social partners;

Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the
European Community ; whereas the processing of
personal data that is necessary to safeguard the
economic well-being of the State does not fall
within the scope of this Directive where such
processing relates to State security matters;

( 14 )

Whereas,
given
the
importance
of the
developments under way, in the framework of the
information society, of the techniques used to
capture, transmit, manipulate, record, store or
communicate sound and image data relating to
natural persons, this Directive should be applicable
to processing involving such data ;

specify in their national law the general conditions
governing the lawfulness of data processing;

their legislation ; whereas, within the limits of this

Community law , disparities could arise in the
implementation of the Directive, and this could

carried out for the purposes of public security,

activities relating to the area of criminal law or of

to privacy, which is recognized both in Article 8 of
the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in

other activities which do not come within the

the general principles of Community law; whereas,
for that reason , the approximation of those laws

down in Article 9 :

not deprived of the protection to which they are
entitled under this Directive, any processing of
personal data in the Community must be carried

of legal persons with regard to the processing data
which concerns them is not affected by this
Directive ;

out in accordance with the law of one of the

Member States; whereas, in this connection ,
processing carried out under the responsibility of a
controller who is established in a Member State

should be governed by the law of that State ;

( 19 ) Whereas establishment on the territory of a
Member State implies the effective and real
exercise of activity through stable arrangements ;
whereas the legal form of such an establishment,
whether simply branch or a subsidiary with a legal
personality, is not the determining factor in this
respect; whereas, when a single controller is
established on the territory of several Member
States, particularly by means of subsidiaries, he
must ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention
of national rules, that each of the establishments
fulfils the obligations imposed by the national law
applicable to its activities;

( 20 )

( 25 ) Whereas the principles of protection must be
reflected , on the one hand , in the obligations
imposed on persons, public authorities, enterprises,
agencies or other bodies responsible for processing,
in particular regarding data quality, technical
security , notification to the supervisory authority ,
and the circumstances under which processing can

be carried out, and , on the other hand , in the right
conferred on individuals , the data on whom are

the subject of processing, to be informed that
processing is taking place, to consult the data, to
request corrections and even to object to
processing in certain circumstances;

( 26 )

Whereas the fact that the processing of data is
carried out by a person established in a third
country must not stand in the way of the
protection of individuals provided for in this
Directive; whereas in these cases, the processing
should be governed by the law of the Member
State in which the means used are located , and

there should be guarantees to ensure that the rights

and obligations provided for in this Directive are
respected in practice;

Whereas the principles of protection must apply to
any information concerning an identified or
identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether
a person is identifiable, account should be taken of
all the means likely reasonably to be used either by
the controller or by any other person to identify
the said person ; whereas the principles of
protection shall not apply to data rendered
anonymous in such a way that the data subject is
no longer identifiable; whereas codes of conduct
within the meaning of Article 27 may be a useful
instrument for providing guidance as to the ways
in which data may be rendered anonymous and
retained in a form in which identification of the

data subject is no longer possible;

( 21 ) Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the
rules of territoriality applicable in criminal
matters ;

( 22 ) Whereas Member States shall more precisely define
in the laws they enact or when bringing into force
the measures taken under this Directive the general
circumstances in which processing is lawful ;
whereas in particular Article 5 , in conjunction with
Articles

7

and

8,

allows

Member

States ,

independently of general rules, to provide for
special processing conditions for specific sectors
and for the various categories of data covered by
Article 8 ;

( 23 )

( 27 )

Whereas the protection of individuals must apply
as much to automatic processing of data as to
manual processing; whereas the scope of this
protection must not in effect depend on the
techniques used , otherwise this would create a
serious
risk
of
circumvention ;
whereas,
nonetheless, as regards manual processing, this
Directive covers only filing systems, not
unstructured files; whereas , in particular, the
content of a filing system must be structured
according to specific criteria relating to individuals
allowing easy access to the personal data; whereas ,

files or sets of files as well as their cover pages,
which are not structured according to specific
criteria , shall under no circumstances fall within

( 32 ) Whereas it is for national legislation to determine
whether the controller performing a task carried
out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority should be a public administration
or another natural or legal person governed by

public law, or by private law such as a professional
association ;

( 28 ) Whereas any processing of personal data must be
lawful and fair to the individuals concerned;
whereas , in particular, the data must be adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the

purposes for which they are processed; whereas
such purposes must be explicit and legitimate and
must be determined at the time of collection of the

data ; whereas the purposes of processing further to
collection shall not be incompatible with the
purposes as they were originally specified ;

( 29 ) Whereas the further processing of personal data
for historical , statistical or scientific purposes is
not generally to be considered incompatible with
the purposes for which the data have previously
been collected provided that Member States furnish
suitable safeguards; whereas these safeguards must
in particular rule out the use of the data in support
of measures or decisions regarding any particular

( 33 ) Whereas data which are capable by their nature of
infringing fundamental freedoms or privacy should
not be processed unless the data subject gives his
explicit consent; whereas, however, derogations
from this prohibition must be explicitly provided
for in respect of specific needs, in particular where
the processing of these data is carried out for
certain health-related purposes by persons subject
to a legal obligation of professional secrecy or in
the course of legitimate activities by certain
associations or foundations the purpose of which is
to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms ;

( 34 )

when justified by grounds of important public
interest, to derogate from the prohibition on
processing sensitive categories of data where
important reasons of public interest so justify in
areas such as public health and social protection especially in order to ensure the quality and
cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for
settling claims for benefits and services in the

individual ;

( 30 )

Whereas, in order to be lawful, the processing of
personal data must in addition be carried out with
the consent of the data subject or be necessary for
the conclusion or performance of a contract
binding on the data subject, or as a legal
requirement, or for the performance of a task
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
of official authority, or in the legitimate interests of

therefore lay down exemptions and derogations
necessary for the purpose of balance between
fundamental rights as regards general measures on
the legitimacy of data processing, measures on the
transfer of data to third countries and the power
of the supervisory authority; whereas this should
not, however , lead Member States to lay down
exemptions from the measures to ensure security of
processing; whereas at least the supervisory
authority responsible for this sector should also be
provided with certain ex-post powers, e.g. to
publish a regular report or to refer matters to the
judicial authorities;

Whereas Member States may, in the interest of the
data subject or so as to protect the rights and
freedoms of others, restrict rights of access and
information; whereas they may, for example,
specify that access to medical data may be
obtained only through a health professional ;

(43 )

Whereas restrictions on the rights of access and
information and on certain obligations of the
controller may similarly be imposed by Member
States in so far as they are necessary to safeguard,
for example, national security, defence, public
safety , or important economic or financial interests

Whereas, if the processing of data is to be fair, the
data subject must be in a position to learn of the
existence of a processing operation and, where
data are collected from him , must be given
accurate and full information , bearing in mind the
circumstances of the collection;

of a Member State or the Union, as well as

three areas does not affect the legitimacy of

were collected from the data subject; whereas, in
all these cases , the data subject should be informed
when the data are recorded or at the latest when

the data are first disclosed to a third party;

( 44 )
(40 )

Whereas, however, it is not necessary to impose

this obligation of the data subject already has the
information; whereas , moreover, there will be no

such obligation if the recording or disclosure are

Whereas Member States may also be led , by virtue
of the provisions of Community law, to derogate

from the provisions of this Directive concerning
the right of access, the obligation to inform
individuals, and the quality of data , in order to
secure certain of the purposes referred to above;

expressly provided for by law or if the provision of
information to the data subject proves impossible
or would involve disproportionate efforts, which
could be the case where processing is for historical ,
statistical or scientific purposes; whereas, in this
regard, the number of data subjects, the age of the
data , and any compensatory measures adopted
may be taken into consideration ;

(41 ) Whereas any person must be able to exercise the
right of access to data relating to him which are
being processed , in order to verify in particular the
accuracy of the data and the lawfulness of the
processing; whereas , for the same reasons, every
data subject must also have the right to know the
logic involved in the automatic processing of data

( 45 ) Whereas, in cases where data might lawfully be
processed on grounds of public interest, official
authority or the legitimate interests of a natural or
legal person, any data subject should nevertheless
be entitled, on legitimate and compelling grounds
relating to his particular situation , to object to the

processing of any data relating to himself; whereas
Member States may nevertheless lay down national
provisions to the contrary ;

( 46 ) Whereas the protection of the rights and freedoms
of data subjects with regard to the processing of
personal data requires that appropriate technical

and organizational measures be taken, both at the
time of the design of the processing system and at
the time of the processing itself, particularly in
order to maintain security and thereby to prevent
any unauthorized processing; whereas it is

( 51 ) Whereas, nevertheless , simplification or exemption
from the obligation to notify shall not release the
controller from any of the other obligations
resulting from this Directive;

incumbent on the Member States to ensure that

controllers comply with these measures; whereas
these measures must ensure an appropriate level of
security, taking into account the state of the art
and the costs of their implementation in relation to
the risks inherent in the processing and the nature
of the data to be protected ;

( 47)

(48 )

Whereas where a message containing personal data
is transmitted by means of a telecommunications
or electronic mail service, the sole purpose of
which is the transmission of such messages, the
controller in respect of the personal data contained
in the message will normally be considered to be
the person from whom the message originates,
rather than the person offering the transmission
services; whereas, nevertheless, those offering such
services will normally be considered controllers in
respect of the processing of the additional personal
data necessary for the operation of the service;

( 52 )

considered a sufficient measure;

( 53 )

Whereas, however, certain processing operation are
likely to pose specific risks to the rights and
freedoms of data subjects by virtue of their nature,
their scope or their purposes, such as that of
excluding individuals from a right, benefit or a
contract, or by virtue of the specific use of new
technologies ; whereas it is for Member States, if
they so wish , to specify such risks in their
legislation ;

(54 )

Whereas with regard to all the processing
undertaken in society, the amount posing such
specific risks should be very limited ; whereas
Member States must provide that the supervisory
authority, or the data protection official in
cooperation with the authority, check such
processing prior to it being carried out; whereas
following this prior check, the supervisory
authority may , according to its national law, give
an opinion or an authorization regarding the
processing; whereas such checking may equally
take place in the course of the preparation either of
a measure of the national parliament or of a
measure based on such a legislative measure, which
defines the nature of the processing and lays down
appropriate safeguards ;

( 55 )

Whereas, if the controller fails to respect the rights
of data subjects, national legislation must provide
for a judicial remedy ; whereas any damage which a
person may suffer as a result of unlawful
processing must be compensated for by the
controller , who may be exempted from liability if
he proves that he is not responsible for the
damage , in particular in cases where he establishes
fault on the part of the data subject or in case of
force majeure ; whereas sanctions must be imposed
on any person, whether governed by private of
public law, who fails to comply with the national

protection afforded by a third country must be
assessed in the light of all the circumstances
surrounding the transfer operation or set of

means to perform their duties , including powers of

of complaints from individuals, and powers to

jurisdiction they fall ;

Whereas provisions should be made for
exemptions from this prohibition in certain
circumstances where the data subject has given his
consent, where the transfer is necessary in relation
to a contract or a legal claim , where protection of
an important public interest so requires, for
example in cases of international transfers of data
between

tax

or

customs

administrations

or

between services competent for social security
matters , or where the transfer is made from a

register established by law and intended for
consultation by the public or persons having a
legitimate interest; whereas in this case such a
transfer should not involve the entirety of the data
or entire categories of the data contained in the
register and , when the register is intended for
consultation by persons having a legitimate
interest, the transfer should be made only at the
request of those persons or if they are to be the

their duties so as to ensure that the rules of

protection are properly respected throughout the
European Union ;

regarding the protection of the rights and freedoms
of individuals , notably their right to privacy, with

of this Directive, taking account of the specific
characteristics of the processing carried out in
certain sectors, and respecting the national
provisions adopted for its implementation ;
