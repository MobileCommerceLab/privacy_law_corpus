(1) If a third party is unable to agree with the provider on one or more
aspects of access to a declared service, either the provider or the
third party may notify the Commission in writing that an access
dispute exists, but only to the extent that those aspects of access are
not the subject of an access undertaking that is in operation in
relation to the service.
Note:

An example of one of the things on which a provider and third party
might disagree is whether a previous determination ought to be varied.

(1) The Commission must not make a determination that would have
any of the following effects:
(a) preventing an existing user obtaining a sufficient amount of
the service to be able to meet the user’s reasonably
anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the
dispute was notified;
(b) preventing a person from obtaining, by the exercise of a
pre-notification right, a sufficient amount of the service to be
able to meet the person’s actual requirements;
(c) depriving any person of a protected contractual right;
(d) resulting in the third party becoming the owner (or one of the
owners) of any part of the facility, or of extensions of the
facility (including expansions of the capacity of the facility
and expansions of the geographical reach of the facility),
without the consent of the provider;
(e) requiring the provider to bear some or all of the costs of
extending the facility (including expanding the capacity of
the facility and expanding the geographical reach of the
facility);
(ea) requiring the provider to bear some or all of the costs of
maintaining extensions of the facility (including expansions
of the capacity of the facility and expansions of the
geographical reach of the facility);

(3) A determination is of no effect if it is made in contravention of
subsection (1).
(4) If the Commission makes a determination that has the effect of
depriving a person (the second person) of a pre-notification right
to require the provider to supply the service to the second person,
the determination must also require the third party:
(a) to pay to the second person such amount (if any) as the
Commission considers is fair compensation for the
deprivation; and
(b) to reimburse the provider and the Commonwealth for any
compensation that the provider or the Commonwealth agrees,
or is required by a court order, to pay to the second party as
compensation for the deprivation.
Note:

Without infringing paragraph (1)(b), a determination may deprive a
second person of the right to be supplied with an amount of service
equal to the difference between the total amount of service the person
was entitled to under a pre-notification right and the amount that the
person actually needs to meet his or her actual requirements.

(4A) If an application for review of a declaration of a service has been
made under subsection 44K(1), the Commission must not make a
determination in relation to the service until the Tribunal has made

service or services that is at least sufficient to meet the
efficient costs of providing access to the regulated
service or services; and

regulatory and commercial risks involved; and
(b) that the access price structures should:
(i) allow multi-part pricing and price discrimination when
it aids efficiency; and
(ii) not allow a vertically integrated access provider to set
terms and conditions that discriminate in favour of its
downstream operations, except to the extent that the
cost of providing access to other operators is higher; and
(c) that access pricing regimes should provide incentives to
reduce costs or otherwise improve productivity.

(2) Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function or
power, or the imposition of a duty, by a law of a State or Territory
to the extent to which:
(a) the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would
contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties
that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal; or
(b) the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative
power of the Commonwealth.
(3) The Commission or Tribunal cannot perform a duty or function, or
exercise a power, under a State or Territory access regime law
unless the conferral of the function or power, or the imposition of
the duty, is in accordance with an agreement between the
Commonwealth and the State or Territory concerned.

Section 44ZZMAA
44ZZMAA No merits review by Tribunal of decisions under energy
laws
(1) This section applies if a State/Territory energy law or the
Australian Energy Market Act 2004 purports to confer a function
or power, or to impose a duty, in relation to a decision made under:
(a) a State/Territory energy law; or
(b) a uniform energy law applied as a law of the Commonwealth
under the Australian Energy Market Act 2004.
However, this section does not apply in relation to a decision
relating to the disclosure of confidential or protected information
under such a law.
(2) The purported conferral or imposition has no effect to the extent to
which it would require or permit merits review (however
described) of the decision by the Tribunal.
(3) This section applies despite anything in any law of the
Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

44ZZMA How duty is imposed
Application
(1) This section applies if a State or Territory access regime law
purports to impose a duty on the Commission or Tribunal.
Note 1:

Section 44ZZMB sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the
Commission or Tribunal.

Note 2:

Section 320 of the South Australian Energy Retail Legislation, as it
applies as a law of a State or Territory, deals with the case where a
duty purportedly imposed on a Commonwealth body under that
applied law cannot be imposed by the State or Territory or the
Commonwealth due to constitutional doctrines restricting such duties.

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty
(2) The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law
of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

Section 44ZZMB
(a) imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State
or Territory concerned; and
(b) imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is
consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the
duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal.
Note:

If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by
force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having
consented under section 44ZZM to the imposition of the duty by that
law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but
State or Territory legislative powers are not
(3) If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it
is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the
Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory),
the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary
to ensure that validity.
(4) If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it
is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to
it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by
this Act.
(5) The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with
subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:
(a) is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and
(b) is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the
duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal.
(6) Subsections (1) to (5) do not limit section 44ZZM.

44ZZMB When a law of a State or Territory imposes a duty
For the purposes of sections 44ZZM and 44ZZMA, a State or
Territory access regime law imposes a duty on the Commission or
Tribunal if:
(a) the law confers a function or power on the Commission or
Tribunal; and

the Commonwealth must pay that person:
(c) a reasonable amount of compensation agreed on between the

Meaning of industrial action—basic definition
(4) In subsection (3), industrial action means:
(a) the performance of work in a manner different from that in
which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a
practice in relation to work, the result of which is a restriction
or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work,
where:
(i) the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed,
wholly or partly, by a workplace instrument or an order
of an industrial body; or
(ii) the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in
connection with an industrial dispute; or
(b) a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or
on acceptance of or offering for work, in accordance with the
terms and conditions prescribed by a workplace instrument or
by an order of an industrial body; or
(c) a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or
on acceptance of or offering for work, that is adopted in
connection with an industrial dispute; or
(d) a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work or a failure
or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend
for work.
For this purpose, industrial body and workplace instrument have
the same meanings as in the Fair Work Act 2009.
Meaning of industrial action—further clarification
(5) For the purposes of subsection (3):
(a) conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the
conduct relates to part only of the duties that persons are
required to perform in the course of their employment; and

(1) A designated sector means a sector of the Australian economy
designated under subsection (2).
(2) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, designate a sector of
the Australian economy by specifying:
(a) classes of information (the designated information); and
(b) persons who hold one or more specified classes of the
designated information (or on whose behalf such information
is held); and
(c) the earliest day (the earliest holding day) applicable to the
sector for holding the designated information; and
(d) each of the classes of information within the designated
information for which a person may charge a fee if:
(i) the person is required under the consumer data rules to
disclose information within that class to another person
in specified circumstances; or
(ii) another person uses information within that class in
specified circumstances as the result of a disclosure

(iii) a designated gateway for CDR data;
to do or not to do specified things when acting on behalf of
the CDR entity and within the agent’s actual or apparent
authority;
(j) rules about any other matters that the provisions of this Part
provide may be specified, or otherwise dealt with, in the
consumer data rules.

56BK Further limitations on the consumer data rules
(1) The consumer data rules cannot impose on a person a requirement
that has a retrospective commencement or application.
Example: The rules cannot require a data holder to disclose CDR data on a day
before the rules are registered, or on a day before the registration of a
variation to the rules that includes the requirement.
Note:

Other limitations on the consumer data rules are in sections 56BD,
56BF and 56BG.

(2) To avoid doubt, the consumer data rules may require a person to do
something on a particular day, in relation to CDR data generated or
collected on an earlier day, if the person:
(a) is a data holder of the CDR data; or
(b) is an accredited person; or
(c) is a person who has given a valid request under the consumer
data rules relating to the CDR data; or
(d) is a designated gateway for the CDR data.
Example: A data holder is given a valid request to disclose CDR data that was
generated before the rules are registered. The rules can require that
disclosure.

Division 5 Privacy safeguards

Section 56EA

Division 5—Privacy safeguards
Subdivision A—Preliminary
56EA Simplified outline
This Division sets out privacy safeguards that protect the privacy
or confidentiality of CDR consumers’ CDR data, whether the CDR
consumers are individuals or bodies corporate.
The privacy safeguards apply mainly to accredited persons, but
also to data holders and designated gateways, in relation to their
handling or future handling of the CDR data.
A person’s failure to comply with any of these safeguards may lead
to consequences, including liability to a civil penalty (see
Subdivision G) or the suspension or revocation of the person’s
accreditation (see subsection 56BH(3)).

56EB Kinds of CDR data to which the privacy safeguards apply
(1) The privacy safeguards only apply to CDR data for which there are
one or more CDR consumers.
Note:

One requirement for CDR data to have a CDR consumer is that there
needs to be at least one person who is identifiable, or reasonably
identifiable, from the CDR data or from related information (see
paragraph 56AI(3)(c)).

(2) The privacy safeguards apply to CDR data whether the CDR data
is true or not.

56EC Relationship with other laws
Relationship with the consumer data rules
(1) If there is an inconsistency between the privacy safeguards and the
consumer data rules, those safeguards prevail over those rules to
the extent of the inconsistency.
(2) However, the consumer data rules are taken to be consistent with
the privacy safeguards to the extent that they are capable of
operating concurrently.
Note:

This means that the privacy safeguards do not cover the field that they
deal with.

Relationship with the Privacy Act 1988
(3) This Division does not limit Part IIIA (about credit reporting) of
the Privacy Act 1988. However, the regulations may declare that in
specified circumstances that Part applies in relation to CDR data as
if specified provisions of that Part were omitted, modified or varied
as specified in the declaration.
(4) Despite the Privacy Act 1988:
(a) the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply to an
accredited data recipient of CDR data in relation to the CDR
data; and
(aa) if section 56ED, 56EE, 56EF or 56EG applies to an
accredited person in relation to CDR data—the
corresponding Australian Privacy Principle does not apply to
the accredited person in relation to the CDR data; and
(b) if subsection 56EN(1) applies to a disclosure of CDR data by
a data holder of the CDR data—Australian Privacy
Principle 10 does not apply to the data holder in relation to
that disclosure of the CDR data; and
(c) if subsection 56EP(1) applies to CDR data and a data holder
of the CDR data—Australian Privacy Principle 13 does not
apply to the data holder in relation to the CDR data; and

Note 1:

For the accredited data recipient, the privacy safeguards will apply
instead.

Note 2:

Section 56EN (or privacy safeguard 11) is about the quality of CDR
data. Section 56EP (or privacy safeguard 13) is about correcting CDR
data.

(5) Apart from paragraphs (4)(aa) to (d), this Division does not affect
how the Australian Privacy Principles apply to:
(aa) an accredited person who does not become an accredited data
recipient of the CDR data; or
(a) a data holder of CDR data in relation to the CDR data; or
(b) a designated gateway for CDR data in relation to the CDR
data.
Note 1:

Privacy safeguard 1 will apply to a data holder or designated gateway
in parallel to Australian Privacy Principle 1.

Note 2:

The consumer data rules (which are made under Division 2) will
affect how the Australian Privacy Principles apply. Requirements and
authorisations under those rules will be requirements or authorisations
under an Australian law for the purposes of the Australian Privacy
Principles.

(a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started
against the person for an offence; and
(b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the
same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.
The proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order may be resumed if
the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the
proceedings are dismissed.
(4) Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct
that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a

92 regardless of whether a pecuniary penalty order has been made
against the person in respect of the contravention.
(5) Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of

the order was made); and
(b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially
the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the
contravention.
However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of
the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the
proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.

87CF Contribution not recoverable from defendant
A defendant against whom judgment is given under this Part as a
concurrent wrongdoer in relation to an apportionable claim:
(a) cannot be required to contribute to any damages or
contribution recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer in
respect of the apportionable claim (whether or not the
damages or contribution are recovered in the same
proceedings in which judgment is given against the
defendant); and
(b) cannot be required to indemnify any such wrongdoer.

87CG Subsequent actions
(1) In relation to an apportionable claim, nothing in this Part or any
other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered
judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part
of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any
other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss.
(2) However, in any proceedings in respect of any such action, the
plaintiff cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard
to any damages previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of
the damage or loss, would result in the plaintiff receiving
compensation for damage or loss that is greater than the damage or
loss actually sustained by the plaintiff.

87CH Joining non-party concurrent wrongdoer in the action
(1) The court may give leave for any one or more persons to be joined
as defendants in proceedings involving an apportionable claim.

Preliminary Division 1

Section 10.01

Part X—International liner cargo shipping
Division 1—Preliminary
10.01 Objects of Part
(1) The principal objects of this Part are:
(a) to ensure that Australian exporters have continued access to
outwards liner cargo shipping services of adequate frequency
and reliability at freight rates that are internationally
competitive; and
(b) to promote conditions in the international liner cargo
shipping industry that encourage stable access to export
markets for exporters in all States and Territories; and
(c) to ensure that efficient Australian flag shipping is not
unreasonably hindered from normal commercial participation
in any outwards liner cargo shipping trade; and
(d) as far as practicable, to extend to Australian importers in each
State and Territory the protection given by this Part to
Australian exporters.
(2) It is the intention of the Parliament that the principal objects of this
Part should be achieved:
(a) by permitting continued conference operations while
enhancing the competitive environment for international liner
cargo shipping services through the provision of adequate
and appropriate safeguards against abuse of conference
power, particularly by:
(i) enacting additional restrictive trade practice provisions
applying to ocean carriers;
(ii) requiring conference agreements to meet certain
minimum standards;
(iii) making conference agreements generally publicly
available;

Part X International liner cargo shipping
Division 1 Preliminary

Section 10.01A
(iv) permitting only partial and conditional exemption from
restrictive trade practice prohibitions; and
(v) requiring conferences to take part in negotiations with
representative shipper bodies;
(b) through increased reliance on private commercial and legal
processes and a reduced level of government regulation of
routine commercial matters; and
(c) by the exercise of jurisdiction, consistent with international
law:
(i) over ocean carriers who have a substantial connection
with Australia because they provide international liner
cargo shipping services; and
(ii) to enable remedies for contravention of the provisions
of this Part to be enforced within Australia.

10.01A Simplified outline
The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

•

This Part sets up a system for regulating international liner
cargo shipping services.

•

The main components of that system are as follows:

•

2
Compilation No. 132

(a)

registration of conference agreements;

(b)

regulation of non-conference ocean carriers with
substantial market power;

(c)

regulation of unfair pricing practices;

(d)

registration of agents of ocean carriers.

The parties to a conference agreement relating to international
liner cargo shipping services may apply for the registration of
the agreement.

International liner cargo shipping Part X
Preliminary Division 1

Section 10.02

•

If the conference agreement is registered, the parties will be
given partial and conditional exemptions from:
(a)

sections 45AF, 45AG, 45AJ and 45AK (cartel
conduct); and

(b)

section 45 (contracts etc. that restrict dealings or
affect competition); and

(c)

section 47 (exclusive dealing).

•

The parties to a registered conference agreement are required
to negotiate with, and provide information to, representative
shipper bodies.

•

The Commission may investigate whether grounds exist for
the Minister to deregister a conference agreement.

•

The main ground for deregistration is a breach by the parties
to the agreement of requirements imposed on them by this
Part.

10.02 Interpretation
(1) In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:
agreement means any contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, whether made in or outside Australia.

(1) A professional standards law of a State or Territory applies to limit
occupational liability relating to an action for a contravention of
section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law in the same way as it
limits occupational liability arising under a law of the State or
Territory.
(2) However, the professional standards law applies for that purpose:
(a) only in relation to a scheme that was prescribed by the
regulations at the time (the contravention time) of the
contravention; and
(b) as if the scheme were in force under that law at the
contravention time, in the form the scheme would have been
in if:
(i) the scheme had not been amended or revoked under that
law since the scheme was first prescribed; and
(ii) any additions, omissions, substitutions and other
modifications prescribed by the regulations at the
contravention time had been made to the scheme.
Operation of choice of law rules
(3) For the purposes of working out whether a professional standards
law of a particular State or Territory applies under subsection (1) in
relation to a particular contravention of section 18 of the Australian
Consumer Law, choice of law rules operate in relation to the
contravention in the same way as they operate in relation to a tort.

(a) an act or omission of:
(i) the individual who suffers the injuries referred to in that

(a) a carrier; or
(b) a carriage service provider;
is said to engage in anti-competitive conduct for the purposes of
this Part.
(2) A carrier or carriage service provider engages in anti-competitive
conduct if the carrier or carriage service provider:
(a) has a substantial degree of power in a telecommunications
market; and
(b) either:
(i) takes advantage of that power in that or any other
market with the effect, or likely effect, of substantially
lessening competition in that or any other

152BDA Restrictions on binding rules of conduct
(1) The Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that
would have any of the following effects:
(a) preventing a service provider who already has access to the
declared service from obtaining a sufficient amount of the
service to be able to meet the service provider’s reasonably
anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the
access seeker made a request in relation to the service under
section 152AR or 152AXB;
(b) preventing a carrier or carriage service provider from
obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to
meet the carrier’s or provider’s reasonably anticipated
requirements, measured at the time when the access seeker
made a request in relation to the service under section 152AR
or 152AXB;
(c) preventing a person from obtaining, by the exercise of a
pre-rules right, a sufficient level of access to the declared
service to be able to meet the person’s actual requirements;
(d) depriving any person of a protected contractual right;
(e) resulting in an access seeker becoming the owner (or one of
the owners) of any part of a facility without the consent of
the owner of the facility;
(f) requiring a person (other than an access seeker) to bear an
unreasonable amount of the costs of:
(i) extending or enhancing the capability of a facility; or
(ii) maintaining extensions to or enhancements of the
capability of a facility;
(g) requiring a carrier or carriage service provider to provide an
access seeker with access to a declared service if there are
reasonable grounds to believe that:
(i) the access seeker would fail, to a material extent, to
comply with the terms and conditions on which the
carrier or provider provides, or is reasonably likely to
provide, that access; or

(ii) the access seeker would fail, in connection with that
access, to protect the integrity of a telecommunications
network or to protect the safety of individuals working
on, or using services supplied by means of, a
telecommunications network or a facility.
(2) Examples of grounds for believing as mentioned in
subparagraph (1)(g)(i) include:
(a) evidence that the access seeker is not creditworthy; and
(b) repeated failures by the access seeker to comply with the
terms and conditions on which the same or similar access has
been provided (whether or not by the carrier or carriage

inconsistent with any of the standard access obligations that are, or
will be, applicable to a carrier or carriage service provider.

binding rules of conduct that would have the effect of requiring
Telstra to engage in conduct in connection with matters covered by
the final migration plan.
(3B) The Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that
would have the effect of:
(a) requiring an NBN corporation to engage in conduct that is
inconsistent with conduct authorised under
subsection 151DA(2) or (3) for the purposes of
subsection 51(1); or
(b) preventing an NBN corporation from giving a refusal that is
authorised under subsection 151DA(3) for the purposes of
subsection 51(1).

Section 152BDA
(3D) In subsection (3C), eligible services, uniform national pricing and
utilities have the same meaning as in section 151DA.
(4) If the Commission makes binding rules of conduct that have the
effect of depriving a person (the second person) of a pre-rules right
to require the carrier or provider to provide access to the declared
service to the second person, the rules must also require the access
seeker:
(a) to pay to the second person such amount (if any) as the
Commission considers is fair compensation for the
deprivation; and
(b) to reimburse the carrier or provider and the Commonwealth
for any compensation that the carrier or provider or the
Commonwealth agrees, or is required by a court order, to pay
to the second person as compensation for the deprivation.
(4A) The Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that:
(a) relate to any or all of the category B standard access
obligations applicable to an NBN corporation; and
(b) have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of discriminating
between access seekers.
Note:

For explanatory material, see section 152CJH.

(4B) Subsection (4A) does not prevent discrimination against an access
seeker if the Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that
the access seeker would fail, to a material extent, to comply with
the terms and conditions on which the NBN corporation complies,
or on which the NBN corporation is reasonably likely to comply,
with the relevant obligation.
(4C) Examples of grounds for believing as mentioned in subsection (4B)
include:
(a) evidence that the access seeker is not creditworthy; and
(b) repeated failures by the access seeker to comply with the
terms and conditions on which the same or similar access has
been provided (whether or not by the NBN corporation).

Section 24
24 Meaning of unfair
(1) A term of a consumer contract or small business contract is unfair
if:
(a) it would cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights
and obligations arising under the contract; and
(b) it is not reasonably necessary in order to protect the
legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by
the term; and
(c) it would cause detriment (whether financial or otherwise) to a
party if it were to be applied or relied on.
(2) In determining whether a term of a contract is unfair under
subsection (1), a court may take into account such matters as it
thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:
(a) the extent to which the term is transparent;
(b) the contract as a whole.
(3) A term is transparent if the term is:
(a) expressed in reasonably plain language; and
(b) legible; and
(c) presented clearly; and
(d) readily available to any party affected by the term.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a term of a contract is
presumed not to be reasonably necessary in order to protect the
legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the
term, unless that party proves otherwise.

25 Examples of unfair terms
Without limiting section 24, the following are examples of the
kinds of terms of a consumer contract or small business contract

(c) no matter who is to make introductions to the scheme of
further new participants.
(4) A scheme may be a pyramid scheme even if it has any or all of the
following characteristics:
(a) the participation payments may (or must) be made after the
new participants begin to take part in the scheme;
(b) making a participation payment is not the only requirement
for taking part in the scheme;
(c) the holding out of the prospect of entitlement to recruitment
payments does not give any new participant a legally
enforceable right;

relationship to the value of the goods or services that
participants are entitled to be supplied with under the scheme
(as assessed, if appropriate, by reference to the price of
comparable goods or services available elsewhere);

available to the public if:
(i) a time is specified in the catalogue as the time after
which the goods will not be sold at that price and that
time has not passed; or
(ii) in any other case—the catalogue may reasonably be
regarded as not out-of-date; or

(a) the price or representation is wholly obscured by another
such price or representation that is written, stamped or
located wholly over that price or representation; or
(b) the price or representation:
(i) is expressed as a price per unit of mass, volume, length

Example 1: An airline advertises a flight for sale. Persons have the option of
paying for a carbon offset. If the carbon offset is preselected on the
airline’s online booking system, the single price for the flight must
include the carbon offset charge. This is because the person has not, at
or before the time of the representation, deselected the charge on the
online booking site. If the person deselects the optional carbon offset
charge later in the online booking process, the single price does not
need to include the carbon offset charge after the charge is deselected
because of the exception provided by paragraphs (a)(i) and (ii).
Example 2: The GST may be an example of an amount covered by paragraph (b).
Example 3: The passenger movement charge imposed under the Passenger
Movement Charge Act 1978 may be an example of an amount covered

Division 2—Unsolicited consumer agreements
Subdivision A—Introduction
69 Meaning of unsolicited consumer agreement
(1) An agreement is an unsolicited consumer agreement if:
(a) it is for the supply, in trade or commerce, of goods or
services to a consumer; and
(b) it is made as a result of negotiations between a dealer and the
consumer:
(i) in each other’s presence at a place other than the
business or trade premises of the supplier of the goods
or services; or
(ii) by telephone;
whether or not they are the only negotiations that precede the
making of the agreement; and
(c) the consumer did not invite the dealer to come to that place,
or to make a telephone call, for the purposes of entering into
negotiations relating to the supply of those goods or services
(whether or not the consumer made such an invitation in
relation to a different supply); and
(d) the total price paid or payable by the consumer under the
agreement:
(i) is not ascertainable at the time the agreement is made;
or
(ii) if it is ascertainable at that time—is more than $100 or
such other amount prescribed by the regulations.
(1AA) To avoid doubt, a place mentioned in subsection (1)(b)(i) may be a
public place, and need not be a place the dealer cannot enter
without the consumer’s consent or invitation.

predominant purpose of entering into negotiations relating to
the supply of the goods or services referred to in
subsection (1)(c); or
(b) contacted the dealer in connection with an unsuccessful
attempt by the dealer to contact the consumer.
(2) An invitation merely to quote a price for a supply is not taken, for
the purposes of subsection (1)(c), to be an invitation to enter into
negotiations for a supply.
(3) An agreement is also an unsolicited consumer agreement if it is an
agreement of a kind that the regulations provide are unsolicited
consumer agreements.

relation to a consumer protection breach are stayed if:
(a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started
against the person for an offence; and
(b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the

to in subsection (1)(a) of that section; or
(b) engaged in conduct referred to in subsection (1)(b), (c), (d),
(e) or (f) of that section that relates to a contravention of such
a provision;
but that the person acted honestly and reasonably and, having
regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be
excused, the court may relieve the person either wholly or partly
from liability to a pecuniary penalty under that section.

227 Preference must be given to compensation for victims

(a) it is appropriate to order a person (the defendant) to pay a
pecuniary penalty under section 224 in relation to:
(i) a contravention of a provision referred to in
subsection (1)(a) of that section; or
(ii) conduct referred to in subsection (1)(b), (c), (d), (e) or

(b) it is appropriate to order the defendant to pay compensation
to a person who has suffered loss or damage as result of that
contravention or conduct; and
(c) the defendant does not have sufficient financial resources to
pay both the pecuniary penalty and the compensation;
the court must give preference to making an order for
compensation.
