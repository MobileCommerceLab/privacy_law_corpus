Data Importer to indicate which option it selects: ………………………
Initials of Data Importer: …………………………………………………; and

(i)

it will promptly notify the Data Exporter about–
any legally binding request for disclosure of the Personal Data by a law
enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition
under the criminal law of any jurisdiction outside the Abu Dhabi Global
Market to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation;
any accidental or unauthorised access; and
any request received directly from the Data Subjects without responding to
that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so.

(2)

The Data Importer warrants and undertakes that it will not disclose or transfer the Personal
Data to a third party data controller located outside the Abu Dhabi Global Market unless it
notifies the Data Exporter about the transfer and–

14

the third party data controller processes the Personal Data in accordance
with a Registrar decision finding that a jurisdiction outside the Abu Dhabi
Global Market provides adequate protection;
the third party data controller becomes a signatory to these Clauses or
another data transfer agreement approved by the Registrar;
Data Subjects have been given the opportunity to object, after having been
informed of the purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and
the fact that the jurisdictions to which data is exported may have different
data protection standards; or
with regard to onward transfers of Sensitive Personal Data, Data Subjects
have given their consent to the onward transfer.
4.

Third Party rights

(1)

Unless expressly provided to the contrary in these Clauses, a person who is not a Party has
no right under the Third Parties Act to enforce or to enjoy the benefit of any provision of
these Clauses.

(2)

Notwithstanding any provision of these Clauses, the consent of any person who is not a
Party is not required to rescind or vary these Clauses at any time.

(3)

Any Data Subject may rely on and enforce any provision of these Clauses which expressly
confers rights on it against the Data Importer or Data Exporter.

(4)

The Parties do not object to a Data Subject being represented by an association or other
body if the Data Subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by relevant national law.

5.

Liability

(5)

Each Party shall be liable to the other Parties for damages it causes by any breach of these
Clauses. Liability as between the Parties is limited to actual damage suffered. Punitive
damages (i.e. damages intended to punish a Party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically
excluded.

(6)

Each Party shall be liable to Data Subjects for damages it causes by any breach of Third Party
rights under these Clauses. This does not affect the liability of the Data Exporter under the
Regulations.

(7)

In cases involving allegations of breach by the Data Importer, the Data Subject must first
request the Data Exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against the Data
Importer; if the Data Exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which
under normal circumstances would be one month), the Data Subject may then enforce his
rights against the Data Importer directly. A Data Subject is entitled to proceed directly
against a Data Exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the Data
Importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these Clauses (the Data Exporter shall
have the burden to prove that it took reasonable efforts).

6.

Law applicable to the Clauses

These clauses shall be governed by the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.

15

7.

Resolution of disputes with Data Subjects or the Registrar

(1)

In the event of a dispute or claim brought by a Data Subject or the Registrar concerning the
Processing of the Personal Data against either or both of the Parties, the Parties will inform
each other about any such disputes or claims, and will cooperate with a view to settling
them amicably in a timely fashion.

(2)

The Parties agree to respond to any generally available non‐binding mediation procedure
initiated by a Data Subject or by the Registrar. If they do participate in the proceedings, the
Parties may elect to do so remotely (such as by telephone or other electronic means). The
Parties also agree to consider participating in any other arbitration, mediation or other
dispute resolution proceedings developed for data protection disputes.

(3)

Each Party shall abide by a decision of the Court.

(4)

The Parties agree that the Registrar has the right to exercise its functions and powers
outlined in section 14 of the Regulations in respect of the Data Importer, in the same scope
and subject to the same conditions as would apply the to Data Exporter under the
Regulations.

8.

Termination

(1)

In the event that the Data Importer is in breach of its obligations under these Clauses, then
the Data Exporter may temporarily suspend the transfer of Personal Data to the Data
Importer until the breach is repaired or the contract is terminated.

(2)

In the event that–
(a)

the transfer of Personal Data to the Data Importer has been temporarily suspended
by the Data Exporter for longer than one month pursuant to sub‐clause (1);

(b)

compliance by the Data Importer with these Clauses would put it in breach of its
legal or regulatory obligations in the jurisdiction of import;

(c)

the Data Importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or
undertakings given by it under these Clauses;

(d)

a final decision of the Court or a decision of the Registrar rules that there has been a
breach of the Clauses by the Data Importer or the Data Exporter; or

(e)

a petition is presented for the administration or winding‐up of the Data Importer,
which is not dismissed within the applicable period for such dismissal under the
Insolvency Regulations 2015, a winding‐up order is made, a receiver is appointed
over any of its assets, a trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, a company voluntary
arranagement is commenced by it, or any equivalent event in any jurisdiction
occurs,

then the Data Exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the
Data Importer, shall be entitled to terminate these Clauses, in which case the Registrar shall
be informed where required. In cases covered by (a), (b), or (d) above, the Data Importer
may also terminate these Clauses.

16

(3)

Either Party may terminate these Clauses if either (i) the Registrar makes a designation
under section 4 of the Regulations in relation to each jurisdiction in which the Data Importer
is incorporated or operates or uses the Personal Data; or (ii) each such jurisdiction not so
designated is added to the list in Schedule 3 to the Regulations.

(4)

The Parties agree that the termination of these Clauses at any time, in any circumstances
and for whatever reason (except for termination under sub‐clause (3)) does not exempt
them from the obligations and/or conditions under the Clauses as regards the Processing of
the Personal Data transferred.

9.

Variation of these Clauses

The Parties may not modify these Clauses except to update any information in Annex B. This does
not preclude the Parties from adding additional commercial clauses where required as long as they
do not contradict the Clauses.
10.

Description of the Transfer

The details of the transfer and of the Personal Data are specified in Annex B. The Parties agree that
Annex B may contain confidential business information which they will not disclose to Third Parties,
except as required by the Regulations or in response to a competent regulatory or government
agency. The Parties may execute additional annexes to cover additional transfers, which will be
submitted to the Registrar where required. Annex B may, in the alternative, be drafted to cover
multiple transfers.

Liability and termination

(1)

The Parties agree that any Data Subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach
of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any Party or Subprocessor is
entitled to receive compensation from the Data Exporter for the damage suffered.

(2)
(a)

If a Data Subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with
sub‐clause (1) against the Data Exporter, arising out of a breach by the Data
Importer or his Subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in
Clause 11, because the Data Exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in
law or has become insolvent, the Data Importer agrees that the Data Subject may
issue a claim against the Data Importer as if it were the Data Exporter, unless any
successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the Data Exporter by
contract or by operation of law, in which case the Data Subject can enforce its rights
against such entity.

(b)

(3)

The Data Importer may not rely on a breach by a Subprocessor of its obligations in
order to avoid its own liabilities.

If a Data Subject is not able to bring a claim against the Data Exporter or the Data Importer
referred to in sub‐clauses (1) and (2), arising out of a breach by the Subprocessor of any of
their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the Data Exporter and
the Data Importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become
insolvent, the Subprocessor agrees that the Data Subject may issue a claim against the data
Subprocessor with regard to its own Processing operations under the Clauses as if it were
the Data Exporter or the Data Importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire
legal obligations of the Data Exporter or Data Importer by contract or by operation of law, in
which case the Data Subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the
Subprocessor shall be limited to its own Processing operations under the Clauses.

24

(4)

In addition to the Data Exporter's entitlement to terminate the Clauses in accordance with
Clause 5(a), either Party may terminate these Clauses if: (i) the Registrar makes a
designation under section 4 of the Regulations which remains in force, in relation to each
jurisdiction in which the Data Importer and each of its Subprocessors is incorporated or
operates or uses the Personal Data; or (ii) each such jurisdiction not so designated is added
to the list in Schedule 3 to the Regulations.

(5)

The Parties agree that the termination of these Clauses at any time, in any circumstances
and for whatever reason (except for termination under sub‐clause (4)) does not exempt
them from the obligations and/or conditions under the Clauses as regards the Processing of
the Personal Data transferred.

7.

Mediation and jurisdiction

(1)

The Data Importer agrees that if the Data Subject invokes against it Third Party beneficiary
rights and/or claims of compensation for damages under the Clauses, the Data Importer will
accept the decision of the Data Subject–
(a)

to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable,
by the Registrar; and

(b)

to refer the dispute to the Court.

(2)

The Parties agree that the choice made by the Data Subject will not prejudice its substantive
or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or
international law.

8.

Cooperation with the Registrar

(1)

The Data Exporter shall be entitled to deposit a copy of these Clauses with the Registrar if
the Registrar so requests or if such deposit is required under the Regulations.

(2)

The Parties agree that the Registrar has the right to exercise its functions and powers
outlined in section 14 of the Regulations in respect of the Data Importer and any
Subprocessor, in the same scope and subject to the same conditions as would apply to a
Data Processor of the Data Exporter under the Regulations.

9.

Governing Law

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.
10.

Variation of the clauses

The Parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses except to update any information in Annex
A. This does not preclude the Parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required,
as long as they do not contradict the Clauses.
11.

Subprocessing

(1)

The Data Importer shall not subcontract any of its Processing operations performed on
behalf of the Data Exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the Data
Exporter. Where the Data Importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses with the
consent of the Data Exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the

25

Subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the Subprocessor as are imposed on
the Data Importer under the Clauses. This may be satisfied by the Subprocessor executing
and becoming bound contractually by the Clauses as entered into between the Data
Exporter and the Data Importer. Where the Subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection
obligations under such written agreement, the Data Importer shall remain fully liable to the
Data Exporter for the performance of the Subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.
(2)

The prior written contract between the Data Importer and the Subprocessor shall also
provide for a Third Party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the Data
Subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in Clause 6(1) against the
Data Exporter or the Data Importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased
to exist in law or have become insolvent, and no successor entity has assumed the entire
legal obligations of the Data Exporter or Data Importer by contract or by operation of law.
Such third party liability of the Subprocessor shall be limited to its own Processing
operations under the Clauses.

(3)

The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred
to in sub‐clause (1) shall be governed by the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.

(4)

The Data Exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the
Clauses and notified by the Data Importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at
least once a year. The list shall be made available to the Registrar.

12.

Obligation after the termination of Personal Data Processing services

(1)

The Parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data Processing services, the
Data Importer and the Subprocessor shall, at the choice of the Data Exporter, return all the
Personal Data transferred and the copies thereof to the Data Exporter or shall destroy all the
Personal Data and certify to the Data Exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed
upon the Data Importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the Personal
Data transferred. In that case, the Data Importer warrants that it will guarantee the
confidentiality of the Personal Data transferred and will not actively process the Personal
Data transferred any further.

(2)

The Data Importer and the Subprocessor warrant that upon request of the Data Exporter
and/or of the Registrar, it will submit its data Processing facilities for an audit of the
measures referred to in sub‐clause (1).
