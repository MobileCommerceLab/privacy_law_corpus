1. PURPOSE
These general guidelines have been adopted to provide a clear
and uniform interpretation of the applicability of the General
Data Protection Regulation (“the Regulation”) and the Data
Protection Act, CAP. 586 of the Laws of Malta (“the Act”) in
the political environment where political parties and candidates
process personal data for the purposes of carrying out political
campaigning and promoting their political ideologies and
messages.

2. DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of these guidelines, unless otherwise specified,
the definitions contained in the Regulation shall apply.
Data controller shall mean any political party as defined under
Article 2 of the General Elections Act, CAP. 354 of the Laws of
Malta, Member of Parliament, movement or candidate who runs
for election, be it a general election, local councils election or a
European Parliament election, either on a political party’s ticket
or independently;
Consent shall be explicit and the manner how a data subject
shall signify agreement to the processing of personal data must
involve a statement or a clear affirmative action;
Direct marketing shall include the promotion of the political
aims and ideals of the data controller. The sending of a
communication by a data controller where the nature of such
communication is not political but is intended to politically
influence the data subject by means of a personal message,
such as the sending of greeting cards, shall also fall within the
meaning of these general guidelines;

3. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING
It is recognised that, to ensure a healthy democratic process,
political parties and candidates, need to engage the interest of
eligible voters by transmitting their political messages by means
of a variety of communication methods.
In this context, the data controller may process personal data,
for the purpose of carrying out this marketing processing
activity, only after obtaining the data subject’s consent. It is the

responsibility of the data controller to demonstrate, at any time
when requested, that the data subject has indeed consented to
the processing of his or her personal data.
In terms of Article 9.2(d) the Regulation, political parties may,
in the course of their legitimate activities and with appropriate
guarantees, process special categories of personal data
concerning their registered members and of other persons who
have regular contact with the party.
The data controller shall take all necessary measures to identify
itself in any political message sent for political campaigning
purposes and shall observe the requirements for processing
as listed under Article 5 of the Regulation, particularly, the
purpose limitation principle, which establishes that personal
data, legitimately collected by the data controller, shall be
solely processed for the purpose for which such data has been
originally collected.

4. DOOR-TO-DOOR POLITICAL COMMUNICATION
The provisions of the Regulation and the Act shall not apply
where no personal data is processed by the data controller for
the purpose of carrying out a political campaign, for instance,
where the communication material is manually distributed and
dropped in letter boxes. Persons engaged to distribute such
material should, nevertheless, respect those households who
would have indicated their objection on the letter boxes to
receiving political or any other types of marketing material.

5. PERSONALISED POLITICAL COMMUNICATIONS
TRANSMITTED BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS –
POSTAL SERVICES AND TELEPHONE/MOBILE
The data controller may use the personal data contained in the
electoral register or in the printed or online telephone directory
services to communicate personalised political campaigning
material or voice messages to the respective registered voters
or listed subscribers, unless the data subject gives notice to
object such processing.
The data controller shall provide data subjects with clear
information to appropriately inform them of their right to
object, at no cost, from receiving further communication.
The opt-out option must be included on each communication

and provide the data subject with a clear and simple option
to exercise such right. In the case of telephone calls, the data
controller must respect the decision of those individuals who
expressly indicate the wish not to proceed with the call and
delete their personal contact details accordingly.

6. POLITICAL COMMUNICATION SENT BY EMAIL,
SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE (SMS) OR BY MEANS OF
AN AUTOMATED CALLING MACHINE
The data controller must ensure that political communications
sent by electronic means are only addressed to data subjects
who have given their prior consent or who have themselves
provided their email addresses or mobile numbers during the
membership enrolling process or during a political or related
activity.
Where the contact details are not obtained directly from the
individual but from other sources, such as activists or other
third parties who are in contact with the data subject, the data
controller must ensure that such consent had been obtained
and documented.
The data controller shall provide the data subject with the
opportunity to opt-out from receiving further communications.
An information clause must be included on each outgoing
message informing the recipient of his right to oppose, at no
charge and in a simple manner. Whereas in the case of emails
the use of an unsubscribe link is the best-practice technical
solution, in the case of SMSs, the data controller shall adopt
best-practice measures to ensure that the necessary contact
information is provided to the data subject giving him or her an
easy way to unsubscribe, such as including a contact number
or email address on each and every message.
Where the data controller engages the services of a third
party contractor to send bulk political communications on its
behalf and specifically to mobile numbers which are held on
the database of the same contractor, the data controller shall
remain responsible for the messages that are transmitted. In
these circumstances, the data controller must ensure that the
contractor has indeed obtained the consent of those recipients
to whom the marketing messages are directed by retaining the
necessary documentation indicating their prior consent.

7. THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR POLITICAL
CAMPAIGNING PURPOSES
The use of social media has become a widely adopted tool
which may be used by a data controller to carry out a political
campaign. This means that the data controller’s activities,
carried out through the registered profile or account, shall
be subject to the legal criteria and principles set out in the
Regulation, where the principal legitimate basis for the
processing of personal data shall be the data subject’s consent.
It shall be clarified that where a user of a social networking
site, hence a data subject, associates himself with the profile
or account of the data controller by, for instance, liking or
following a page, that action shall be tantamount to consent.
Consequently, any personal information available on the user’s
profile, such as a mobile number or an email address, may be
used by the data controller for political campaigning purposes.
In any case, users should be provided with effective means, to
exercise their right to object to the processing of their personal
data for the purposes of the campaign, free of charge and
without having to state the reason thereof.

8. CONTACTING VOTERS ON ELECTION DAY
ENCOURAGING THEM TO CAST THEIR VOTE
The data controller may, on election day, adopt a system
designed to implement a structured and dedicated process to
contact eligible voters and encourage them to cast their vote,
provided that the contact details have been supplied by the
data subject himself, obtained from a telephone directory or
made available on an open social media profile or account. A
data subject shall, nevertheless, have the right to oppose from
proceeding with the call or to be re-contacted.

9. FINES
To guarantee fair and lawful processing, the data controller
shall assume the legal responsibility to comply with these
guidelines. If the Commissioner concludes that personal data
was processed or may be processed in an unlawful manner, he
may impose an administrative fine in terms of his powers
at law.
