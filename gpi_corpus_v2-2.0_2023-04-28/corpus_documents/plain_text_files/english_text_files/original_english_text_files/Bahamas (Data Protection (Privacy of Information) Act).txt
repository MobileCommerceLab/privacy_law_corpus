that

it

would

be

reasonable

for

the

data

controller

to

conclude that, if any particulars identifying that other
individual were omitted, the data could then be disclosed as
aforesaid without his being thereby identified to the data
subject, the data controller shall be obliged to disclose the
data

to

the

data

subject

with

the

omission

of

those

particulars.
(6)

Information supplied pursuant to a request

under subsection (1) may take account of any amendment of the
personal data concerned made since the receipt of the request

has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and
the making of the current request.
