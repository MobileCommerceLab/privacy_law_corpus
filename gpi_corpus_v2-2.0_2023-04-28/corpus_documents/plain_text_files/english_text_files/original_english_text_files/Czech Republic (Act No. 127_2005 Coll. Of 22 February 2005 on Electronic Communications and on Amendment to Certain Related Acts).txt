Section 48
Calculation of the Net Costs of Universal
Service Provision

(1) The Office shall calculate the net
costs of the provision of the universal service
by the procedure specified in Subsections 2 to
7. If the universal service provider was
selected on the basis of a tender, the Office
shall make its calculation on the basis of the
universal service provision net cost calculation
as proposed by the Provider in the tender
according to Section 39 Subsection 5.

(2) Net costs mean the costs calculated
as the difference between the costs efficiently
and purposefully incurred by the undertaking
obliged to provide the universal service and the
costs efficiently and purposefully incurred by
an undertaking without such an obligation,
taking into account a reasonable return on the
capital invested and the costs the incurrence of
which the undertaking would have avoided if it
were not for its obligation to provide universal
service, and also taking into account the
market benefits gained by the undertaking
from universal service provision. The net costs
shall be calculated for the calendar year in
which the universal service provider was
obliged to provide universal service
(hereinafter referred to as the “billing period”).
(3) The net costs may only include the
costs of fulfilling the obligations referred to in
Section 38 Subsections 2 and 3 above. The net
costs of fulfilment the individual obligations
imposed within the universal service must be
calculated separately for each of the
obligations; double billing of any direct or
indirect costs and market benefits is forbidden.

(4) The total net costs of universal
service provision by all the undertakings
concerned shall be calculated as a sum of the
net costs of fulfilment the individual
obligations imposed under the universal
service arrangement.
(5) The complete supporting documents,
allowing to make a correct calculation of the
net costs for the billing period, shall be
submitted by the universal service provider to
the Office no later than 31 July of the calendar
year following the billing period. The universal
service provider is responsible for the
correctness and completeness of the
calculation submitted by it, as well as for the
submitted documents and supporting evidence.
The Office shall calculate the net costs on the
basis of the net cost calculation performed by
the universal service provider in accordance
with Subsections 2 and 3 above and on the
basis of accounting documents, as well as other
evidence, if any, by which the universal
service provider must support his calculations.
If the Office finds that the service provider’s
supporting evidence is incomplete or contains
misstatements, the Office shall afford the
provider a reasonable period of time to
complete and/or correct the supporting

evidence. In the event that the universal service
provider fails to make the corrections within
the prescribed period of time, the Office shall
not include the costs of the fulfilment of the
obligation imposed within the universal
service, to which the incomplete or insufficient
documentation applies, in its calculation of the
net costs of universal service provision.

(6) The Office shall audit the supporting
documentation
for
correctness
and
completeness within 6 weeks of the submission
or completion thereof according to Section 5
above, or may authorise a third party, whose
impartiality and independence of the universal
service provider is guaranteed, to do the audit.
The Office shall publish the conclusions of the
audit as well as the result and method of
calculation of the universal service provision
net costs. The Office shall correct and
immediately publish any typing and
calculation errors and other obvious mistakes.
(7) An implementing legal regulation
shall be issued to determine the procedure to
be used by the Office in determining the net
costs of universal service provision, including
also the criteria of evaluation of unbearable
economic burden, the method to calculate the
net costs of partial service provision, the
method of defining the market benefits as
referred to in Subsection 2 above and the
documentation to support the calculations.
Section 49
Universal Service Financing

(1) The universal service provider shall
submit to the Office its application for
compensation of net costs no later than 31 July
of the calendar year following after the billing
period.
(2) The Office shall determine whether
the net costs of universal service provision,
specified on the basis of Section 48, represents
unbearable burden for the provider.
(3) To cover the net costs, the Office
shall open a universal service account
(hereinafter referred to as the “Account”),
which it administers. The Account is outside
the State Budget. The sources in the Account
shall be maintained with a bank and may only
be used for purposes based hereon. The
balance in the account at the end of the

calendar year shall be rolled over to the next
year. Interest on the universal service account
represents income to the State Budget and the
payments for bank services relating to the
maintenance of the Account represent an
expenditure of the State Budget.

(4) The receipts in the Account shall
include the payments made by payers,
penalties as referred in Subsection 11, and may
also include financial support from the State,
which is repayable in 2 years. The Office shall
maintain payer records. The expenses from the
Account are payments to the universal service
providers and instalments on the financial
support from the State. The expenses are
defrayed by the payers.

(5) A payer may be any undertaking,
including the provider of the universal service
concerned, which provides interconnection and
access to the publicly accessible electronic
communications network, publicly available
telephone service, leased lines service, Internet
access service or any other publicly available
data service in the territory of the Czech
Republic in the billing period regardless of
whether such an undertaking is, or is not, based
in the Czech Republic. The amount of the
payment made by the payer shall not exceed
one percent of its revenues within one billing
period.

(6) An undertaking whose aggregate
revenues from the provision of the publicly
available telephone service, Internet access
service or any other data service for the billing
period are below CZK 10,000,000.- is not
treated as a payer.

(7) The Office shall determine by a
measure of general nature the percent
proportions of the service provision revenues
referred to in Subsection 5 for the individual
payers out of the total service provision
revenues referred to in Subsection 5 for all
payers within the given billing period.
(8) On

the basis of the percent
proportion defined according to Subsection 7
above, the Office shall immediately determine
the amount of the payer’s payment from the
net costs calculated according to Section 48
above and from the instalment of returnable
financial assistance from the State, if any. The
Office shall issue a payment assessment in

respect of the level of payment determined21.
The obligation to make the payment shall arise
for the payer as at the date specified in the
payment assessment.

(9) In the event that the amount of the
payment exceeds one percent of the payer’s
revenues, the Office shall pay the difference.
(10) After reception of the payments to
the account, the Office shall without delay
transfer the source to the universal service
provider for the defrayment of the net costs
defined by the procedure carried out in
accordance with Section 48 upon subtraction
of the payment thereof made in accordance
with Subsection 8.

(11) If financial resources were drawn
from the Account on the basis of incorrect or
incomplete data from the universal service
provider, such a provider shall return the
financial resources drawn in an unauthorised
way no later than within 15 days from the date
of the notice made by the Office. The universal
service provider shall at the same time pay a
penalty of 1 per mile, on a daily basis, of the
amount drawn in an unauthorised way, which,
however, shall not be higher than the amount
itself. The penalty is a receipt to the Account.
To reduce the strictness of the regulation, the
Office may reduce or waive the penalty.

(12) If a lower percent proportion was
determined for a payer on the basis of incorrect
or incomplete data and information provided
by that payer, the Office shall issue a new
payment assessment on the basis of a corrected
calculation of the percent proportion to impose
on that payer the obligation to pay the
difference between the initially determined
amount of the payment and the new payment
liability. The amount so paid shall be used to
defray the net costs calculated for the nearest
following billing period.

(13) In the collection and requisition the
payments, the Office shall proceed mutatis
mutandis in accordance with a special legal
regulation22. For these purposes, the sources in
the universal service account shall be treated as
sources of a state fund.

(14) The Office shall cancel the Account
in the event that no net cost defrayment has
been made from it for three years and that it
has not been determined that universal service
provision represents an unbearable burden to
the provider. If the account is cancelled, the
Office shall transfer balance in the Account to
the Radiocommunications Account.

b)

Application of Price Regulation

(1) If it is proved by the analysis of the
relevant
market
associated
with
interconnection or access, performed in
accordance with Section 51, that this market is
not efficiently competitive, the reasons being,
without limitation, that unreasonably high or
unreasonably low prices are applied to the

application of measures taken by the Office on
the basis Subsection 1 did not remedy the
situation, the Office is entitled to apply price
regulation in the relevant market by issuing a
pricing decision.
(3) If price regulation based on
Subsections 1 and 2 above is imposed on an
undertaking with significant market power, the
decision made by the Office shall take into
account the capital expenditures incurred by
that undertaking and the related risks, and shall
allow that undertaking to get its investment
back within a reasonable period of time.
(4) If the price applied in accordance
with Section 55 Subsection 3 discourages
subscribers from using services according to
Section 34 or Section 70, the Office may issue

telephone number portability for subscribers,
the Office may determine no specific or
common prices.

universal service provider that submits a bill
containing an itemised list of the individual
calls shall also provide for a consideration a
suitable alternative to the price billing, if so
requested by the subscriber, in order to provide
increased protection of the subscriber’s
privacy, such an alternative being, for

price without undue delay no later than 2
months after the date of delivery of the bill
containing the price for the service provided,
otherwise the entitlement to raise a claim shall
lapse. If no bill is delivered because of the type
of service provided, the subscriber or user is
entitled to raise a claim within 2 months of the

so by preventing the subscriber from active
access to the service, except for making calls
to the emergency call numbers. The price for
the demonstrable notification shall be costoriented.
(3) The undertaking referred to in
Subsection 1 above may terminate the
contractual relation with the subscriber or
refuse to provide access to the electronic
communications service for the subscriber if
the latter purposefully indicated false personal

services indicated in the bill, or has been
continuously leaving the bills unpaid; in so
doing, the undertaking must be able to prove
having notified the subscriber to that effect.
For the purposes hereof, being continuously in
arrears with payments shall be understood to
mean payment of at least two successive bills
after the due date. For the purposes hereof,
continuously leaving the bills unpaid shall be
understood to mean that at least three
successive bills have been left unpaid.

means any technical equipment or measure
designed to ensure that access to protected
radio or television broadcasting is provided in
a legible form. Such access is conditional on
subscription or on any other form of prior
individual authorisation.
(4) Only such gateway may be used, as
technically ensures effective transfer of the
management functions irrespective of the
broadcasting transmission facilities, which
functions make it possible for the undertakings
providing the transmission of digital
broadcasting signals at the local or regional
level to manage completely the services that
use the gateway.
(5) Independently of the broadcasting
transmission facilities, the undertakings
providing the service of dissemination of
protected content, on whose services the digital
radio and television broadcasters depend in
terms of covering all the groups of potential
audience, shall offer to those broadcasters on a
fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis
the services that make it possible for the
viewers or listeners authorised to receive the
digitally transmitted services of those
broadcasters through a gateway, which is
administered by digital audio and television
broadcasters.
(6) If the Office finds, having performed
an analysis of the relevant market, that no
entity does have significant market power in
the area of the digital broadcasting service to
end users, it may – irrespective of the

provisions of Subsections 4 and 5 above –
change or cancel the obligations of the
undertakings providing the dissemination
services, but may only do so to the extent to
which such a change or cancellation:
a)

b)

does not adversely affect end users’
access to digital broadcasting and to the
programme channels and services
specified in compliance with Section 72,
does not endanger for the future the
effective competition on the markets of
the digital television and radio
broadcasting to end users or on the
markets of conditional access systems and
other associated facilities.

The Office must ensure that the entities to be
affected by the change or cancellation of the
above obligations are notified to that effect
well in advance.

any information as may be needed for the
provision of all the API-supported services to a
full functional form. These owners are entitled
to reimbursement for the costs efficiently and
demonstrably incurred in the provision of
information.
(8) The conditions applied by the Office
in accordance with Section 83 have no bearing
whatsoever on the obligations determined by
the Broadcasting Council in terms of the
method of presentation of the electronic
programme guide (EPG) and similar review
and guiding facilities within the framework of
content regulation. If the Office so requests,

obligations
in
order
that
fairness,
proportionality and timeliness are secured.
(3) For reasons of environmental
protection, public health, security of the State,
or to ensure that territory-planning objectives
are achieved, the Office is entitled to take a
decision also to impose the obligations referred
to in Subsection 2 Clause e) on an undertaking
providing a public communications network,

levels;
initial capital expenditures of the owner of
the equipment, including the risks
associated with that investment;
the need for long-term protection of the
competitive environment;
the intellectual property rights;
provision of pan-European services.

(5) An undertaking with significant
market power in the relevant market on which
the Office imposed an obligation specified in
Subsections 2 or 3 may refuse a draft contract
for access or draft contract for interconnection
during negotiations about such a draft, if the
proposed access or interconnection does not
meet the technical parameters or if it would
affect the integrity of the network.
(6) In the event that an undertaking
refused a draft contract for access or
interconnection in accordance with Subsection
5, such an undertaking shall – no later than 15
days of delivery of such a draft – request the
consent of the Office with the refusal of the
contract and shall indicate the reasons for the

Proceedings to Repeal a Measure of
General Nature or a Part Thereof
Section 101a
(1) A motion to repeal a measure of
general nature or any part thereof may be
submitted by anyone who asserts having
been restricted in his rights by the measure

of general nature, issued by the
administrative body. If the petitioner is at
the same time entitled in accordance with
to file a complaint or any other motion to
an administrative court in the matter in
which the measure of general nature was
used, he may only propose repeal of the
measure of general nature in conjunction
with such a motion.
(2) A motion for repeal of a measure
of general nature or any part thereof,
issued by a local or regional municipality,
may also be filed by the Ministry of
Interior.
(3) A motion for repeal of a measure
of general nature or any part thereof,
issued by a regional municipality, may also
be filed by a local municipality.

issued the measure of general nature the
repeal of which, or any part thereof, is
required.

Participation of other persons in the
proceedings (Section 34) is excluded.
Section 101c
The appropriate venue for the
proceedings to repeal a measure of general
nature is the Supreme Administrative
Court.
Section 101d
The Judgment and the Effect
Thereof
(1) In making its decision, the Court
considers the compliance of the measure of
general nature with law and also considers
whether the person who issued it
proceeded within the range of his powers
and competence and whether the measure
of general nature was issued in the manner
prescribed by law. The legal reasons for
the motion are not binding on the Court.
(2) If the Court arrives at the
conclusion that the measure of general
nature or its parts are in contradiction with
law, or that the person who issued it

surpassed the limits of his powers and
competence, or that the measure of general
nature was not issued in the manner
prescribed by law, it repeals the measure
of general nature or a part thereof as at the
date which it specifies in the judgement. If
the motion is ill-grounded, the Court
rejects it. The Court shall make its decision
on the motion to repeal the measure of
general nature or its part within thirty days
after the date on which the motion reached
the Court.
(3) If a decision on an administrative
offence was made on the basis of a
measure of general nature that was
repealed or on the basis of a part of a
measure of general nature that was
repealed, and the decision has become
final but has not yet been executed, the
repeal of such a measure of general nature
or a part thereof provides grounds for
resumption of the proceedings in
accordance with the provisions of the
applicable procedural rules.
(4) The rights and duties resulting
from the legal relations that arose before
the repeal of the measure of general nature
shall remain unaffected.
(5) None of the participants of the
proceedings is entitled to reimbursement for
the costs of the proceedings.“.
