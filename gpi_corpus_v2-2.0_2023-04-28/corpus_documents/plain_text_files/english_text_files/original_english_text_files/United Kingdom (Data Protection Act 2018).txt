If, on an appeal under subsection (3), the Tribunal finds that, applying the
principles applied by a court on an application for judicial review, the Minister
did not have reasonable grounds for issuing a certificate, the Tribunal may—
(a) allow the appeal, and
(b) quash the certificate.

(5)

Where, in any proceedings under or by virtue of the applied GDPR or this Act,
it is claimed by a controller that a certificate under subsection (1) which
identifies the personal data to which it applies by means of a general
description applies to any personal data, another party to the proceedings may
appeal to the Tribunal on the ground that the certificate does not apply to the
personal data in question.

(6)

But, subject to any determination under subsection (7), the certificate is to be
conclusively presumed so to apply.

(7)

On an appeal under subsection (5), the Tribunal may determine that the
certificate does not so apply.

(8)

A document purporting to be a certificate under subsection (1) is to be—
(a) received in evidence, and
(b) deemed to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.

(9)

A document which purports to be certified by or on behalf of a Minister of the
Crown as a true copy of a certificate issued by that Minister under subsection
(1) is—
(a) in any legal proceedings, evidence of that certificate;
(b) in any legal proceedings in Scotland, sufficient evidence of that
certificate.

(10)

The power conferred by subsection (1) on a Minister of the Crown is
exercisable only by—
(a) a Minister who is a member of the Cabinet, or
(b) the Attorney General or the Advocate General for Scotland.

28

National security and defence: modifications to Articles 9 and 32 of the
applied GDPR
(1)

Article 9(1) of the applied GDPR (prohibition on processing of special
categories of personal data) does not prohibit the processing of personal data
to which this Chapter applies to the extent that the processing is carried out—
(a) for the purpose of safeguarding national security or for defence
purposes, and
(b) with appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data
subjects.

(2)

Article 32 of the applied GDPR (security of processing) does not apply to a
controller or processor to the extent that the controller or the processor (as the
case may be) is processing personal data to which this Chapter applies for—
(a) the purpose of safeguarding national security, or
(b) defence purposes.

(3)

Where Article 32 of the applied GDPR does not apply, the controller or the
processor must implement security measures appropriate to the risks arising
from the processing of the personal data.

(4)

For the purposes of subsection (3), where the processing of personal data is
carried out wholly or partly by automated means, the controller or the
processor must, following an evaluation of the risks, implement measures
designed to—
(a) prevent unauthorised processing or unauthorised interference with the
systems used in connection with the processing,
(b) ensure that it is possible to establish the precise details of any
processing that takes place,
(c) ensure that any systems used in connection with the processing
function properly and may, in the case of interruption, be restored, and
(d) ensure that stored personal data cannot be corrupted if a system used
in connection with the processing malfunctions.

(1)

This Chapter sets out the six data protection principles as follows—
(a) section 35(1) sets out the first data protection principle (requirement
that processing be lawful and fair);
(b) section 36(1) sets out the second data protection principle (requirement
that purposes of processing be specified, explicit and legitimate);
(c) section 37 sets out the third data protection principle (requirement that
personal data be adequate, relevant and not excessive);
(d) section 38(1) sets out the fourth data protection principle (requirement
that personal data be accurate and kept up to date);
(e) section 39(1) sets out the fifth data protection principle (requirement
that personal data be kept for no longer than is necessary);

22

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 2 — Principles

(3)

35

The controller in relation to personal data is responsible for, and must be able
to demonstrate, compliance with this Chapter.
The first data protection principle

(1)

The first data protection principle is that the processing of personal data for
any of the law enforcement purposes must be lawful and fair.

(2)

The processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes is
lawful only if and to the extent that it is based on law and either—
(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing for that purpose, or
(b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for
that purpose by a competent authority.

(3)

In addition, where the processing for any of the law enforcement purposes is
sensitive processing, the processing is permitted only in the two cases set out
in subsections (4) and (5).

(4)

The first case is where—
(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing for the law
enforcement purpose as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and
(b) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an
appropriate policy document in place (see section 42).

(5)

The second case is where—
(a) the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose,
(b) the processing meets at least one of the conditions in Schedule 8, and
(c) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an
appropriate policy document in place (see section 42).

(6)

The Secretary of State may by regulations amend Schedule 8—
(a) by adding conditions;
(b) by omitting conditions added by regulations under paragraph (a).

(7)

Regulations under subsection (6) are subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure.

(8)

In this section, “sensitive processing” means—
(a) the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union
membership;
(b) the processing of genetic data, or of biometric data, for the purpose of
uniquely identifying an individual;
(c) the processing of data concerning health;
(d) the processing of data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual
orientation.

36

The second data protection principle
(1)

The second data protection principle is that—
(a) the law enforcement purpose for which personal data is collected on
any occasion must be specified, explicit and legitimate, and
(b) personal data so collected must not be processed in a manner that is
incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected.

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 2 — Principles

23

(2)

Paragraph (b) of the second data protection principle is subject to subsections
(3) and (4).

(3)

Personal data collected for a law enforcement purpose may be processed for
any other law enforcement purpose (whether by the controller that collected
the data or by another controller) provided that—
(a) the controller is authorised by law to process the data for the other
purpose, and
(b) the processing is necessary and proportionate to that other purpose.

(4)

Personal data collected for any of the law enforcement purposes may not be
processed for a purpose that is not a law enforcement purpose unless the
processing is authorised by law.

37

The third data protection principle
The third data protection principle is that personal data processed for any of
the law enforcement purposes must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in
relation to the purpose for which it is processed.

38

The fourth data protection principle
(1)

The fourth data protection principle is that—
(a) personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must
be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, and
(b) every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is
inaccurate, having regard to the law enforcement purpose for which it
is processed, is erased or rectified without delay.

(2)

In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, personal
data based on facts must, so far as possible, be distinguished from personal
data based on personal assessments.

(3)

In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, a clear
distinction must, where relevant and as far as possible, be made between
personal data relating to different categories of data subject, such as—
(a) persons suspected of having committed or being about to commit a
criminal offence;
(b) persons convicted of a criminal offence;
(c) persons who are or may be victims of a criminal offence;
(d) witnesses or other persons with information about offences.

(4)

All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data which is
inaccurate, incomplete or no longer up to date is not transmitted or made
available for any of the law enforcement purposes.

(5)

For that purpose—
(a) the quality of personal data must be verified before it is transmitted or
made available,
(b) in all transmissions of personal data, the necessary information
enabling the recipient to assess the degree of accuracy, completeness
and reliability of the data and the extent to which it is up to date must
be included, and

24

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 2 — Principles

(c)

39

if, after personal data has been transmitted, it emerges that the data was
incorrect or that the transmission was unlawful, the recipient must be
notified without delay.

The fifth data protection principle
(1)

The fifth data protection principle is that personal data processed for any of the
law enforcement purposes must be kept for no longer than is necessary for the
purpose for which it is processed.

(2)

Appropriate time limits must be established for the periodic review of the need
for the continued storage of personal data for any of the law enforcement
purposes.

40

The sixth data protection principle
The sixth data protection principle is that personal data processed for any of
the law enforcement purposes must be so processed in a manner that ensures
appropriate security of the personal data, using appropriate technical or
organisational measures (and, in this principle, “appropriate security” includes
protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental
loss, destruction or damage).

41

Safeguards: archiving
(1)

This section applies in relation to the processing of personal data for a law
enforcement purpose where the processing is necessary—
(a) for archiving purposes in the public interest,
(b) for scientific or historical research purposes, or
(c) for statistical purposes.

(2)

The processing is not permitted if—
(a) it is carried out for the purposes of, or in connection with, measures or
decisions with respect to a particular data subject, or
(b) it is likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress to a data
subject.

42

Safeguards: sensitive processing
(1)

This section applies for the purposes of section 35(4) and (5) (which require a
controller to have an appropriate policy document in place when carrying out
sensitive processing in reliance on the consent of the data subject or, as the case
may be, in reliance on a condition specified in Schedule 8).

(2)

The controller has an appropriate policy document in place in relation to the
sensitive processing if the controller has produced a document which—
(a) explains the controller’s procedures for securing compliance with the
data protection principles (see section 34(1)) in connection with
sensitive processing in reliance on the consent of the data subject or (as
the case may be) in reliance on the condition in question, and
(b) explains the controller’s policies as regards the retention and erasure of
personal data processed in reliance on the consent of the data subject or
(as the case may be) in reliance on the condition in question, giving an
indication of how long such personal data is likely to be retained.

25

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 2 — Principles

(3)

Where personal data is processed on the basis that an appropriate policy
document is in place, the controller must during the relevant period—
(a) retain the appropriate policy document,
(b) review and (if appropriate) update it from time to time, and
(c) make it available to the Commissioner, on request, without charge.

(4)

The record maintained by the controller under section 61(1) and, where the
sensitive processing is carried out by a processor on behalf of the controller, the
record maintained by the processor under section 61(3) must include the
following information—
(a) whether the sensitive processing is carried out in reliance on the
consent of the data subject or, if not, which condition in Schedule 8 is
relied on,
(b) how the processing satisfies section 35 (lawfulness of processing), and
(c) whether the personal data is retained and erased in accordance with the
policies described in subsection (2)(b) and, if it is not, the reasons for not
following those policies.

(5)

In this section, “relevant period”, in relation to sensitive processing in reliance
on the consent of the data subject or in reliance on a condition specified in
Schedule 8, means a period which—
(a) begins when the controller starts to carry out the sensitive processing in
reliance on the data subject’s consent or (as the case may be) in reliance
on that condition, and
(b) ends at the end of the period of 6 months beginning when the controller
ceases to carry out the processing.

General principles for transfers
73

General principles for transfers of personal data
(1)

A controller may not transfer personal data to a third country or to an
international organisation unless—
(a) the three conditions set out in subsections (2) to (4) are met, and
(b) in a case where the personal data was originally transmitted or
otherwise made available to the controller or another competent
authority by a member State other than the United Kingdom, that
member State, or any person based in that member State which is a
competent authority for the purposes of the Law Enforcement
Directive, has authorised the transfer in accordance with the law of the
member State.

(2)

Condition 1 is that the transfer is necessary for any of the law enforcement
purposes.

(3)

Condition 2 is that the transfer—
(a) is based on an adequacy decision (see section 74),
(b) if not based on an adequacy decision, is based on there being
appropriate safeguards (see section 75), or
(c) if not based on an adequacy decision or on there being appropriate
safeguards, is based on special circumstances (see section 76).

(4)

Condition 3 is that—
(a) the intended recipient is a relevant authority in a third country or an
international organisation that is a relevant international organisation,
or
(b) in a case where the controller is a competent authority specified in any
of paragraphs 5 to 17, 21, 24 to 28, 34 to 51, 54 and 56 of Schedule 7—
(i) the intended recipient is a person in a third country other than
a relevant authority, and
(ii) the additional conditions in section 77 are met.

(5)

Authorisation is not required as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) if—
(a) the transfer is necessary for the prevention of an immediate and serious
threat either to the public security of a member State or a third country
or to the essential interests of a member State, and
(b) the authorisation cannot be obtained in good time.

(6)

Where a transfer is made without the authorisation mentioned in subsection
(1)(b), the authority in the member State which would have been responsible
for deciding whether to authorise the transfer must be informed without delay.

(7)

In this section, “relevant international organisation” means an international
organisation that carries out functions for any of the law enforcement
purposes.

44

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 5 — Transfers of personal data to third countries etc

74

Transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision
A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation
is based on an adequacy decision where—
(a) the European Commission has decided, in accordance with Article 36
of the Law Enforcement Directive, that—
(i) the third country or a territory or one or more specified sectors
within that third country, or
(ii) (as the case may be) the international organisation,
ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data, and
(b) that decision has not been repealed or suspended, or amended in a way
that demonstrates that the Commission no longer considers there to be
an adequate level of protection of personal data.

75

Transfers on the basis of appropriate safeguards
(1)

A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation
is based on there being appropriate safeguards where—
(a) a legal instrument containing appropriate safeguards for the protection
of personal data binds the intended recipient of the data, or
(b) the controller, having assessed all the circumstances surrounding
transfers of that type of personal data to the third country or
international organisation, concludes that appropriate safeguards exist
to protect the data.

(2)

The controller must inform the Commissioner about the categories of data
transfers that take place in reliance on subsection (1)(b).

(3)

Where a transfer of data takes place in reliance on subsection (1)—
(a) the transfer must be documented,
(b) the documentation must be provided to the Commissioner on request,
and
(c) the documentation must include, in particular—
(i) the date and time of the transfer,
(ii) the name of and any other pertinent information about the
recipient,
(iii) the justification for the transfer, and
(iv) a description of the personal data transferred.

76

Transfers on the basis of special circumstances
(1)

A transfer of personal data to a third country or international organisation is
based on special circumstances where the transfer is necessary—
(a) to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person,
(b) to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data subject,
(c) for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to the public
security of a member State or a third country,
(d) in individual cases for any of the law enforcement purposes, or
(e) in individual cases for a legal purpose.

(2)

But subsection (1)(d) and (e) do not apply if the controller determines that
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject override the public
interest in the transfer.

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 5 — Transfers of personal data to third countries etc

45

(3)

Where a transfer of data takes place in reliance on subsection (1)—
(a) the transfer must be documented,
(b) the documentation must be provided to the Commissioner on request,
and
(c) the documentation must include, in particular—
(i) the date and time of the transfer,
(ii) the name of and any other pertinent information about the
recipient,
(iii) the justification for the transfer, and
(iv) a description of the personal data transferred.

(4)

For the purposes of this section, a transfer is necessary for a legal purpose if—
(a) it is necessary for the purpose of, or in connection with, any legal
proceedings (including prospective legal proceedings) relating to any
of the law enforcement purposes,
(b) it is necessary for the purpose of obtaining legal advice in relation to
any of the law enforcement purposes, or
(c) it is otherwise necessary for the purposes of establishing, exercising or
defending legal rights in relation to any of the law enforcement
purposes.
Transfers to particular recipients

77

Transfers of personal data to persons other than relevant authorities
(1)

The additional conditions referred to in section 73(4)(b)(ii) are the following
four conditions.

(2)

Condition 1 is that the transfer is strictly necessary in a specific case for the
performance of a task of the transferring controller as provided by law for any
of the law enforcement purposes.

(3)

Condition 2 is that the transferring controller has determined that there are no
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject concerned that override
the public interest necessitating the transfer.

(4)

Condition 3 is that the transferring controller considers that the transfer of the
personal data to a relevant authority in the third country would be ineffective
or inappropriate (for example, where the transfer could not be made in
sufficient time to enable its purpose to be fulfilled).

(5)

Condition 4 is that the transferring controller informs the intended recipient of
the specific purpose or purposes for which the personal data may, so far as
necessary, be processed.

(6)

Where personal data is transferred to a person in a third country other than a
relevant authority, the transferring controller must inform a relevant authority
in that third country without undue delay of the transfer, unless this would be
ineffective or inappropriate.

(7)

The transferring controller must—
(a) document any transfer to a recipient in a third country other than a
relevant authority, and
(b) inform the Commissioner about the transfer.

46

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 5 — Transfers of personal data to third countries etc

(8)

This section does not affect the operation of any international agreement in
force between member States and third countries in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police co-operation.
Subsequent transfers

78

Subsequent transfers
(1)

Where personal data is transferred in accordance with section 73, the
transferring controller must make it a condition of the transfer that the data is
not to be further transferred to a third country or international organisation
without the authorisation of the transferring controller or another competent
authority.

(2)

A competent authority may give an authorisation under subsection (1) only
where the further transfer is necessary for a law enforcement purpose.

(3)

In deciding whether to give the authorisation, the competent authority must
take into account (among any other relevant factors)—
(a) the seriousness of the circumstances leading to the request for
authorisation,
(b) the purpose for which the personal data was originally transferred, and
(c) the standards for the protection of personal data that apply in the third
country or international organisation to which the personal data would
be transferred.

(4)

In a case where the personal data was originally transmitted or otherwise made
available to the transferring controller or another competent authority by a
member State other than the United Kingdom, an authorisation may not be
given under subsection (1) unless that member State, or any person based in
that member State which is a competent authority for the purposes of the Law
Enforcement Directive, has authorised the transfer in accordance with the law
of the member State.

(5)

Authorisation is not required as mentioned in subsection (4) if—
(a) the transfer is necessary for the prevention of an immediate and serious
threat either to the public security of a member State or a third country
or to the essential interests of a member State, and
(b) the authorisation cannot be obtained in good time.

(6)

Where a transfer is made without the authorisation mentioned in subsection
(4), the authority in the member State which would have been responsible for
deciding whether to authorise the transfer must be informed without delay.
CHAPTER 6
SUPPLEMENTARY

79

National security: certificate
(1)

A Minister of the Crown may issue a certificate certifying, for the purposes of
section 44(4), 45(4), 48(3) or 68(7), that a restriction is a necessary and
proportionate measure to protect national security.

(2)

The certificate may—

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 3 — Law enforcement processing
Chapter 6 — Supplementary

(a)
(b)

47

relate to a specific restriction (described in the certificate) which a
controller has imposed or is proposing to impose under section 44(4),
45(4), 48(3) or 68(7), or
identify any restriction to which it relates by means of a general
description.

(3)

Subject to subsection (6), a certificate issued under subsection (1) is conclusive
evidence that the specific restriction or (as the case may be) any restriction
falling within the general description is, or at any time was, a necessary and
proportionate measure to protect national security.

(4)

A certificate issued under subsection (1) may be expressed to have prospective
effect.

(5)

Any person directly affected by the issuing of a certificate under subsection (1)
may appeal to the Tribunal against the certificate.

(6)

If, on an appeal under subsection (5), the Tribunal finds that, applying the
principles applied by a court on an application for judicial review, the Minister
did not have reasonable grounds for issuing the certificate, the Tribunal may —
(a) allow the appeal, and
(b) quash the certificate.

(7)

Where in any proceedings under or by virtue of this Act, it is claimed by a
controller that a restriction falls within a general description in a certificate
issued under subsection (1), any other party to the proceedings may appeal to
the Tribunal on the ground that the restriction does not fall within that
description.

(8)

But, subject to any determination under subsection (9), the restriction is to be
conclusively presumed to fall within the general description.

(9)

On an appeal under subsection (7), the Tribunal may determine that the
certificate does not so apply.

(10)

A document purporting to be a certificate under subsection (1) is to be—
(a) received in evidence, and
(b) deemed to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.

(11)

A document which purports to be certified by or on behalf of a Minister of the
Crown as a true copy of a certificate issued by that Minister under subsection
(1) is—
(a) in any legal proceedings, evidence of that certificate, and
(b) in any legal proceedings in Scotland, sufficient evidence of that
certificate.

(12)

The power conferred by subsection (1) on a Minister of the Crown is
exercisable only by—
(a) a Minister who is a member of the Cabinet, or
(b) the Attorney General or the Advocate General for Scotland.

(13)

No power conferred by any provision of Part 6 may be exercised in relation to
the imposition of—
(a) a specific restriction in a certificate under subsection (1), or
(b) a restriction falling within a general description in such a certificate.

(3)

The controller must consider whether, if the personal data had instead been
transmitted or otherwise made available within the United Kingdom to
another competent authority, processing of the data by the other competent
authority would have been subject to any restrictions by virtue of any
enactment or rule of law.

(4)

Where that would be the case, the controller must inform the EU recipient or
non-EU recipient that the data is transmitted or otherwise made available
subject to compliance by that person with the same restrictions (which must be
set out in the information given to that person).

(5)

Except as provided by subsection (4), the controller may not impose
restrictions on the processing of personal data transmitted or otherwise made
available by the controller to an EU recipient.

(6)

Subsection (7) applies where—
(a) a competent authority for the purposes of the Law Enforcement
Directive in a member State other than the United Kingdom transmits
or otherwise makes available personal data to a controller for a law
enforcement purpose, and
(b) the competent authority in the other member State informs the
controller, in accordance with any law of that member State which
implements Article 9(3) and (4) of the Law Enforcement Directive, that
the data is transmitted or otherwise made available subject to
compliance by the controller with restrictions set out by the competent
authority.

(7)

The controller must comply with the restrictions.

81

Reporting of infringements
(1)

Each controller must implement effective mechanisms to encourage the
reporting of an infringement of this Part.

Employment Rights Act 1996 and Part 5A of the Employment Rights
(Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/1919 (N.I. 16)), and
such other protections for a person who reports an infringement of this
Part as the controller considers appropriate.

(4)

A person who reports an infringement of this Part does not breach—
(a) an obligation of confidence owed by the person, or
(b) any other restriction on the disclosure of information (however
imposed).

(5)

Subsection (4) does not apply if or to the extent that the report includes a
disclosure which is prohibited by any of Parts 1 to 7 or Chapter 1 of Part 9 of
the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.

(6)

Until the repeal of Part 1 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 by
paragraphs 45 and 54 of Schedule 10 to the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 is
fully in force, subsection (5) has effect as if it included a reference to that Part.

information that the data subject already has.

(4)

Where personal data relating to a data subject is collected by or on behalf of the
controller from a person other than the data subject, the requirement in

54

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 4 — Intelligence services processing
Chapter 3 — Rights of the data subject

subsection (1) has effect, in relation to the personal data so collected, with the
following exceptions—
(a) the requirement does not apply in relation to processing that is
authorised by an enactment;
(b) the requirement does not apply in relation to the data subject if giving
the information to the data subject would be impossible or involve
disproportionate effort.
94

Right of access
(1)

An individual is entitled to obtain from a controller—
(a) confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning the
individual is being processed, and
(b) where that is the case—
(i) communication, in intelligible form, of the personal data of
which that individual is the data subject, and
(ii) the information set out in subsection (2).

(2)

That information is—
(a) the purposes of and legal basis for the processing;

subject to subsection (4).

(4)

The Secretary of State may by regulations—
(a) specify cases in which a controller may not charge a fee;
(b) specify the maximum amount of a fee.

(5)

Where a controller—
(a) reasonably requires further information—
(i) in order that the controller be satisfied as to the identity of the
individual making a request under subsection (1), or
(ii) to locate the information which that individual seeks, and
(b) has informed that individual of that requirement,
the controller is not obliged to comply with the request unless the controller is
supplied with that further information.

(6)

Where a controller cannot comply with the request without disclosing
information relating to another individual who can be identified from that
information, the controller is not obliged to comply with the request unless—
(a) the other individual has consented to the disclosure of the information
to the individual making the request, or

Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12)
Part 4 — Intelligence services processing
Chapter 3 — Rights of the data subject

(b)

55

it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with the request
without the consent of the other individual.

(7)

In subsection (6), the reference to information relating to another individual
includes a reference to information identifying that individual as the source of
the information sought by the request.

(8)

Subsection (6) is not to be construed as excusing a controller from
communicating so much of the information sought by the request as can be
communicated without disclosing the identity of the other individual
concerned, whether by the omission of names or other identifying particulars
or otherwise.

(9)

In determining for the purposes of subsection (6)(b) whether it is reasonable in
all the circumstances to comply with the request without the consent of the
other individual concerned, regard must be had, in particular, to—
(a) any duty of confidentiality owed to the other individual,
(b) any steps taken by the controller with a view to seeking the consent of
the other individual,
(c) whether the other individual is capable of giving consent, and
(d) any express refusal of consent by the other individual.

(10)

Subject to subsection (6), a controller must comply with a request under
subsection (1)—
(a) promptly, and
(b) in any event before the end of the applicable time period.

(11)

If a court is satisfied on the application of an individual who has made a
request under subsection (1) that the controller in question has failed to comply
with the request in contravention of this section, the court may order the
