27

SECURITY, DEFENCE, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, ETC

(1)

An agency may refuse to disclose any information requested pursuant to [rule 6] if
the disclosure of the information would be likely—
(a)
(b)

(c)

to prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international
relations of the Government of New Zealand; or
to prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government of New Zealand
on a basis of confidence by—
(i)
the Government of any other country or any agency of such a

TRADE SECRETS

(1)

Subject to subsection (2), an agency may refuse to disclose any information
requested pursuant to [rule 6] if the withholding of the information is necessary to
protect information where the making available of the information—

(b)

would disclose a trade secret; or
would be likely unreasonably to prejudice the commercial position of the
person who supplied or who is the subject of the information.

(2)

Information may not be withheld under subsection (1) if, in the circumstances of
the particular case, the withholding of that information is outweighed by other
considerations which render it desirable, in the public interest, to make the
information available.

29

OTHER REASONS FOR REFUSAL OF REQUESTS

An agency may refuse to disclose any information requested pursuant to [rule 6]
if—
(a)
(b)

(c)

(d)
(e)

(f)
(g)
(h)

(i)

the disclosure of the information would involve the unwarranted disclosure of
the affairs of another individual or of a deceased individual; or
the disclosure of the information or of information identifying the person who
supplied it, being evaluative material, would breach an express or implied
promise—
(i)
which was made to the person who supplied the information; and
(ii) which was to the effect that the information or the identity of the person
who supplied it or both would be held in confidence; or
after consultation undertaken (where practicable) by or on behalf of the
agency with an individual’s medical practitioner, the agency is satisfied
that—
(i)
the information relates to that individual; and
(ii) the disclosure of the information (being information that relates to the
physical or mental health of the individual who requested it) would be
likely to prejudice the physical or mental health of that individual; or
in the case of an individual under the age of 16, the disclosure of that
information would be contrary to that individual’s interests; or
the disclosure of that information (being information in respect of an
individual who has been convicted of an offence or is or has been detained
in custody) would be likely to prejudice the safe custody or the rehabilitation
of that individual; or
the disclosure of the information would breach legal professional privilege; or
[omitted]
the disclosure of the information, being information contained in material
placed in any library or museum or archive, would breach a condition subject
to which that material was so placed; or

House of Representatives; or
38

(ia)

(j)
(2)

An agency may refuse a request made pursuant to [rule 6] if—

for information that could be sought by the defendant under the
Criminal Disclosure Act 2008; or
(ii) for information that could be sought by the defendant under that Act
and that has been disclosed to, or withheld from, the defendant under
that Act; or
the request is frivolous or vexatious, or the information requested is trivial.

the information requested is not readily retrievable; or
the information requested does not exist or cannot be found; or
the information requested is not held by the agency and the person dealing
with the request has no grounds for believing that the information is either—
(i)
held by another agency; or
(ii) connected more closely with the functions or activities of another
agency.

For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), the term evaluative material means
evaluative or opinion material compiled solely—

agency to impose a charge in respect of either or both of those matters.

to make a request in a manner that is in accordance with the requirements of this
Act or to direct his or her request to the appropriate agency.

TRANSFER OF REQUESTS
Where—
(a)
(b)

an information privacy request is made to an agency or is transferred to an

connected with the functions or activities of another agency,—

44

the reason for withholding the information; and
if the individual so requests, the grounds in support of that reason, unless
the giving of those grounds would itself prejudice the interests protected by
section 27 or section 28 or section 29 and (in the case of the interests
protected by section 28) there is no countervailing public interest.

REASON FOR REFUSAL TO BE GIVEN
Where an information privacy request made by an individual is refused, the
agency shall,—
(a)

(b)

45

subject to section 32, give to the individual—

special circumstances of the case,—
(a)

(b)

the public interest in that collection or, as the case requires, that use or that
disclosure outweighs, to a substantial degree, any interference with the
privacy of the individual that could result from that collection or, as the case
requires, that use or that disclosure; or
that collection or, as the case requires, that use or that disclosure involves a
clear benefit to the individual concerned that outweighs any interference with
