(1)

This code applies to the following agencies:
(a) the trustees of a scheme; or
(b) the administration manager of a scheme; or
(c) any investment manager of a scheme; or
(d) any actuary performing functions in relation to a scheme; or
(e) any insurer or benefit provider supplying insurance services or other benefits to a

(2)

Subrules 13(1), (2)(a), (2)(e), (4) and (5)(a) do not apply to unique identifiers assigned
before 1 July 1993.

(3)

Subrules 13(2)(b)-(d) and (3) do not apply to unique identifiers assigned before 1
December 1995.

(4)

However, subrule 13(2) applies to the assignment of a unique identifier—
(a) on or after 1 July 1993 under subrules 13(2)(a) and (e); and
(b) on or after 1 December 1995 under subrules 13(2)(b)-(d);
even if the unique identifier assigned is the same as that assigned by another agency
before that date.

5

Rule modifying information privacy principle 13
Information privacy principle 13 is modified in accordance with the Act by the
following rule which applies to the agencies referred to in clause 4(1)—
Rule 13
Unique Identifiers

(1)

An agency (A) may assign a unique identifier to an individual for use in its operations
only if that identifier is necessary to enable A to carry out 1 or more of its functions
efficiently.

(2)

A may not assign to an individual a unique identifier that, to A’s knowledge, is the
same unique identifier as has been assigned to that individual by another agency (B),
unless—
(a) A and B are associated persons; or
(b) A is an agency described in subclause 4(1), B is the individual’s employer or
trade union or an agency of that employer and the unique identifier was devised
and assigned in connection with the individual’s employment; or

3

Superannuation Schemes Unique Identifier Code 2020

(c) A is an agency described in subclause 4(1), B is or was another agency described
in subclause 4(1) or the individual’s employer or union or an agent of that
employer or union, and the individual transferred from the scheme in respect of
which A acts as part of a restructuring of the employer’s or union’s
superannuation arrangements; or
(d) the individual to whom the unique identifier is assigned is a beneficiary deriving
their rights from an individual to whom subrule 2(b) or subrule 2(c) applies; or
(e) the unique identifier is to be used by A for statistical or research purposes and no
other purpose.
(3)

Paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of subrule (2) do not operate to exempt from subrule (2) the
assignment of a unique identifier that, to the agency’s knowledge, has originally been
assigned to that individual by an agency other than the employer, union or an agent of
the employer.

(4)

To avoid doubt, A does not assign a unique identifier to an individual under
subrule (1) by simply recording a unique identifier assigned to the individual by
another agency for the sole purpose of communicating with B about the individual.

(5)

A must take any steps that are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that—
(a) a unique identifier is assigned only to individuals whose identity is clearly
established; and
(b) the risk of misuse of a unique identifier by any person is minimised (for example,
by showing truncated account numbers on receipts or in correspondence).

(6)

An agency may not require an individual to disclose any unique identifier assigned to
that individual unless the disclosure is for one of the purposes in connection with
which that unique identifier was assigned or is for a purpose that is directly related to
one of those purposes.

6

Revocation
The Superannuation Schemes Unique Identifier Code 1995 is revoked.

Made at Wellington on 28 October 2020.
