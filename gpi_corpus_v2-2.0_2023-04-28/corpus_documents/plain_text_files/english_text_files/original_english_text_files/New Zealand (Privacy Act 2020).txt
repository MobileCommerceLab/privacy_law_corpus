(f)
that the use of the information for that other purpose is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious threat to—
(i) public health or public safety; or
(ii) the life or health of the individual concerned or another
individual.
In addition to the uses authorised by subclause (1), an intelligence and
security agency that holds personal information that was obtained in
connection with one purpose may use the information for any other purpose (a secondary purpose) if the agency believes on reasonable
grounds that the use of the information for the secondary purpose is
necessary to enable the agency to perform any of its functions.
Information privacy principle 11
Limits on disclosure of personal information
An agency that holds personal information must not disclose the information to any other agency or to any person unless the agency believes,
on reasonable grounds,—
(a)
that the disclosure of the information is one of the purposes in
connection with which the information was obtained or is
directly related to the purposes in connection with which the
information was obtained; or

that the disclosure is to the individual concerned; or
that the disclosure is authorised by the individual concerned; or
that the source of the information is a publicly available publication and that, in the circumstances of the case, it would not be
unfair or unreasonable to disclose the information; or
(e)
that the disclosure of the information is necessary—
(i) to avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law by any
public sector agency, including prejudice to the prevention,
detection, investigation, prosecution, and punishment of
offences; or
(ii) for the enforcement of a law that imposes a pecuniary penalty; or
(iii) for the protection of public revenue; or
(iv) for the conduct of proceedings before any court or tribunal
(being proceedings that have been commenced or are
reasonably in contemplation); or
(f)
that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or
lessen a serious threat to—
(i) public health or public safety; or
(ii) the life or health of the individual concerned or another
individual; or
(g)
that the disclosure of the information is necessary to enable an
intelligence and security agency to perform any of its functions;
or
(h)
that the information—
(i) is to be used in a form in which the individual concerned is
not identified; or
(ii) is to be used for statistical or research purposes and will
not be published in a form that could reasonably be expected to identify the individual concerned; or
(i)
that the disclosure of the information is necessary to facilitate
the sale or other disposition of a business as a going concern.
This IPP is subject to IPP 12.
Information privacy principle 12
Disclosure of personal information outside New Zealand
An agency (A) may disclose personal information to a foreign person or
entity (B) in reliance on IPP 11(1)(a), (c), (e), (f), (h), or (i) only if—
(a)
the individual concerned authorises the disclosure to B after
being expressly informed by A that B may not be required to

protect the information in a way that, overall, provides comparable safeguards to those in this Act; or
(b)
B is carrying on business in New Zealand and, in relation to the
information, A believes on reasonable grounds that B is subject
to this Act; or
(c)
A believes on reasonable grounds that B is subject to privacy
laws that, overall, provide comparable safeguards to those in this
Act; or
(d)
A believes on reasonable grounds that B is a participant in a prescribed binding scheme; or
(e)
A believes on reasonable grounds that B is subject to privacy
laws of a prescribed country; or
(f)
A otherwise believes on reasonable grounds that B is required to
protect the information in a way that, overall, provides comparable safeguards to those in this Act (for example, pursuant to an
agreement entered into between A and B).
However, subclause (1) does not apply if the personal information is to
be disclosed to B in reliance on IPP 11(1)(e) or (f) and it is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances for A to comply with the requirements of subclause (1).
In this IPP,—
prescribed binding scheme means a binding scheme specified in regulations made under section 213
prescribed country means a country specified in regulations made
under section 214.
Information privacy principle 13
Unique identifiers
An agency (A) may assign a unique identifier to an individual for use in
its operations only if that identifier is necessary to enable A to carry out
1 or more of its functions efficiently.
A may not assign to an individual a unique identifier that, to A’s knowledge, is the same unique identifier as has been assigned to that individual by another agency (B), unless—
(a)
A and B are associated persons within the meaning of subpart
YB of the Income Tax Act 2007; or
(b)
the unique identifier is to be used by A for statistical or research
purposes and no other purpose.
To avoid doubt, A does not assign a unique identifier to an individual
under subclause (1) by simply recording a unique identifier assigned to

31

Part 3 s 23

(4)

(5)

Privacy Act 2020

Reprinted as at

the individual by B for the sole purpose of communicating with B about
the individual.
A must take any steps that are, in the circumstances, reasonable to
ensure that—
(a)
a unique identifier is assigned only to an individual whose identity is clearly established; and
(b)
the risk of misuse of a unique identifier by any person is minimised (for example, by showing truncated account numbers on
receipts or in correspondence).
An agency may not require an individual to disclose any unique identifier assigned to that individual unless the disclosure is for one of the
purposes in connection with which that unique identifier was assigned
or is for a purpose that is directly related to one of those purposes.

Extension of time limits

(1)

On receiving an IPP 6 request, an agency may extend the time limit set out in
section 43 or 44 in respect of the request if—
(a)

the request is for a large quantity of information, or necessitates a search
through a large quantity of information, and meeting the original time
limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the agency; or

(b)

consultations necessary to make a decision on the request are such that a
response to the request cannot reasonably be given within the original
time limit; or

(c)

the processing of the request raises issues of such complexity that a
response to the request cannot reasonably be given within the original
time limit.

(2)

Any extension under subsection (1) must be for a reasonable period of time
having regard to the circumstances.

harm to an affected individual or individuals or is likely to do so (see
section 113 for factors that must be considered by an agency when
assessing whether a privacy breach is likely to cause serious harm); but

For the purposes of this subpart, the meanings of access, disclosure, and loss
are not limited by the use of those words or the meanings ascribed to them
elsewhere in this Act.

113

Assessment of likelihood of serious harm being caused by privacy breach
When an agency is assessing whether a privacy breach is likely to cause serious harm in order to decide whether the breach is a notifiable privacy breach,
the agency must consider the following:

114

(a)

any action taken by the agency to reduce the risk of harm following the
breach:

(b)

whether the personal information is sensitive in nature:

(c)

the nature of the harm that may be caused to affected individuals:

(d)

the person or body that has obtained or may obtain personal information
as a result of the breach (if known):

(e)

whether the personal information is protected by a security measure:

(f)

Agency to notify Commissioner of notifiable privacy breach
An agency must notify the Commissioner as soon as practicable after becoming aware that a notifiable privacy breach has occurred.

115

Agency to notify affected individual or give public notice of notifiable
privacy breach

(1)

An agency must notify an affected individual as soon as practicable after
becoming aware that a notifiable privacy breach has occurred, unless subsection (2) or an exception in section 116 applies or a delay is permitted under
section 116(4).

(2)

If it is not reasonably practicable to notify an affected individual or each member of a group of affected individuals, the agency must instead give public
notice of the privacy breach, unless an exception in section 116 applies or a
delay is permitted under section 116(4).

(3)

Public notice must be given—

(4)

(a)

in a form in which no affected individual is identified; and

(b)

in accordance with any regulations made under section 215(1)(a).

applies; and

(b)

at that later time, there is or remains a risk that the privacy breach will
cause serious harm to the affected individual or individuals.

77

Part 6 s 116

Privacy Act 2020

Reprinted as at

(5)

A failure to notify an affected individual or give public notice under this section may be an interference with privacy under this Act (see section
69(2)(a)(iv)).

116

Exceptions to or delay in complying with requirement to notify affected
individuals or give public notice of notifiable privacy breach

(1)

An agency is not required to notify an affected individual or give public notice
of a notifiable privacy breach if the agency believes that the notification or
notice would be likely to—

(2)

(3)

(4)

(a)

prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international
relations of the Government of New Zealand; or

(b)

prejudice the maintenance of the law by any public sector agency,
including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and
the right to a fair trial; or

(c)

endanger the safety of any person; or

(d)

reveal a trade secret.

An agency is not required to notify an affected individual or give public notice
(relating to a particular individual) of a notifiable privacy breach—
(a)

if the individual is under the age of 16 and the agency believes that the
notification or notice would be contrary to that individual’s interests; or

(b)

if, after consultation is undertaken by the agency with the individual’s
health practitioner (where practicable), the agency believes that the notification or notice would be likely to prejudice the health of the individual.

If subsection (2) applies, the agency must—
(a)

consider whether it would be appropriate to notify a representative
instead of the individual (if a representative is known or can be readily
identified); and

(b)

before deciding whether to notify a representative, take into account the
circumstances of both the individual and the privacy breach; and

(c)

if the agency decides it is appropriate to notify a representative and has
identified a representative, notify that person.

An agency may delay notifying an affected individual (or a representative) or
giving public notice of a notifiable privacy breach (but not delay notifying the
Commissioner) only—
(a)

78

if the agency believes that a delay is necessary because notification or
public notice may have risks for the security of personal information
held by the agency and those risks outweigh the benefits of informing
affected individuals; and

Reprinted as at

(b)

Privacy Act 2020

Part 6 s 117

for a period during which those risks continue to outweigh those benefits.

(5)

An agency may rely on an exception, or delay in notifying affected individuals
or giving public notice, under this section and, in relation to a delay, do so for
the period referred to in subsection (4)(b), only if the agency believes on
reasonable grounds that the exception applies, the ground for delay exists, or
the circumstances referred to in subsection (4)(b) (relating to the period of
delay) continue to exist.

(6)

In this section,—
health practitioner has the meaning given to it in section 49(2)
representative,—

A notification to an affected individual must not include any particulars about
any other affected individuals.

(5)

In order to comply with the requirement under sections 114 and 115 that notification must be made as soon as practicable, an agency may provide the information required by this section incrementally. However, any information that is

point in time.

118

It is not a defence to a charge under this section that the agency has taken steps
to address the privacy breach.

(3)

It is a defence to a charge under this section that the agency did not consider
the privacy breach to be a notifiable privacy breach, but only if it was reasonable to do so in the circumstances.

119

Section 211 does not apply to processes and proceedings relating to failure
to notify notifiable privacy breach
Section 211 (which refers to the liability of employers, principals, and agencies) does not apply to processes or proceedings under this Act relating to the

(1)

This section applies to processes and proceedings under this Act relating to the
obligations under section 114 or 115.

(2)

An employee or a member of an agency is not liable in those processes or proceedings if anything done or omitted by them results in the employer or agency
failing to notify the Commissioner or an affected person (or their representative) or give public notice of a notifiable privacy breach.

by an employee or a member of an agency is to be treated as being done or
omitted by the employer or agency.

For the purpose of those processes and proceedings, anything done or omitted
by an agent of another agency is to be treated as being done or omitted by both
the agent and the principal agency.

(5)

However, the extent of liability of an agent is affected by whether they hold
personal information that is the subject of a notifiable privacy breach. See the
definition of privacy breach in section 112 and see section 11, which applies
and which provides that information held by an agent is to be treated as being
held by the principal agency unless section 11(3) applies.

or a member of an agency is to be treated as being known by the employer or
agency.

(3)

Subsection (4) applies to processes and proceedings under this Act relating to
the obligations under section 114 or 115 except a proceeding under section 118.

(4)

Anything relating to a notifiable privacy breach that is known by an agent is to
be treated as being known by the principal agency.

122

Publication of identity of agencies in certain circumstances

(1)

The Commissioner may publish the identity of an agency that has notified the
Commissioner of a notifiable privacy breach if—

(2)

(a)

the agency consents to publication; or

(b)

the Commissioner is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.

This section does not prevent the publication of details of any notifiable privacy breach in a form in which the agency or any affected individual is not
identified and for the purpose of informing the public about the extent and
nature of privacy breaches.

193

Prohibition on transfer of personal information outside New Zealand

(1)

The Commissioner may prohibit a transfer of personal information from New
Zealand to another country if the Commissioner is satisfied, on reasonable
grounds, that—
(a)

the information has been, or will be, received in New Zealand from
another country and is likely to be transferred to a third country where it
will not be subject to a law providing comparable safeguards to those in
this Act; and

113

Part 8 s 194

(b)

(2)

(3)

Privacy Act 2020

Reprinted as at
1 April 2021

the transfer would be likely to lead to a contravention of the basic principles of national application set out in Part Two of the OECD Guidelines and in Schedule 8 of this Act.

In determining whether to prohibit a transfer of personal information, the Commissioner must also consider, in addition to the matters set out in subsection (1)
and section 21, the following:
(a)

whether the transfer affects, or is likely to affect, any individual; and

(b)

the general desirability of facilitating the free flow of information
between New Zealand and other countries; and

(c)

any existing or developing international guidelines relevant to transborder data flows, including (but not limited to)—
(i)

the OECD Guidelines:

(ii)

the General Data Protection Regulation.

Subsection (1) does not apply if the transfer of the information, or the information itself, is—
(a)

required or authorised by or under any enactment; or

(b)

required by any convention or other instrument that imposes international obligations on New Zealand.

Compare: 1993 No 28 s 114B

Commissioner may vary or cancel transfer prohibition notice

(1)

If, at any time, the Commissioner considers that all or any of the provisions of

order to avoid a contravention of basic principles of privacy or data protection,
the Commissioner may vary or cancel the transfer prohibition notice by serving
notice to that effect on the agency concerned.

(2)

An agency on whom a transfer prohibition notice has been served may, at any
time after the end of the period during which an appeal under section 198(1)(a)
can be lodged, apply in writing to the Commissioner for the notice to be varied
or cancelled under subsection (1).

(3)

The Commissioner must, within 20 working days after the date on which an

Schedule 6
Information matching rules
ss 177, 178, 189

1

Notice to individuals affected

(1)

Agencies involved in an authorised information matching programme must
take all reasonable steps (which may consist of or include public notification)
to ensure that the individuals who will be affected by the programme are notified of the programme.

(2)

Nothing in subclause (1) requires an agency to notify any individual about an
authorised information matching programme if to do so would be likely to frustrate the objective of the programme.

2

Use of unique identifiers
Except as provided in any other enactment, unique identifiers may not be used
as part of any authorised information matching programme unless their use is
essential to the success of the programme.

3

Technical standards

(1)

The agency primarily responsible for the operation of an authorised information matching programme must establish and maintain detailed technical standards to govern the operation of the programme.

(2)

The technical standards established by an agency in accordance with subclause
(1) must deal with the following matters:
(a)

(b)

(c)

the integrity of the information to be matched, with particular reference
to—
(i)

key terms and their definition; and

(ii)

relevance, timeliness, and completeness:

the matching techniques to be used in the programme, with particular
reference to—
(i)

the matching algorithm:

(ii)

any use of unique identifiers:

(iii)

the nature of the matters being sought to be identified by the
matching process:

(iv)

the relevant information definitions:

(v)

the procedure for recognising matches:

the controls being used to ensure the continued integrity of the programme, including the procedures that have been established to confirm
the validity of matching results:

151

Schedule 6

(d)

Privacy Act 2020

Reprinted as at
1 April 2021

the security features included within the programme to minimise and
audit access to personal information, including the means by which the
information is to be transferred between agencies.

(3)

The technical standards established in accordance with subclause (1) must be
incorporated in a written document (in this clause, a Technical Standards
Report), and copies of the Technical Standards Report must be held by all
agencies that are involved in the authorised information matching programme.

(4)

Variations may be made to a Technical Standards Report by way of a Variation
Report appended to the original report.

(5)

The agency that prepares a Technical Standards Report must forward a copy of
that report, and of every Variation Report appended to that report, to the Commissioner.

(6)

The Commissioner may at any time direct that a Technical Standards Report be
varied, and that direction must be complied with by the agency that prepared
the report.

(7)

Every agency involved in an authorised information matching programme must
comply with the requirements of the associated Technical Standards Report
(including any variations made to the report).

4

Safeguards for individuals affected by results of programmes

(1)

The agencies involved in an authorised information matching programme must
establish reasonable procedures for confirming the validity of discrepancies
before an agency seeks to rely on them as a basis for action in respect of an
individual.

(2)

Subclause (1) does not apply if the agencies concerned consider that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the results are not likely to be in error, and in
forming that view the agencies must have regard to the consistency in content
and context of the information being matched.

(3)

Where those confirmation procedures do not take the form of checking the
results against the source information, but instead involve direct communication with the individual affected, the agency that seeks to rely on the discrepancy as a basis for action in respect of an individual must notify the individual
affected that no check has been made against the information which formed the
basis for the information supplied for the programme.

(4)

Every notification in accordance with subclause (3) must include an explanation of the procedures that are involved in the examination of a discrepancy
revealed by the programme.

5

Destruction of information

(1)

In this clause, information matching information means—

152

Reprinted as at
1 April 2021

Privacy Act 2020

Schedule 6

(a)

information that is disclosed to an agency under an information matching provision for use in an authorised information matching programme;
and

(b)

information that is produced from an authorised information matching
programme.

(2)

Information matching information held by an agency that does not reveal a discrepancy must be destroyed as soon as practicable by the agency.

(3)

An agency that holds information matching information that reveals a discrepancy must destroy that information within 60 working days after becoming
aware of the discrepancy unless the agency decides to take adverse action
against any individual on the basis of that discrepancy.

(4)

An agency that decides to take adverse action against any individual on the
basis of a discrepancy must destroy the information as soon as practicable after
the information is no longer required.

(5)

This clause does not apply in relation to the Inland Revenue Department.

6

No new databank

(1)

Subject to subclauses (2) and (3), the agencies involved in an authorised information matching programme must not permit the information used in the programme to be linked or merged in such a way that a new separate permanent
register or databank of information is created about all or any of the individuals
whose information has been subject to the programme.

(2)

Subclause (1) does not prevent an agency from maintaining a register of individuals in respect of whom further inquiries are warranted following a discrepancy revealed by the programme, but information relating to an individual may
be maintained on a register of that kind only for so long as is necessary to
enable those inquiries to be carried out, and in no case longer than is necessary
to enable any adverse action to be taken against an individual.

(3)

Subclause (1) does not prevent an agency from maintaining a register for the
purpose of excluding individuals from being selected for investigation, but that
register may contain only the minimum amount of information necessary for
that purpose.
