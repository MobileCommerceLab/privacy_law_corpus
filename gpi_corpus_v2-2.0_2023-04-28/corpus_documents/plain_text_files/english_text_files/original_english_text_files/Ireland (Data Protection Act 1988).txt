to request him or her to cease within a reasonable time, or not to begin, processing
or processing for a specified purpose or in a specified manner any personal data in
respect of which he or she is the data subject if the processing falls within subsection

P ERSONAL D ATA DONE AT S TRASBOURG ON THE 28 TH DAY OF J ANUARY ,
1981
FOR THE

PREAMBLE
The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto,
Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity between
its members, based in particular on respect for the rule of law, as well as human rights
and fundamental freedoms;
Considering that it is desirable to extend the safeguards for everyone’s rights and
fundamental freedoms, and in particular the right to the respect for privacy, taking
account of the increasing flow across frontiers of personal data undergoing automatic
processing;
Reaffirming at the same time their commitment to freedom of information regardless
of frontiers;
Recognising that it is necessary to reconcile the fundamental values of the respect
for privacy and the free flow of information between peoples,
Have agreed as follows:

CHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article 1
Object and purpose
The purpose of this convention is to secure in the territory of each Party for every
individual, whatever his nationality or residence, respect for his rights and fundamental
freedoms, and in particular his right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing
of personal data relating to him (“data protection”).
Article 2
Definitions
For the purposes of this convention:
a. “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
individual (“data subject”);
b. “automated data file” means any set of data undergoing automatic processing;
c. “automatic processing” includes the following operations if carried out in
whole or in part by automated means: storage of data, carrying out of logical and/or
arithmetical operations on those data, their alteration, erasure, retrieval or dissemination;
d. “controller of the file” means the natural or legal person, public authority,
agency or any other body who is competent according to the national law to decide
what should be the purpose of the automated data file, which categories of personal
data should be stored and which operations should be applied to them.
Article 3

84

SCH. 1

[No. 25.]

Data Protection Act 1988

[1988.]

Scope
1. The Parties undertake to apply this convention to automated personal data files
and automatic processing of personal data in the public and private sectors.
2. Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of
ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any later time, give notice by a
declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe:
a. that it will not apply this convention to certain categories of automated
personal data files, a list of which will be deposited. In this list it shall not include,
however, categories of automated data files subject under its domestic law to data
protection provisions. Consequently, it shall amend this list by a new declaration
whenever additional categories of automated personal data files are subjected to
data protection provisions under its domestic law;
b. that it will also apply this convention to information relating to groups of
persons, associations, foundations, companies, corporations and any other bodies
consisting directly or indirectly of individuals, whether or not such bodies possess
legal personality;
c. that it will also apply this convention to personal data files which are not
processed automatically.
3. Any State which has extended the scope of this convention by any of the declarations provided for in sub-paragraph 2.b or c above may give notice in the said declaration that such extensions shall apply only to certain categories of personal data
files, a list of which will be deposited.
4. Any Party which has excluded certain categories of automated personal data files
by a declaration provided for in sub-paragraph 2.a above may not claim the application
of this convention to such categories by a Party which has not excluded them.
5. Likewise, a Party which has not made one or other of the extensions provided
for in sub-paragraphs 2.b or c above may not claim the application of this convention
on these points with respect to a Party which has made such extensions.
6. The declarations provided for in paragraph 2 above shall take effect from the
moment of the entry into force of the convention with regard to the State which has
made them if they have been made at the time of signature or deposit of its instrument
of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or three months after their receipt
by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe if they have been made at any later
time. These declarations may be withdrawn, in whole or in part, by a notification
addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. Such withdrawals shall
take effect three months after the date of receipt of such notification.

CHAPTER II—BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR DATA PROTECTION
Article 4
Duties of the Parties

to the basic principles for data protection set out in this chapter.
2. These measures shall be taken at the latest at the time of entry into force of this

Quality of data
85

SCH. 1

[No. 25.]

Data Protection Act 1988

[1988.]

Personal data undergoing automatic processing shall be:
a. obtained and processed fairly and lawfully;
b. stored for specified and legitimate purposes and not used in a way incompatible with those purposes;
c. adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which
they are stored;
d. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date;
e. preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no
longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored.
Article 6
Special categories of data
Personal data revealing racial origin, political opinions or religious or other beliefs,
as well as personal data concerning health or sexual life, may not be processed
automatically unless domestic law provides appropriate safeguards. The same shall
apply to personal data relating to criminal convictions.
Article 7
Data security
Appropriate security measures shall be taken for the protection of personal data
stored in automated data files against accidental or unauthorised destruction or
accidental loss as well as against unauthorised access, alteration or dissemination.
Article 8
Additional safeguards for the data subject
Any person shall be enabled:
a. to establish the existence of an automated personal data file, its main
purposes, as well as the identity and habitual residence or principal place of business
of the controller of the file;
b. to obtain at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense
confirmation of whether personal data relating to him are stored in the automated
data file as well as communication to him of such data in an intelligible form;
c. to obtain, as the case may be, rectification or erasure of such data if these
have been processed contrary to the provisions of domestic law giving effect to the
basic principles set out in Articles 5 and 6 of this convention;
d. to have a remedy if a request for confirmation or, as the case may be,
communication, rectification or erasure as referred to in paragraphs b and c of this
article is not complied with.
Article 9
Exceptions and restrictions
1. No exception to the provisions of Articles 5, 6 and 8 of this convention shall be
allowed except within the limits defined in this article.
2. Derogation from the provisions of Articles 5, 6 and 8 of this convention shall be
allowed when such derogation is provided for by the law of the Party and constitutes
a necessary measure in a democratic society in the interests of:

86

SCH. 1

[No. 25.]

Data Protection Act 1988

[1988.]

a. protecting State security, public safety, the monetary interests of the State
or the suppression of criminal offences;
b. protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others.
3. Restrictions on the exercise of the rights specified in Article 8, paragraphs b, c
and d, may be provided by law with respect to automated personal data files used
for statistics or for scientific research purposes when there is obviously no risk of an
infringement of the privacy of the data subjects.
Article 10
Sanctions and remedies
Each Party undertakes to establish appropriate sanctions and remedies for violations
of provisions of domestic law giving effect to the basic principles for data protection
set out in this chapter.
Article 11
Extended protection
None of the provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted as limiting or otherwise
affecting the possibility for a Party to grant data subjects a wider measure of
protection than that stipulated in this convention.

CHAPTER III—TRANSBORDER DATA FLOWS
Article 12
Transborder flows of personal data and domestic law
1. The following provisions shall apply to the transfer across national borders, by
whatever medium, of personal data undergoing automatic processing or collected
with a view to their being automatically processed.
2. A Party shall not, for the sole purpose of the protection of privacy, prohibit or
subject to special authorisation transborder flows of personal data going to the
territory of another Party.
3. Nevertheless, each Party shall be entitled to derogate from the provisions of
paragraph 2:
a. insofar as its legislation includes specific regulations for certain categories of
personal data or of automated personal data files, because of the nature of those
data or those files, except where the regulations of the other Party provide an
equivalent protection;
b. when the transfer is made from its territory to the territory of a nonContracting State through the intermediary of the territory of another Party, in order
to avoid such transfers resulting in circumvention of the legislation of the Party
referred to at the beginning of this paragraph.
