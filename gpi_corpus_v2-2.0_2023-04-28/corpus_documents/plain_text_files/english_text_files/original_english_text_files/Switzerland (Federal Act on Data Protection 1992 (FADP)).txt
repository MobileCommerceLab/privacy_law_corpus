General Data Protection Provisions

Art. 4

Principles

1

Personal data may only be processed lawfully.7

2

Its processing must be carried out in good faith and must be proportionate.

Personal data may only be processed for the purpose indicated at the time of collection, that is evident from the circumstances, or that is provided for by law.

3

The collection of personal data and in particular the purpose of its processing must
be evident to the data subject.8

4

If the consent of the data subject is required for the processing of personal data,
such consent is valid only if given voluntarily on the provision of adequate information. Additionally, consent must be given expressly in the case of processing of
sensitive personal data or personality profiles.9

5

Art. 5

Correctness of the data

Anyone who processes personal data must make certain that it is correct. He must
take all reasonable measures to ensure that data that is incorrect or incomplete in
view of the purpose of its collection is either corrected or destroyed.10

1

2

Any data subject may request that incorrect data be corrected.

Art. 611

Cross-border disclosure

Personal data may not be disclosed abroad if the privacy of the data subjects would
be seriously endangered thereby, in particular due to the absence of legislation that
guarantees adequate protection.

Data Protection

a.

sufficient safeguards, in particular contractual clauses, ensure an adequate
level of protection abroad;

b.

the data subject has consented in the specific case;

c.

the processing is directly connected with the conclusion or the performance
of a contract and the personal data is that of a contractual party;

d.

disclosure is essential in the specific case in order either to safeguard an
overriding public interest or for the establishment, exercise or enforcement of
legal claims before the courts;

e.

disclosure is required in the specific case in order to protect the life or the
physical integrity of the data subject;

f.

the data subject has made the data generally accessible and has not expressly
prohibited its processing;

g.

disclosure is made within the same legal person or company or between legal
persons or companies that are under the same management, provided those
involved are subject to data protection rules that ensure an adequate level of
protection.

The Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (the Commissioner,
Art. 26) must be informed of the safeguards under paragraph 2 letter a and the data
protection rules under paragraph 2 letter g. The Federal Council regulates the details
of this duty to provide information.

this is required to protect the overriding interests of third parties.

A federal body may further refuse, restrict or defer the provision of information
where:

2

a.

this is required to protect overriding public interests, and in particular the internal or external security of the Confederation;

b.

the information would jeopardise the outcome of a criminal investigation or
any other investigation proceedings.

As soon as the reason for refusing, restricting or deferring the provision of information ceases to apply, the federal body must provide the information unless this is
impossible or only possible with disproportionate inconvenience or expense.

3

The private controller of a data file may further refuse, restrict or defer the provision of information where his own overriding interests so require and he does not
disclose the personal data to third parties.

Private persons must declare their data files if:
a.

they regularly process sensitive personal data or personality profiles; or

b.

they regularly disclose personal data to third parties.

The data files must be declared before they are opened.

In derogation from the provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3, the controller of data files
is not required to declare his files if:

5

party, by an overriding private or public interest or by law.
1

An overriding interest of the person processing the data shall in particular be considered if that person:

2

a.

processes personal data in direct connection with the conclusion or the performance of a contract and the personal data is that of a contractual party;

b.

is or intends to be in commercial competition with another and for this purpose processes personal data without disclosing the data to third parties;

c.

process data that is neither sensitive personal data nor a personality profile in
order to verify the creditworthiness of another, and discloses such data to
third parties only if the data is required for the conclusion or the performance
of a contract with the data subject;

d.

processes personal data on a professional basis exclusively for publication in
the edited section of a periodically published medium;

e.

processes personal data for purposes not relating to a specific person, in particular for the purposes of research, planning and statistics and publishes the
results in such a manner that the data subjects may not be identified;

general accessible and has not expressly prohibited its processing.26

Art. 17a27

Automated data processing in pilot projects

The Federal Council may, having consulted the Commissioner and before a formal
enactment comes into force, approve the automated processing of sensitive personal
data or personality profiles if:

1

a.

the tasks that require such processing required are regulated in a formal enactment;

b.

adequate measures are taken to prevent breaches of privacy;

c.

a test phase before the formal enactment comes into force is indispensable
for the practical implementation of data processing.

27

10

a.

the fulfilment of a task requires technical innovations, the effects of which
must first be evaluated;

b.

the fulfilment of a task requires significant organisational or technical
measures, the effectiveness of which must first be tested, in particular in the
case of cooperation between federal and the cantonal bodies; or

c.

processing requires that sensitive personal data or personality profiles be
transmitted online to cantonal authorities.
