the list of the kind of processing operations for which a data
protection impact assessment is not required
The Commission nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (French Data Protection
Authority),
Having regard to Convention no. 108 of the Council of Europe for the protection of
individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data;
Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing
Directive 95/46/EC, particularly its article 35;
Having regard to Act no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978, amended, on information
technology, data files and civil liberties;
Having regard to Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019, amended, implementing Act
no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties;
Having regard to Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and
determining whether processing is “likely to result in a high risk” for the purposes of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 adopted on 4 April 2017;
Having regard to opinion 19/2019 of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) on
the draft list of the French supervisory authority regarding the kind of processing
operations for which an impact assessment regarding data protection is not required
(article 35.5 of the GDPR), adopted on 10 July 2019;
Having heard the report of Ms Anne Debet, commissioner, and the observations of
Ms Nacima Belkacem, government commissioner
Makes the following observations:
Article 35.1 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (GDPR) lays down that a
data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be conducted when a processing “is
likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”.
Article 35.5 of the GDPR allows supervisory authorities to establish and publish the
list of the kind of processing operations for which data protection impact assessment
is not required.
Article 35.6 of the GDPR lays down that, when this list involves “processing activities
which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the
monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect
the free movement of personal data within the Union”, the “consistency” mechanism
shall apply and must be communicated to the European Data Protection Board
(EDPB).

On 29 March 2019, a draft list was adopted by the Commission and submitted to the
EDPB on 3 April 2019. The EDPB adopted an opinion regarding this draft on 10 July
2019, which was notified to the Commission on 12 July 2019.
Decides:
The list appended to this deliberation, on the kind of processing operations for which
a data protection impact assessment is not required, is adopted.
This list completes and specifies the guidelines adopted by the Commission on 11
October 2018.
Although the presence of a processing operation on the current list dispenses from an
impact assessment, the controller remains subject to all other obligations in
application of the GDPR and the Act of 6th January 1978. In particular, the fact that a
processing operation is included on this list does not exempt a controller from the
obligations set out in article 32 of the GDPR in terms of processing safety.
This decision will be published in the Official Journal of the French Republic.
