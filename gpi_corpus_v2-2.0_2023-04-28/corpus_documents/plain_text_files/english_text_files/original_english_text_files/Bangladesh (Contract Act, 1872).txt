OF THE COMMUNICATION, ACCEPTANCE AND REVOCATION OF PROPOSALS
Communication,
acceptance and revocation
of proposals

3. The communication of proposals, the acceptance of proposals, and the revocation of proposals and acceptances, respectively, are deemed to be
made by any act or omission of the party proposing, accepting or revoking by which he intends to communicate such proposal, acceptance or
revocation, or which has the effect of communicating it.

Communication when
complete

4. The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made.
The communication of an acceptance is complete,–
as against the proposer, when it is put in a course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor;
as against the acceptor, when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer.
The communication of a revocation is complete,as against the person who makes it, when it is put into a course of transmission to the person to whom it is made, so as to be out of the power of the
person who makes it;
as against the person to whom it is made, when it comes to his knowledge.
Illustrations
(a) A proposes, by letter, to sell a house to B at a certain price.
The communication of the proposal is complete when B receives the letter.
(b) B accepts A's proposal by a letter sent by post.
The communication of the acceptance is complete,–
as against A, when the letter is posted;
as against B, when the letter is received by A.
(c) A revokes his proposal by telegram.
The revocation is complete as against A when the telegram is despatched. It is complete as against B when B receives it.
B revokes his acceptance by telegram. B's revocation is complete as against B when the telegram is despatched, and as against A when it reaches
him.

Revocation of proposals
and acceptances

5. A proposal may be revoked at any time before the communication of its acceptance is complete as against the proposer, but not afterwards.
An acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the acceptance is complete as against the acceptor, but not afterwards.
Illustrations
A proposes, by a letter sent by post, to sell his house to B.
B accepts the proposal by a letter sent by post.
A may revoke his proposal at any time before or at the moment when B posts his letter of acceptance, but not afterwards.
B may revoke his acceptance as any time before or at the moment when the letter communicating it reaches A, but not afterwards.

Revocation how made

6. A proposal is revoked –
(1) by the communication of notice of revocation by the proposer to the other party;
(2) by the laps of the time prescribed in such proposal for its acceptance, or, if no time is so prescribed, by the lapse of a reasonable time, without
communication of the acceptance;
(3) by the failure of the acceptor to fulfil a condition precedent to acceptance; or
(4) by the death or insanity of the proposer, if the fact of his death or insanity comes to the knowledge of the acceptor before acceptance.

Acceptance must be
absolute

7. In order to convert a proposal into a promise, the acceptance must(1) be absolute and unqualified;
(2) be expressed in some usual and reasonable manner, unless the proposal prescribes the manner in which it is to be accepted. If the proposal
prescribes a manner in which it is to be accepted, and the acceptance is not made in such manner, the proposer may, within a reasonable time after
the acceptance is communicated to him, insist that his proposal shall be accepted in the prescribed manner, and not otherwise; but if he fails to do
so, he accepts the acceptance.

Acceptance by performing,
conditions, or receiving
consideration

8. Performance of the conditions of a proposal, or the acceptance of any consideration for a reciprocal promise which may be offered with a
proposal, is an acceptance of the proposal.

Promises, express and
implied

9. In so far as the proposal or acceptance of any promise is made in words, the promise is said to be express. In so far as such proposal or
acceptance is made otherwise than in words, the promise is said to be implied.

OF CONTRACTS, VOIDABLE CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS
What agreements are
contracts

10. All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful
object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void.
Nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in Bangladesh, and not hereby expressly repealed, by which any contract is required to be
made in writing or in the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration of documents.

Who are competent to
contract

11. Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind, and is
not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject.

What is a sound mind for
the purposes of
contracting

12. A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and
of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests.
A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind.
A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind.
Illustrations
(a) A patient in a lunatic asylum, who is at intervals of sound mind, may contract during those intervals.
(b) A sane man, who is delirious from fever or who is so drunk that he cannot understand the terms of a contract or form a rational judgment as to its
effect on his interests, cannot contract whilst such delirium or drunkenness lasts.

"Consent” defined

13. Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense.

"Free consent" defined

14. Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by(1) coercion, as defined in section 15, or
(2) undue influence, as defined in section 16,or
(3) fraud, as defined in section 17, or
(4) misrepresentation, as defined in section 18, or
(5) mistake, subject to the provisions of sections 20, 21 and 22.
Consent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for the existence of such coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation
or mistake.

"Coercion" defined

15. "Coercion" is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Penal Code or the unlawful detaining or threatening to detain,
any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.
Explanation - It is immaterial whether the Penal Code is or is not in force in the place where the coercion is employed.
Illustrations
A, on board an English ship on the high seas, causes B to enter into an agreement by an act amounting to criminal intimidation under the Penal
Code.
A afterwards sues B for breach of contract at Chittagong.
A has employed coercion, although his act is not an offence by the law of England, and although section 506 of the Penal Code was not in force at
the time when or place where the act was done.

"Undue influence" defined

16.(1) A contract is said to be induced by "undue influence" where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a
position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.
(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of
another(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other or where he stands in a fiduciary relation to the other; or
(b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, or mental or
bodily distress.
(3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters into a contract with him, and the transaction appears, on the face of it
or on the evidence adduced, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the
person in a position to dominate the will of the other.
Nothing in this sub-section shall affect the provisions of section 111 of the Evidence Act, 1872.
Illustrations
(a) A having advanced money to his son, B, during his minority, upon B's coming of age obtains, by misuse of parental influence, a bond from B for a
greater amount than the sum due in respect of the advance. A employs undue influence.
(b) A, a man enfeebled by disease or age, is induced, by B's influence over him as his medical attendant, to agree to pay B an unreasonable sum for
his professional services. B employs undue influence.
(c) A, being in debt to B, the money-lender of his village, contracts a fresh loan on terms which appear to be unconscionable. It lies on B to prove that
the contract was not induced by undue influence.
(d) A applies to a banker for a loan at a time when there is stringency in the money market. The banker declines to make the loan except at an
unusually high rate of interest. A accepts the loan on these terms. This is a transaction in the ordinary course of business, and the contract is not
induced by undue influence.

"Fraud" defined

17. "Fraud" means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to
deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true;
(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact;
(3) a promise made without any intention of performing it;
(4) any other act fitted to deceive;
(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent.
Explanation – Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the
case are such that, regard being had to them, it is the duty of the person keeping silence to speak, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to
speech.
Illustrations
(a) A sells, by auction, to B, a horse which A knows to be unsound. A says nothing to B about the horse's unsoundness. This is not fraud in A.
(b) B is A's daughter and has just come of age. Here, the relation between the parties would make it A's duty to tell B if the horse is unsound.
(c) B says to A-"If you do not deny it, I shall assume that the horse is sound." A says nothing. Here, A's silence is equivalent to speech.
(d) A and B, being traders, enter upon a contract. A has private information of a change in prices which would affect B's willingness to proceed with
the contract. A is not bound to inform B.

"Misrepresentation"
defined

18. “Misrepresentation" means and includes–
(1) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be
true;
(2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person committing it, or any one claiming under him, by
misleading another to his prejudice or to the prejudice of any one claiming under him;
(3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement.

Viodability of agreements
without free consent

19. When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract viodable at the option of the party
whose consent was so caused.
A party to a contract, whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation, may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and
that he shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representations made had been true.
Exception.–If such consent was caused by misrepresenta-tion or by silence, fraudulent within the meaning of section 17, the contract, nevertheless,
is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so caused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence.
Explanation – A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party on whom such fraud was practised, or to whom
such misrepresentation was made, does not render a contract voidable.
Illustrations
(a) A, intending to deceive B, falsely represents that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A's factory, and thereby induces B to buy
the factory. The contract is voidable at the option of B.
(b) A, by a misrepresentation, leads B erroneously to believe that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A's factory. B examines the
accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made. After this B buys the factory. The contract is not
voidable on account of A's misrepresentation.
(c) A fraudulently informs B that A's estate is free from encumbrance. B thereupon buys the estate. The estate is subject to a mortgage. B may either
avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the mortgage-debt redeemed.
(d) B, having discovered a vein of ore on the estate of A, adopts means to conceal, and does conceal, the existence of the ore from A. Through A's
ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an under-value. The contract is voidable at the option of A.
(e) A is entitled to succeed to an estate at the death of B; B dies: C, having received intelligence of B's death, prevents the intelligence reaching A,
and thus induces A to sell him his interest in the estate. The sale is voidable at the option of A.

Power to set aside
contract induced by undue
influence

[19A. When consent to an agreement is caused by undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent
was so caused.
2

Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was entitled to avoid it has received any benefit thereunder, upon such
terms and conditions as to the Court may seem just.
Illustrations
(a) A's son has forged B's name to a promissory note. B, under threat of prosecuting A's son, obtains a bond from A for the amount of the forged
note. If B sues on this bond, the Court may set the bond aside.
(b) A, a money-lender, advances Taka 100 to B, an agriculturist, and, by undue influence, induces B to execute a bond for Taka 200 with interest at 6
per cent per month. The Court may set the bond aside, ordering B to repay the Taka 100 with such interest as may seem just.]

Agreement void where
both parties are under
mistake as to matter of fact

20. Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.
Explanation - An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to
a matter of fact.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees to sell to B a specific cargo of goods supposed to be on its way from England to 3[Chittagong]. It turns out that, before the day of the
bargain, the ship conveying the cargo had been cast away and the goods lost. Neither party was aware of the facts. The agreement is void.
(b) A agrees to buy from B a certain horse. It turns out that the horse was dead at the time of the bargain, though neither party was aware of the fact.
The agreement is void.
(c) A, being entitled to an estate for the life of B, agrees to sell it to C. B was dead at the time of the agreement, but both parties were ignorant of the
fact. The agreement is void.

Effect of mistakes as to
law

21. A contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in Bangladesh; but a mistake as to a law not in force in
Bangladesh has the same effect as a mistake of fact.
4

[* * *]

Illustration
A and B make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Bangladesh Law of Limitation: the contract is not
voidable.
Contract caused by
mistake of one party as to
matter of fact

22. A contract is not voidable merely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being under a mistake as to a matter of fact.

What considerations and
objects are lawful and
what not

23. The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless- it is forbidden by law; or
is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or
is fraudulent; or
involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy.
In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is
unlawful is void.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees to sell his house to B for 10,000 Taka. Here B's promise to pay the sum of 10,000 Taka is the consideration for A's promise to sell the
house, and A's promise to sell the house is the consideration for B's promise to pay the 10,000 Taka. These are lawful considerations.
(b) A promises to pay B 1,000 Taka at the end of six months; if C, who owes that sum to B, fails to pay it. B promises to grant time to C accordingly.
Here the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the other party and they are lawful considerations.
(c) A promises, for a certain sum paid to him by B, to make good to B the value of his ship if it is wrecked on a certain voyage. Here A's promise is
the consideration for B's payment and B's payment is the consideration for A's promise and these are lawful considerations.
(d) A promises to maintain B's child and B's promises to pay A 1,000 Taka yearly for the purpose. Here the promise of each party is the consideration
for the promise of the other party. They are lawful considerations.
(e) A, B and C enter into an agreement for the division among them of gains acquired, or to be acquired, by them by fraud. The agreement is void, as
its object is unlawful.
(f) A promises to obtain for B an employment in the public service, and B promises to pay 1,000 Taka to A. The agreement is void, as the
consideration for it is unlawful.
(g) A, being agent for a landed proprietor, agrees for money, without the knowledge of his principal, to obtain for B a lease of land belonging to his
principal. The agreement between A and B is void, as it implies a fraud by concealment by A, on his principal.
(h) A promises B to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against B for robbery, and B promises to restore the value of the things taken. The
agreement is void, as its object is unlawful.
(i) A's estate is sold for arrears of revenue under the provisions of an Act of the Legislature, by which the defaulter is prohibited from purchasing the
estate. B, upon an understanding with A, becomes the purchaser, and agrees to convey the estate to A upon receiving from him the price which B
has paid. The agreement is void, as it renders the transaction, in effect, a purchase by the defaulter, and would so defeat the object of the law.
(j) A, who is B's mukhtar, promises to exercise his influence, as such, with B in favour of C, and C promises to pay 1,000 Taka to A. The agreement is
void, because it is immoral.
(k) A agrees to let her daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The agreement is void, because it is immoral, though the letting may not be punishable
under the Penal Code.
Void Agreements

Agreements void, if
considerations and objects
unlawful in part

24. If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of several considerations for a single object is
unlawful, the agreement is void.
Illustration
A promises to superintend, on behalf of B, a legal manufacture of indigo, and an illegal traffic in other articles. B promises to pay to A a salary of
10,000 Taka a year. The agreement is void, the object of A's promise and the considerations B's promise being in part unlawful.

Agreement without
consideration void, unless
it is in writing and
registered, or is a promise
to compensate for
something done, or is a
promise to pay a debt
barred by limitation law

25. An agreement made without consideration is void, unless–
(1) it is expressed in writing and registered under the law for the time being in force for the registration of documents, and is made on account of
natural love and affection between parties standing in a near relation to each other; or unless
(2) it is a promise to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily done something for the promisor, or something which the
promisor was legally compellable to do, or unless
(3) it is a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by his agent generally or specially authorized in that behalf,
to pay wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation of suits.
In any of these cases, such an agreement is a contract.
Explanation 1 – Nothing in this section shall affect the validity, as between the donor and donee, of any gift actually made.
Explanation 2 – An agreement to which the consent of the promisor is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate; but
the inadequacy of the consideration may be taken into account by the Court in determining the question whether the consent of the promisor was
freely given.
Illustrations
(a) A promises, for no consideration, to give to B Taka 1,000. This is a void agreement.
(b) A, for natural love and affection, promises to give his son, B, Taka 1,000. A puts his promise to B into writing and registers it. This is a contract.
(c) A finds B's purse and gives it to him. B promises to give A Taka 50. This is a contract.
(d) A supports B's infant son. B promises to pay A's expenses in so doing. This is a contract.
(e) A owes B Taka 1,000, but the debt is barred by the Limitation Act. A signs a written promise to pay B Taka 500 on account of the debt. This is a
contract.
(f) A agrees to sell a horse worth Taka 1,000 for Taka 10. A's consent to the agreement was freely given. The agreement is a contract
notwithstanding the inadequacy of the consideration.
(g) A agrees to sell a horse worth Taka 1,000 for Taka 10. A denies that his consent to the agreement was freely given.
The inadequacy of the consideration is a fact which the Court should take into account in considering whether or not A's consent was freely given.

Agreement in restraint of
marriage void

26. Every agreement in restrain of the marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void.

Agreement in restraint of
trade void Saving of
agreement not to carry on
business of which goodwill is sold

27. Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void.

Agreements in restraint of
legal proceedings void
Saving of contract to refer
to arbitration dispute that
may arise Suits barred by
such contracts Saving of
contract to refer questions
that have already arisen

28. Every agreement, by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under or in respect of any contract, by the usual
legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights, is void to that extent.

Agreements void for
uncertainty

29. Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable of being made certain, are void.

Exception 1.–One who sells the good-will of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business, within specified local
limits, so long as the buyer, or any person deriving title to the good-will from him, carries on a like business therein: Provided that such limits appear
to the Court reasonable, regard being had to the nature of the business.
Exception 2 and 3. [Repealed by section 73 and 2nd Schedule of the Partnership Act, 1932 (Act No. IX of 1932).]

Exception 1.–This section shall not render illegal a contract by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which may arise between them in
respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only the amount awarded in such arbitration shall be recoverable
in respect of the dispute so referred.
Exception 2.-Nor shall this section render illegal any contract in writing, by which two or more persons agree to refer to arbitration any question
between them which has already arisen, or affect any provision of any law in force for the time being as to references to arbitration.

Illustrations
(a) A agrees to sell to B "a hundred tons of oil". There is nothing whatever to show what kind of oil was intended. The agreement is void for
uncertainty.
(b) A agrees to sell to B one hundred tons of oil of a specified description, known as an article of commerce. There is no uncertainty here to make the
agreement void.
(c) A, who is a dealer in coconut-oil only, agrees to sell to B "one hundred tons of oil". The nature of A's trade affords an indication of the meaning of
the words, and A has entered into a contract for the sale of one hundred tons of Coconut-oil.
(d) A agrees to sell B "all the grain in my granary at 5[Rangpur]". There is no uncertainty here to make the agreement void.
(e) A agrees to sell to B "one thousand mounds of rice at a price to be fixed by C". As the price is capable of being made certain, there is no
uncertainty here to make the agreement void.
(f) A agrees to sell to B "my white horse for Taka five hundred or Taka one thousand". There is nothing to show which of the two prices was to be
given. The agreement is void.

Agreements by way of
wager void Exceptions in
favour of certain prizes for
horse-racing. Section 294A

অধ#ায় এর নাম III
OF CONTINGENT CONTRACTS
"Contingent contract"
defined

31. A "contingent contract" is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen.
Illustration
A contracts to pay B Taka 10,000 if B's house is burnt. This is a contingent contract.

Enforcement of contracts
contingent on an event
happening

32. Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event happens cannot be enforced by law unless and until that event has
happened.
If the event becomes impossible, such contracts become void.
Illustrations
(a) A makes a contract with B to buy B's horse if A survives C. This contract cannot be enforced by law unless and until C dies in A's lifetime.
(b) A makes a contract with B to sell a horse to B at a specified price, if C, to whom the horse has been offered, refuses to buy him. The contract
cannot be enforced by law unless and until C refuses to buy the horse.
(c) A contracts to pay B a sum of money when B marries C. C dies without being married to B. The contract becomes void.

Enforcement of contracts
contingent on an event not
happening

33. Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event does not happen can be enforced when the happening of that event
becomes impossible, and not before.
Illustration
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return. The ship is sunk. The contract can be enforced when the ship sinks.

When event on which
contract is contingent to
be deemed impossible, if it
is the future conduct of a
living person

34. If the future event on which a contract is contingent is the way in which a person will act at an unspecified time, the event shall be considered to
become impossible when such person does anything which renders it impossible that he should so act within any definite time, or otherwise than
under further contingencies.
Illustration
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if B marries C.
C marries D. The marriage of B to C must now be considered impossible, although it is possible that D may die and that C may afterwards marry B.

When contracts become
void which are contingent
on happening of specified
event within fixed time

35. Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain event happens within a fixed time become void if, at the expiration of the
time fixed, such event has not happened, or if, before the time fixed, such event becomes impossible.

When contracts may be
enforced which are
contingent on specified
event not happening within
fixed time

Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain event does not happen within a fixed time may be enforced by law when the
time fixed has expired and such event has not happened or, before the time fixed has expired, if it becomes certain that such event will not happen.
Illustrations
(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship returns within a year. The contract may be enforced if the ship returns within the year, and
becomes void if the ship is burnt within the year.
(b) A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return within a year. The contract may be enforced if the ship does not return within
the year, or is burnt within the year.

Agreement contingent on
impossible events void

36. Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything, if an impossible event happens, are void, whether the impossibility of the event is known or
not to the parties to the agreement at the time when it is made.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees to pay B 1,000 Taka if two straight lines should enclose a space. The agreement is void.
(b) A agrees to pay B 1,000 Taka if B will marry A's daughter C. C was dead at the time of the agreement. The agreement is void.

OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS
Contracts which must be performed
Obligation of parties to
contracts

37. The parties to a contract must either perform, or offer to perform, their respective promises, unless such performance is dispensed with or
excused under the provisions of this Act, or of any other law.
Promises bind the representatives of the promisors in case of the death of such promisors before performance, unless a contrary intention appears
from the contract.
Illustrations
(a) A promises to deliver goods to B on a certain day on payment of Taka 1,000. A dies before that day. A's representatives are bound to deliver the
goods to B, and B is bound to pay the Taka 1,000 to A's representatives.
(b) A promises to paint a picture for B by a certain day, at a certain price. A dies before the day. The contract cannot be enforced either by A's
representatives or by B.

Effect of refusal to accept
offer of performance

38. Where a promisor has made an offer of performance to the promisee, and the offer has not been accepted, the promisor is not responsible for
non-performance, nor does he thereby lose his rights under the contract.
Every such offer must fulfil the following conditions:–
(1) it must be unconditional:
(2) it must be made at a proper time and place, and under such circumstances that the person to whom it is made may have a reasonable
opportunity of ascertaining that the person by whom it is made is able and willing there and then to do the whole of what he is bound by his promise
to do:
(3) if the offer is an offer to deliver anything to the promisee, the promisee must have a reasonable opportunity of seeing that the thing offered is the
thing which the promisor is bound by his promise to deliver.
An offer to one of several joint promisees has the same legal consequences as an offer to all of them.
Illustration
A contracts to deliver to B at his warehouse, on the 1st March, 1873, 100 bales of cotton of a particular quality. In order to make an offer of a
performance with the effect stated in this section, A must bring the cotton to B's warehouse, on the appointed day, under such circumstances that B
may have a reasonable opportunity of satisfying himself that the thing offered is cotton of the quality contracted for, and that there are 100 bales.

Effect of refusal of party to
perform promise wholly

39. When a party to a contract has refused to perform, or disabled himself from performing his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end to
the contract, unless he has signified, by words or conduct, his acquiescence in its continuance.
Illustrations
(a) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theater two nights in every week during the next two months, and
B engages to pay her 100 Taka for each nights performance. On the sixth night A wilfully absents herself from the theatre. B is at liberty to put an end
to the contract.
(b) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre two nights in every week during the next two months, and
B engages to pay her at the rate of 100 Taka for each night. On the sixth night A wilfully absents herself. With the assent of B, A sings on the seventh
night. B has signified his acquiescence in the continuance of the contract, and cannot now put an end to it, but is entitled to compensation for the
damage sustained by him through A's failure to sing on the sixth night.
By whom Contracts must be performed

Person by whom promise
is to be performed

40. If it appears from the nature of the case that it was the intention of the parties to any contract that any promise contained in it should be
performed by the promisor himself, such promise must be performed by the promisor. In other cases, the promisor or his representatives may
employ a competent person to perform it.Illustrations
(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money. A may perform this promise, either by personally paying the money to B or by causing it to be paid to B by
another; and, if A dies before the time appointed for payment, his representatives must perform the promise, or employ some proper person to do so.
(b) A promises to paint a picture for B. A must perform this promise personally.

Effect of accepting
performance from third
person

41. When a promisee accepts performance of the promise from a third person, he cannot afterwards enforce it against the promisor.

Devolution of joint
liabilities

42. When two or more persons have made a joint promise, then, unless a contrary intention appears by the contract, all such persons during their
joint lives, and after the death of any of them his representative jointly with the survivor or survivors, and after the death of the last survivor, the
representatives of all jointly, must fulfil the promise.

Any one of joint promisors
may be compelled to
perform Each promisor
may compel contribution
Sharing of loss by default
in contribution

43. When two or more persons make a joint promise, the promisee may, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, compel any one or
more of such joint promisors to perform the whole of the promise.
Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every other joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise,
unless a contrary intention appears from the contract.
If any one of two or more joint promisors makes default in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such
default in equal shares.
Explanation – Nothing in this section shall prevent a surety from recovering from his principal, payments made by the surety on behalf of the
principal, or entitle the principal to recover anything from the surety on account of payments made by the principal.
Illustrations
(a) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D 3,000 Taka. D may compel either A or B or C to pay him 3,000 Taka.
(b) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D the sum of 3,000 Taka. C is compelled to pay the whole. A is insolvent, but his assets are sufficient to pay
one-half of his debts. C is entitled to receive 500 Taka from A's estate, and 1,250 Taka from B.
(c) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3,000 Taka. C is unable to pay anything, and A is compelled to pay the whole. A is entitled to
receive 1,500 Taka from B.
(d) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3,000 Taka, A and B being only sureties for C. C fails to pay. A and B are compelled to pay the
whole sum. They are entitled to recover it from C.

Effect of release of one
joint promisor

44. Where two or more persons have made a joint promise, a release of one of such joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other
joint promisor or joint promisors; neither does it free the joint promisors so released from responsibility to the other joint promisor or joint promisors.

Devolution of joint rights

45. When a person has made a promise to two or more persons jointly, then, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, the right to claim
performance rests, as between him and them, with them during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, with the representative of such
deceased person jointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the last survivor, with the representatives of all jointly.
Illustration
A, in consideration of 5,000 Taka lent to him by B and C, promises B and C jointly to repay them that sum with interest on a day specified. B dies.
The right to claim performance rests with B's representative jointly with C during C's life, and after the death of C with the representatives of B and C
jointly.
Time and Place for Performance

Time for performance of
promise where no
application is to be made
and no time is specified

46. Where, by the contract, a promisor is to perform his promise without application by the promisee, and no time for performance is specified, the
engagement must be performed within a reasonable time. Explanation – The question "what is a reasonable time" is, in each particular case, a
question of fact.

Time and place for
performance of promise
where time is specified
and no application to be
made

47. When promise is to be performed on a certain day, and the promisor has undertaken to perform it without application by the promisee, the
promisor may perform it at any time during the usual hours of business on such day and at the place at which the promise ought to be performed.

Application for
performance on certain
day to be at proper time
and place

48. When a promise is to be performed on a certain day, and the promisor has not undertaken to perform it without application by the promisee, it is
the duty of the promisee to apply for performance at a proper place and within the usual hours of business.

Place for performance of
promise were no
application to be made and
no place fixed for
performance

49. When a promise is to be performed without application by the promisee, and no place is fixed for the performance of it, it is the duty of the
promisor to apply to the promisee to appoint a reasonable place for the performance of the promise, and to perform it at such place.

Performance in manner or
at time prescribed or
sanctioned by promisee

50. The performance of any promise may be made in any manner, or at any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions.

Illustration
A promises to deliver goods at B's warehouse on the first January. On that day A brings the goods to B's warehouse, but after the usual hour for
closing it, and they are not received. A has not performed his promise.

Explanation – The question "what is a proper time and place" is, in each particular case, a question of fact.

Illustration
A undertakes to deliver a thousand maunds of jute to B on a fixed day. A must apply to B to appoint a reasonable place for the purpose of receiving
it, and must deliver it to him at such place.

Illustrations
(a) B awes A 2,000 Taka. A desires B to pay the amount to A's account with C, a banker. B, who also banks with C, orders the amount to be
transferred from his account to A's credit, and this is done by C. Afterwards, and before A knows of the transfer, C fails. There has been a good
payment by B.
(b) A and B are mutually indebted. A and B settle an account by setting off one item against another, and B pays A the balance found to be due from
him upon such settlement. This amounts to a payment by A and B, respectively, of the sums which they owed to each other.
(c) A owes B 2,000 Taka. B accepts some of A's goods in reduction of the debt. The delivery of the goods operates as a part payment.
(d) A desires B, who owes him Taka 100, to send him a note for Taka 100 by post. The debt is discharged as soon as B puts into the post a letter
containing the note duly addressed to A.
Performance of Reciprocal Promises

Promisor not bound to
perform, unless reciprocal
promisee ready and willing
to perform

51. When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor need perform his promise unless the promisee is
ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promise.
Illustrations
(a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B to be paid for by B on delivery.
A need not deliver the goods, unless B is ready and willing to pay for the goods on delivery.
B need not pay for the goods, unless A is ready and willing to deliver them on payment.
(b) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B at a price to be paid by installments, the first installment to be paid on delivery.
A need not deliver, unless B is ready and willing to pay the first installment on delivery.
B need not pay the first installment, unless A is ready and willing to deliver the goods on payment of the first installment.

Order of performance of
reciprocal promises

52. Where the order in which reciprocal promises are to be performed is expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order; and,
where the order is not expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order which the nature of the transaction requires.
Illustrations
(a) A and B contract that A shall build a house for B at a fixed price. A's promise to build the house must be performed before B's promise to pay for
it.
(b) A and B contract that A shall make over his stock-in-trade to B at a fixed price, and B promises to give security for the payment of the money. A's
promise need not be performed until the security is given, for the nature of the transaction requires that A should have security before he delivers up
his stock.

Liability of party
preventing event on which
the contract is to take
effect

53. When a contract contains reciprocal promises, and one party to the contract prevents the other from performing his promise, the contract
becomes voidable at the option of the party so prevented; and he is entitled to compensation from the other party for any loss which he may sustain
in consequence of the non-performance of the contract.
Illustration
A and B contract that B shall execute certain work for A for a thousand Taka. B is ready and willing to execute the work accordingly, but A prevents
him from doing so. The contract is voidable at the option of B; and, if he elects to rescind it, he is entitled to recover from A compensation for any loss
which he has incurred by its non-performance.

Effect of default as to that
promise which should be
first performed, in contract
consisting of reciprocal
promises

54. When a contract consists of reciprocal promises, such that one of them cannot be performed, or that its performance cannot be claimed till the
other has been performed, and the promisor of the promise last mentioned fails to perform it, such promisor cannot claim the performance of the
reciprocal promise, and must make compensation to the other party to the contract for any loss which such other party may sustain by the nonperformance of the contract.
Illustrations
(a) A hires B's ship to take in and convey, from Chittagong to the Mauritius, a cargo to be provided by A, B receiving a certain freight for its
conveyance. A does not provide any cargo for the ship. A cannot claim the performance of B's promise, and must make compensation to B for the
loss which B sustains by the non-performance of the contract.
(b) A contracts with B to execute certain builder's work for a fixed price, B supplying the scaffolding and timber necessary for the work. B refuses to
furnish any scaffolding or timber, and the work cannot be executed. A need not execute the work, and B is bound to make compensation to A for any
loss caused to him by the non-performance of the contract.
(c) A contracts with B to deliver to him, at a specified price, certain merchandise on board a ship which cannot arrive for a month, and B engages to
pay for the merchandise within a week from the date of the contract. B does not pay within the week. A's promise to deliver need not be performed,
and B must make compensation.
(d) A promises B to sell him one hundred bales of merchandise, to be delivered next day, and B promises A to pay for them within a month. A does
not deliver according to his promise. B's promise to pay need not be performed, and A must make compensation.

Effect of failure to perform
at fixed time, in contract in
which time is essential

55. When a party to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time, or certain things at or before a specified times, and fails to
do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so much of it as has not been performed, becomes voidable at the option of the
promisee, if the intention of the parties was that time should be of the essence of the contract.

Effect of such failure when
time is not essential

If it was not the intention of the parties that time should be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do
such thing at or before the specified time; but the promisee is entitled to compensation from the promisor for any loss occasioned to him by such
failure.

Effect of acceptance of
performance at time other
than that agreed upon

If, in case of a contract voidable on account of the promisor's failure to perform his promise at the time agreed, the promisee accepts performance of
such promise at any time other than that agreed, the promisee cannot claim compensation for any loss occasioned by the non-performance of the
promise at the time agreed, unless, at the time of such acceptance he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to do so.

Agreement to do
impossible act

56. An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void.

Contract to do act
afterwards becoming
impossible or unlawful

A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promissor could not prevent,
unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.

Compensation for loss

Where one person has promised to do something which he knew, or, with reasonable diligence, might have known, and which the promisee did not

through non-performance
of act known to be
impossible or unlawful

know to be impossible or unlawful, such promisor must make compensation to such promisee for any loss which such promisee sustains through the
non-performance of the promise.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees with B to discover treasure by magic. The agreement is void.
(b) A and B contract to marry each other. Before the time fixed for the marriage, A goes mad. The contract becomes void.
(c) A contracts to marry B, being already married to C, and being forbidden by the law to which he is subject to practise polygamy. A must make
compensation to B for the loss caused to her by the non-performance of his promise.
(d) A contracts to take in cargo for B at a foreign port. A's Government afterwards declares war against the country in which the port is situated. The
contract becomes void when war is declared.
(e) A contracts to act at a theatre for six months in consideration of a sum, paid in advance by B. On several occasions A is too ill to act. The contract
to act on those occasions becomes void.

Reciprocal promise to do
things legal, and also other
things illegal

57. Where persons reciprocally promise, firstly, to do certain things which are legal, and, secondly, under specified circumstances, to do certain other
things which are illegal, the first set of promises is a contract, but the second is a void agreement.
Illustration
A and B agree that A shall sell B a house for 10,000 Taka but that, if B uses it as a gambling house, he shall pay A 50,000 Taka for it.
The first set of reciprocal promises, namely, to sell the house and to pay 10,000 Taka for it, is a contract.
The second set is for an unlawful object, namely, that B may use the house as a gambling house, and is a void agreement.

Alternative promise, one
branch being illegal

58. In the case of an alternative promise, one branch of which is legal and the other illegal, the legal branch alone can be enforced.
Illustration
A and B agree that A shall pay B 1,000 Taka for which B shall afterwards deliver to A either rice or smuggled opium.
This is a valid contract to deliver rice, and a void agreement as to the opium.
Appropriation of Payments

Application of payment,
where debt to be
discharged is indicated

59. Where a debtor, owing several distinct debts to one person, makes a payment to him, either with express intimation, or under circumstances
implying that the payment is to be applied to the discharge of some particular debt, the payment, if accepted, must be applied accordingly.
Illustrations
(a) A owes B, among other debts, 1,000 Taka upon a promissory note which falls due on the first June. He owes B no other debt of that amount. On
the first June A pays to B 1,000 Taka. The payment is to be applied to the discharge of the promissory note.
(b) A owes to B, among other debts the sum of 567 Taka. B writes to A and demands payment of this sum. A sends to B 567 Taka. This payment is to
be applied to the discharge of the debt of which B had demanded payment.

Application of payment,
where debt to be
discharged is not indicated

60. Where the debtor has omitted to intimate and there are no other circumstances indicating to which debt the payment is to be applied, the creditor
may apply it at his discretion to any lawful debt actually due and payable to him from the debtor, whether its recovery is or is not barred by the law in
force for the time being as to the limitation of suits.

Application of payment
where neither party
appropriates

61. Where neither party makes any appropriation the payment shall be applied in discharge of the debts in order of time, whether they are or are not
barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation of suits. If the debts are of equal standing, the payment shall be applied in discharge
of each proportionally.
Contracts Which Need Not be Performed

Effect of novation,
rescission and alteration
of contract

62. If the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract for it, or to rescind or alter it, the original contract need not be performed.
Illustrations
(a) A owes money to B under a contract. It is agreed between A, B and C that B shall thenceforth accept C as his debtor, instead of A. The old debt
of A to B is at an end, and a new debt from C to B has been contracted.
(b) A owes B 10,000 Taka. A enters into an arrangement with B, and gives B a mortgage of his (A's) estate for 5,000 Taka, in place of the debt of
10,000 Taka. This is a new contract and extinguishes the old.
(c) A owes B 1,000 Taka under a contract. B owes C 1,000 Taka. B orders A to credit C with 1,000 Taka in his books, but C does not assent to the
arrangement. B still owes C 1,000 Taka, and no new contract has been entered into.

Promisee may dispense
with or remit performance
of promise

63. Every promisee may dispense with or remit, wholly or in part, the performance of the promise made to him or may extend the time for such
performance, or may accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit.
Illustrations
(a) A promises to paint a picture for B. B afterwards forbids him to do so. A is no longer bound to perform the promise.
(b) A owes B 5,000 Taka. A pays to B, and B accepts, in satisfaction of the whole debt, 2,000 Taka paid at the time and place at which the 5,000 Taka
were payable. The whole debt is discharged.
(c) A owes B 5,000 Taka. C pays to B 1,000 Taka, and B accepts them, in satisfaction of his claim on A. This payment is a discharge of the whole
claim.
(d) A owes B, under a contract, a sum of money, the amount of which has not been ascertained. A, without ascertaining the amount, gives to B, and
B, in satisfaction thereof, accepts, the sum of 2,000 Taka. This is a discharge of the whole debt, whatever may be its amount.
(e) A owes B 2,000 Taka and is also indebted to other creditors. A makes an arrangement with his creditors, including B, to pay them a composition
of eight annas in the Taka upon their respective demands. Payment to be of 1,000 Taka is a discharge of B's demand.

Consequences of
rescission of voidable
contract

64. When a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds it, the other party thereto need not perform any promise therein contained in
which he is promisor. The party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he have received any benefit thereunder from another party to such contract,
restore such benefit, so far as may be, to the person from whom it was received.

Obligation of person who
has received advantage
under void agreement or
contract that becomes
void

65. When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a contact becomes void, any person who has received any advantage under such
agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for it to the person from whom he received it.
Illustrations
(a) A pays B 1,000 Taka in consideration of B's promising to marry C, A's daughter. C is dead at the time of promise. The agreement is void, but B
must repay A the 1,000 Taka.
(b) A contracts with B to deliver to him 250 maunds of rice before the first of May. A delivers 130 maunds only before that day, and none after. B
retains the 130 maunds after the first of May. He is bound to pay A for them.
(c) A, a singer, contracts with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre for two nights in every week during the next two months, and B
engages to pay her a hundred Taka for each night's performance. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents herself from the theatre, and B, in
consequence, rescinds the contract. B must pay A for the five nights on which she had sung.
(d) A contracts to sing for B at a concert for 1,000 Taka which are paid in advance. A is too ill to sing. A is not bound to make compensation to B for
the loss of the profits which B would have made if A had been able to sing, but must refund to B the 1,000 Taka paid in advance.

Mode of communicating or
revoking rescission of
voidable contract

66. The rescission of a voidable contract may be communicated or revoked in the same manner, and subject to the same rules, as apply to the
communication or revocation of a proposal.

Effect of neglect of
promisee to afford
promisor reasonable
facilities for performance

67. If any promisee neglects or refuses to afford the promisor reasonable facilities for the performance of his promise, the promisor is excused by
such neglect or refusal as to any non-performance caused thereby.
Illustration
A contracts with B to repair B's house.
B neglects or refuses to point out to A the places in which his house requires repair.
A is excused for the non-performance of the contract if it is caused by such neglect or refusal.

OF CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT
Claim for necessaries
supplied to person
incapable of contracting or
on his account

68. If a person, incapable of entering into a contract, or any one whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person with necessaries
suited to his condition in life, the person who has furnished such supplies is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable person.
Illustrations
(a) A supplies B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to his condition in life. A is entitled to be reimbursed from B's property.
(b) A supplies the wife and children of B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to their condition in life. A is entitled to be reimbursed from B's property.

Reimbursement of person
paying money due by
another in payment of
which he is interested

69. A person who is interested in the payment of money which another is bound by law to pay, and who therefore pays it, is entitled to be reimbursed
by the other.
Illustration
B holds land in Bangladesh, on a lease granted by A, the zamindar. The revenue payable by A to the Government being in arrear, his lands is
advertised for sale by the Government. Under the
revenue law, the consequence of such sale will be the annulment of B's lease. B, to prevent the sale and the consequent annulment of his own
lease, pays to the Government the sum due from A. A is bound to make good to B the amount so paid.

Obligation of person
enjoying benefit of nongratuitous act

70. Where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or delivers anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitously, and such other person
enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.
Illustrations
(a) A, a tradesman, leaves goods at B's house by mistake. B treats the goods as his own. He is bound to pay A for them.
(b) A saves B's property from fire. A is not entitled to compensation from B, if the circumstances show that he intended to act gratuitously.

Responsibility of finder of
goods

71. A person who finds goods belonging to another and takes them into his custody, is subject to the same responsibility as a bailee.

Liability of person to whom
money is paid or thing
delivered by mistake or
under coercion

72. A person to whom money has been paid or any thing delivered by mistake or under coercion, must repay or return it.
Illustrations
(a) A and B jointly owe 100 Taka to C. A alone pays the amount to C, and B, not knowing this fact, pays 100 Taka over again to C. C is bound to
repay the amount to B.
(b) A railway company refuses to deliver up certain goods to the consignee, except upon the payment of an illegal charge for carriage. The
consignee pays the sum charged in order to obtain the goods. He is entitled to recover so much of the charge as was illegally excessive.

OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT
Compensation for loss or
damage caused by breach
of contract

73. When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract,
compensation for any loss or damagecaused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the
parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it.
Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach.

Compensation for failure
to discharge obligation
resembling those created
by contract

When an obligation resembling those created by contract has been incurred and has not been discharged, any person injured by the failure to
discharge it is entitled to receive the same compensation from the party in default, as if such person had contracted to discharge it and had broken
his contract.
Explanation – In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused
by the non-performance of the contract must be taken into account.
Illustrations
(a) A contracts to sell and deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B, at a certain price to be paid on delivery. A breaks his promise. B is entitled to receive
from A, by way of compensation, the sum, if any, by which the contract price falls short of the price for which B might have obtained 50 maunds of
saltpetre of like quality at the time when the saltpetre ought to have been delivered.
(b) A hires B's ship to go to 7[Chalna], and there take on board, on the first of January, a cargo which A is to provide and to bring it to Chittagong, the
freight to be paid when earned. B's ship does not go to 8[Chalna], but A has opportunities of procuring suitable conveyance for the cargo upon terms
as advantageous as those on which he had chartered the ship. A avails himself of those opportunities, but is put to trouble and expense in doing so.
A is entitled to receive compensation from B in respect of such trouble and expense.
(c) A contracts to buy of B, at a stated price, 50 maunds of rice, no time being fixed for delivery. A afterwards informs B that he will not accept the rice
if tendered to him. B is entitled to receive from A, by way
of compensation, the amount, if any, by which the contract price exceeds that which B can obtain for the rice at the time when A informs B that he will
not accept it.
(d) A contracts to buy B's ship for 60,000 Taka, but breaks his promise. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the excess, if any, of the contract
price over the price which B can obtain for the ship at the time of the breach of the promise.
(e) A, the owner of a boat, contracts with B to take a cargo of jute to Mymensingh, for sale at that place, starting on a specified day. The boat owing
to some avoidable cause, does not start at the time appointed, where by the arrival of the cargo at Mymensingh is delayed beyond the time when it
would have arrived if the boat had sailed according to the contract. After that date, and before the arrival of the cargo, the price of jute falls. The
measure of the compensation payable to B by A is the difference between the price which B could have obtained for the cargo at Mymensingh at the
time when it would have arrived if forwarded in due course, and its market price at the time when it actually arrived.
(f) A contracts to repair B's house in a certain manner, and receives payment in advance. A repairs the house, but not according to contract. B is
entitled to recover from A the cost of making the repairs conform to the contract.
(g) A contracts to let his ship to B for a year, from the first of January, for a certain price. Freights rise, and, on the first of January, the hire obtainable
for the ship is higher than the contract price. A breaks his promise. He must pay to B, by way of compensation, a sum equal to the difference
between the contract price and the price for which B could hire a similar ship for a year on and from the first of January.
(h) A contracts to supply B with a certain quantity of iron at a fixed price, being a higher price than that for which A could procure and deliver the iron.
B wrongfully refuses to receive the iron. B must pay to A, by way of compensation, the difference between the contract price of the iron and the sum
for which A could have obtained and delivered it.
(i) A delivers to B, a common carrier, a machine, to be conveyed, without delay, to A's mill informing B that his mill is stopped for want of the machine.
B unreasonably delays the delivery of the machine, and A, in consequence, losses a profitable contract with the Government. A is entitled to receive
from B, by way of compensation, the average amount of profit which would have been made by the working of the mill during the time that delivery of
it was delayed, but not the loss sustained through the loss of the Government contract.
(j) A, having contracted with B to supply B with 1,000 tons of iron at 100 Taka a ton, to be delivered at a stated time, contracts with C for the
purchase of 1,000 tons of iron at 80 Taka a ton, telling C that he does so for the purpose of performing his contract with B. C fails to perform his
contract with A, who cannot procure other iron, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract. C must pay to A 20,000 Taka, being the profit which A
would have made by the performance of his contract with B.
(k) A contracts with B to make and deliver to B, by a fixed day, for a specified price, a certain piece of machinery. A does not deliver the piece of
machinery at the time specified, and, in consequence of this, B is obliged to procure another at a higher price than that which he was to have paid to
A, and is prevented from performing a contract which B had made with a third person at the time of his contract with A (but which had not been then
communicated to A), and is compelled to make compensation for breach of that contract. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the difference
between the contract price of the piece of machinery and the sum paid by B for another, but not the sum paid by B to the third person by way of
compensation.
(l) A, a builder, contracts to erect and finish a house by the first of January, in order that B may give possession of it at that time to C, to whom B has
contracted to let it. A is informed of the contract between B and C. A builds the house so badly that, before the first of January, if falls down and has
to be rebuilt by B, who, in consequence, losses the rent which he was to have received from C, and is obliged to make compensation to C for the
breach of his contract. A must make compensation to B for the cost of rebuilding the house, for the rent lost, and for the compensation made to C.
(m) A sells certain merchandise to B, warranting it to be of a particular quality, and B, in reliance upon this warranty, sells it to C with a similar
warranty. The goods prove to be not according to the warranty, and B becomes liable to pay C a sum of money by way of compensation. B is entitled
to be reimbursed this sum by A.
(n) A contracts to pay a sum of money to B on a day specified. A does not pay the money on that day; B, in consequence of not receiving the money
on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined. A is not liable to make good to B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pay,
together with interest up to the day of payment.
(o) A contracts to deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B on the first of January, at a certain price. B afterwards, before the first of January, contracts to
sell the saltpetre to C at a price higher than the market price of the first of January. A breaks his promise. In estimating the compensation payable by
A to B, the market price of the first of January, and not the profit which would have arisen to B from the sale to C, is to be taken into account.
(p) A contracts to sell and deliver 500 bales of cotton to B on a fixed day, A Knows nothing of B's mode of conducting his business. A breaks his
promise, and B, having no cotton, is obliged to close his mill. A is not responsible to B for the loss caused to B by the closing of the mill.
(q) A contracts to sell and deliver to B, on the first of January, certain cloth which B intends to manufacture into caps of a particular kind, for which
there is no demand, except at that season. The cloth is not delivered till after the appointed time, and too late to be used that year in making caps. B
is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the difference between the contract price of the cloth and its market price at the time of
delivery, but not the profits which he expected to obtain by making caps, nor the expenses which he has been put to in marking preparation for the
manufacture.
(r) A, a ship-owner, contracts with B to convey him from Chittagong to Sydney in A's ship, sailing on the first of January, and B pays to A, by way of
deposit, one-half of his passage-money. The ship does not sail on the first of January, and B, after being, in consequence, detained in Chittagong for
some time, and thereby put to some expense, proceeds to Sydney in another vessel, and, in consequence, arriving too late in Sydney, loses a sum
of money. A is liable to repay to B his deposit, with interest, and the expense to which he is put by his detention in Chittagong, and the excess, if any,
of the passage-money paid for the second ship over that agreed upon for the first, but not the sum of money which B lost by arriving in Sydney too
late.

Compensation for breach
of contract where penalty
stipulated for

74. When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains
any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been
caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the
case may be, the penalty stipulated for.
Explanation – A stipulation for increased interest from the date of default may be stipulation by way of penalty.
Exception.–When any person enters into any bail-bond, recognizance or other instrument of the same nature, or, under the provisions of any law, or
under the orders of the 9[Government], gives any bond for the performance of any public duty or act in which the public are interested, he shall be
liable, upon breach of the condition of any such instrument, to pay the whole sum mentioned therein.
Explanation -A person who enters into a contract with Government does not necessarily thereby undertake any public duty, or promise to do an act in
which the public are interested.
Illustrations
(a) A contracts with B to pay B Taka 1,000, if he fails to pay B Taka 500 on a given day. A fails pay B Taka 500 on that day. B is entitled to recover
from A such compensation, not exceeding Taka 1,000, as the Court considers reasonable.
(b) A contracts with B that, if A practices as a surgeon within Chittagong, he will pay B Taka 5,000. A practices as a surgeon in Chittagong. B is
entitled to such compensation, not exceeding Taka 5,000, as the Court considers reasonable.

interest shall be payable at the rate of 75 per cent. from the date of default. This is a stipulation by way of penalty, and B is only entitled to recover
from A such compensation as the Court considers reasonable.
(e) A, who owes money to B, a money-lender, undertakes to repay him by delivering to him 10 maunds of grain on a certain date, and stipulates that,
in the event of his not delivering the stipulated amount by the stipulated date, he shall be liable to deliver 20 maunds. This is a stipulation by way of
penalty, and B is only entitled to reasonable compensation in case of breach.
(f) A undertakes to repay B a loan of Taka 1,000 by five equal monthly instalments with a stipulation that, in default of payment of any installment, the
whole shall become due. This stipulation is not by way of penalty, and the contract may be enforced according to its terms.
(g) A borrows Taka 100 from B and gives him a bond for Taka 200 payable by five yearly instalments of Taka 40, with a stipulation that, in default of
payment of any installment, the whole shall become due. This is a stipulation by way of penalty.

Party rightfully rescinding
contract entitled to
compensation

75. A person who rightly rescinds a contract is entitled to compensation for any damage which he has sustained through the non-fulfilment of the
contract.
Illustration
A, a singer, contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre for two nights in every week during the next two months, and B engages
to pay her 100 Taka for each night's performance. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents herself from the theatre, and B, in consequence, rescinds the
contract. B is entitled to claim compensation for the damage which he has sustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract.

OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE
"Contract of indemnity"
defined

124. A contract by which one party promises to save the other from loss caused to him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of
any other person, is called a "contract of indemnity".
Illustration
A contracts to indemnify B against the consequences of any proceedings which C may take against B in respect of a certain sum of 200 Taka. This is
a contract of indemnity.

Rights of indemnity- holder
when sued

125. The promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting within the scope of his authority, is entitled to recover from the promisor(1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which the promise to indemnify applies;
(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if, in bringing or defending it, he did not contravene the orders of the promisor, and
acted as it would have been prudent for him to act in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorized him to bring or defend
the suit;
(3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such suit, if the compromise was not contrary to the orders of the
promisor, and was one which it would have been prudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor
authorized him to compromise the suit.

"Contract of guarantee",
"surety", "principal
debtor" and "creditor"

126. A "contract of guarantee" is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his default. The person who
gives the guarantee is called the "surety": the person in respect of whose default the guarantee is given is called the "principal debtor", and the
person to whom the guarantee is given is called the "creditor". A guarantee may be either oral or written.

Consideration for
guarantee

127. Anything done, or any promise made, for the benefit of the principal debtor may be a sufficient consideration to the surety for giving the
guarantee.
Illustrations
(a) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee the payment of the price of the goods. C
promises to guarantee the payment in consideration of A's promise to deliver the goods. This is a sufficient consideration for C's promise.
(b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, and promises that if he does so, C will pay for
them in defaults of payment by B. A agrees to forbear as requested. This is a sufficient consideration for C's promise.
(c) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for them in default of B. The agreement is void.

Surety's liability

128. The liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract.
Illustration
A guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishonoured by C. A is liable not only for the amount of the bill but
also for any interest and charges which may have become due on it.

"Continuing guarantee"

129. A guarantee which extends to a series of transactions is called a "continuing guarantee".
Illustrations
(a) A, in consideration that B will employ C in collecting the rent of B's zamindari, promises B to be responsible, to the amount of 5,000 Taka, for the
due collection and payment by C of those rents. This is a continuing guarantee.
(b) A guarantees payment to B, a tea-dealer, to the amount of ┬ú 100, for any tea he may from time to time supply to C. B supplies C with tea to
above the value of ┬ú 100, and C pay B for it. Afterwards B supplies C with tea to the value of ┬ú 200. C fails to pay. The guarantee given by A was
a continuing guarantee, and he is accordingly liable to B to the extent of ┬ú 100.
(c) A guarantees payment to B of the price of five sacks of flour to be delivered by B to C and to be paid for in a month. B delivers five sacks to C. C
pays for them. Afterwards B delivers four sacks to C, which C does not pay for. The guarantee given by A was not a continuing guarantee, and
accordingly he is not liable for the price of the four sacks.

Revocation of continuing
guarantee

130. A continuing guarantee may at any time be revoked by the surety, as to future transactions, by notice to the creditor.
Illustrations
(a) A, in consideration of B's discounting, at A's request, bills of exchange for C, guarantees to B, for twelve months, the due payment of all such bills
to the extent of 5,000 Taka. B discounts bills for C to the extent of 2,000 Taka. Afterwards, at the end of three months, A revokes the guarantee. This
revocation discharges A from all liability to B for any subsequent discount. But A is liable to B for the 2,000 Taka, on default of C.
(b) A guarantees to B, to the extent of 10,000 Taka, that C shall pay all the bills that B shall draw upon him. B draws upon C. C accepts the bill. A
gives notice of revocation. C dishonours the bill at maturity. A is liable upon his guarantee.

Revocation of continuing
guarantee by surety's
death

131. The death of the surety operates, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regards
future transactions.

Liability of two persons
primarily liable, not
affected by arrangement
between them that one
shall be surety on other’s
default

132. Where two persons contract with a third person to undertake a certain liability, and also contract with each other that one of them shall be liable
only on the default of the other, the third person not being a party to such contract, the liability of each of such two persons to the third person under
the first contract is not affected by the existence of the second contract, although such third person may have been aware of its existence.

Discharge of surety by
variance in terms of
contract

133. Any variance, made without the surety's consents, in the terms of the contract between the principal debtor and the creditor, discharges the
surety as to transactions subsequent to the variance.

Illustration
A and B make a joint and several promissory note to C. A makes it, in fact, as surety for B, and C knows this at the time when the note is made. The
fact that A, to the knowledge of C, made the note as surety for B, is no answers to a suit by C against A upon the note.

Illustrations
(a) A becomes surety to C for B's conduct as a manager in C's bank. Afterwards, B and C contract, without A's consent, that B's salary shall be
raised, and that he shall become liable for one-fourth of the losses on overdrafts. B allows a customer to overdraw, and the bank loses a sum of
money. A is discharged from his suretyship by the variance made without his consent, and is not liable to make good this loss.
(b) A guarantees C against the misconduct of B in an office to which B is appointed by C, and of which the duties are defined by an Act of the
Legislature. By a subsequent Act, the nature of the office is materially altered. Afterwards, B misconducts himself. A is discharged by the change
from future liability under his guarantee, though the misconduct of B is in respect of a duty not affected by the later Act.
(c) C agrees to appoint B as his clerk to sell goods at a yearly salary, upon A's becoming surety to C for B's duly accounting for moneys received by
him as such clerk. Afterwards, without A's knowledge or consent, C and B agree that B should be paid by a commission on the goods sold by him
and not by a fixed salary. A is not liable for subsequent misconduct of B.
(d) A gives to C a continuing guarantee to the extent of 3,000 Taka for any oil supplied by C to B on credit. Afterwards B becomes embarrassed, and
, without the knowledge of A, B and C contract that C shall continue to supply B with oil for ready money, and that the payments shall be applied to
the then existing debts between B and C. A is not liable on his guarantee for any goods supplied after this new arrangement.
(e) C contracts to lend B 5,000 Taka on the 1st March. A guarantees repayment. C pays the 5,000 Taka to B on the 1st January. A is discharged from
his liability, as the contract has been varied inasmuch as C might sue B for the money before the 1st of March.

Discharge of surety by
release or discharge of
principal debtor

134. The surety is discharged by any contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the principal debtor is released, or by any act
or omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of which is the discharge of the principal debtor.
Illustrations
(a) A gives a guarantee to C for goods to be supplied by C to B. C supplies goods to B, and afterwards B becomes embarrassed and contracts with
his creditors (including C) to assign to them his property in consideration of their releasing him from their demands. Here B is released from his debt
by the contract with C, and A is discharged from his suretyship.
(b) A contracts with B to grow a crop of indigo on A's land and to deliver it to B at a fixed rate, and C guarantees A's performance of this contracts. B
diverts a stream of water which is necessary for irrigation of A's land and thereby prevents him from raising the indigo. C is no longer liable on his
guarantee.
(c) A contracts with B for a fixed price to build a house for B within a stipulated time, B supplying the necessary timber. C guarantees A's
performance of the contract. B omits to supply the timber. C is discharged from his suretyship.

Discharge of surety when
creditor compounds with,
gives time to, or agrees
not to sue, principal debtor

135. A contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the creditor makes a composition with, or promises to give time to, or not to
sue, the principal debtor discharges the surety, unless the surety assents to such contract.

Surety not discharged
when agreement made
with third person to give
time to principal debtor

136. Where a contract to give time to the principal debtor is made by the creditor with a third person, and not with the principal debtor, the surety is
not discharged.

Creditor's forbearance to
sue does not discharge
surety

137. Mere forbearance on the part of the creditor to sue the principal debtor or to enforce any other remedy against him does not, in the absence of
any provision in the guarantee to the contrary, discharge the surety.

Illustration
C, the holder of an overdue bill of exchange drawn by A as surety for B, and accepted by B, contracts with M to give time to B. A is not discharged.

Illustration
B owes to C a debt guaranteed by A. The debt becomes payable. C does not sue B for year after the debt has become payable. A is not discharged
from his suretyship.

Release of one co-surety
does not discharge others

138. Where there are co-sureties, a release by the creditor of one of them does not discharge the others; neither does it free the surety so released
from his responsibility to the other sureties.

Discharge of surety by
creditor's act or omission
impairing surety's eventual
remedy

139. If the creditor does any act which is inconsistent with the rights of the surety, or omits to do any act which his duty to the surety requires him to
do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the principal debtor is thereby impaired, the surety is discharged.
Illustrations
(a) B contracts to build a ship for C for a given sum, to be paid by instalments as the work reaches certain stages. A becomes surety to C for B's due
performance of the contract. C, without the knowledge of A, prepays to B the last two instalments. A is discharged by this prepayment.
(b) C lends money to B on the security of a joint and several promissory note made in C's favour by B, and by A as surety for B, together with a bill of
sale of B's furniture, which gives power to C to sell the furniture, and apply the proceeds in discharge of the note. Subsequently, C sells the furniture,
but, owing to his misconduct and wilful negligence, only a small price is realized. A is discharged from liability on the note.
(c) A puts M as apprentice to B, and gives a guarantee to B for M's fidelity. B promises on his part that he will, at least once a month, see M make up
the cash. B omits to see this done as promised, and M embezzles. A is not liable to B on his guarantee.

Rights of surety on
payment or performance

140. Where a guaranteed debt has become due, or default of the principal debtor to perform a guaranteed duty has taken place, the surety, upon
payment or performance of all that he is liable for, is invested with all the rights which the creditor had against the principal debtor.

Surety's right to benefit of
creditor's securities

141. A surety is entitled to the benefit of every security which the creditor has against the principal debtor at the time when the contract of suretyship
is entered into, whether the surety knows of the existence of such security or not; and, if the creditor loses, or, without the consent of the surety, parts
with such security, the surety is discharged to the extent of the value of the security.
Illustrations
(a) C advances to B, his tenant, 2,000 Taka on the guarantee of A.C has also, a further security for the 2,000 Taka by a mortgage of B's furniture. C
cancels the mortgage. B becomes insolvent, and C sues A on his guarantee. A is discharged from liability to the amount of the value of the furniture.
(b) C, a creditor, whose advance to B is secured by a decree, receives also a guarantee for that advance from A. C afterwards takes B's goods in
execution under the decree, and then, without the knowledge of A, withdraws the execution. A is discharged.
(c) A, as surety for B, makes a bond jointly with B to C, to secure a loan from C to B. Afterwards, C obtains from B a further security for the same
debt. Subsequently, C gives up the further security. A is not discharged.

Guarantee obtained by
misrepresentation invalid

142. Any guarantee which has been obtained by means of misrepresentation made by the creditor, or with his knowledge and assent, concerning a
material part of the transaction, is invalid.

Guarantee obtained by
concealment invalid

143. Any guarantee which the creditor has obtained by means of keeping silence as to material circumstances is invalid.
Illustrations
(a) A engages B as clerk to collect money for him. B fails to account for some of his receipts, and A in consequence calls upon him to furnish security
his duly accounting. C gives his guarantee for B's duly accounting. A does not acquaint C with B's previous conduct. B afterwards makes default. The
guarantee is invalid.
(b) A guarantees to C payment for iron to be supplied by him to B to the amount of 2,000 tons. B and C have privately agreed that B should pay five
Taka per ton beyond the market price, such excess to be applied in liquidation of an old debt. This agreement is concealed from A. A is not liable as
a surety.

Guarantee on contract that
creditor shall not act on it
until co-surety joins

144. Where a person gives a guarantee upon a contract that the creditor shall not act upon it until another person has joined in it as co-surety, the
guarantee is not valid if that other person does not join.

Implied promise to
indemnify surety

145. In every contract of guarantee there is an implied promise by the principal debtor to indemnify the surety; and the surety is entitled to recover
from the principal debtor whatever sum he has rightfully paid under the guarantee, but no sums which he has paid wrongfully.
Illustrations
(a) B is indebted to C, and A is surety for the debt. C demands payment from A, and on his refusal sues him for the amount. A defends the suit,
having reasonable grounds for doing so, but is compelled to pay the amount of the debt with costs. He can recover from B the amount paid by him
for costs, as well as the principal debt.
(b) C lends B a sum of money, and A, at the request of B, accepts a bill of exchange drawn by B upon A to secure the amount. C, the holder of the
bill, demands payment of it from A, and, on A's refusal to pay, sues him upon the bill. A, not having reasonable grounds for so doing, defends the
suit, and has to pay the amount of the bill and costs. He can recover from B the amount of the bill, but not the sum paid for costs, as there was no
real ground for defending the action.
(c) A guarantees to C, to the extent of 2,000 Taka, payment for rice to be supplied by C to B. C supplies to B rice to a less amount than 2,000 Taka,
but obtains from A payment of the sum of 2,000 Taka in respect of the rice supplied. A cannot recover from B more than the price of the rice actually
supplied.

Co-sureties liable to
contribute equally

146. Where two or more persons are co-sureties for the same debt or duty, either jointly or severally, and whether under the same or different
contracts, and whether with or without the knowledge of each other, the co-sureties, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, are liable, as
between themselves, to pay each an equal share of the whole debt, or of that part of it which remains unpaid by the principal debtor.
Illustrations

to pay 250 Taka, B 250 Taka and C 500 Taka.

Liability of co-sureties

147. Co-sureties who are bound in different sums are liable to pay equally as far as the limits of their respective obligations permit.
Illustrations
(a) A, B and C, as sureties for D, enter into three several bonds, each in a different penalty, namely, A in the penalty of 10,000 Taka, B in that of
20,000 Taka, C in that of 40,000 Taka, conditioned for D's duly accounting to E. D makes default to the extent of 30,000 Taka. A, B and C are each

OF BAILMENT
"Bailment", "bailor", and
"bailee" defined

148. A "bailment" is the delivery of goods by one person to another for some purpose, upon a contract that they shall, when the purpose is
accomplished, be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the person delivering them. The person delivering the goods is
called the "bailor". The person to whom they are delivered is called the "bailee".
Explanation – If a person already in possession of the goods of another contracts to hold them as a bailee, he thereby becomes the bailee, and the
owner becomes the bailor, of such goods although they may not have been delivered by way of bailment.

Delivery to bailee how
made

149. The delivery to the bailee may be made by doing anything which has the effect of putting the goods in the possession of the intended bailee or
of any person authorized to hold them on his behalf.

Bailor’s duty to disclose
faults in goods bailed

from such faults.
If the goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for such damage, whether he was or was not aware of the existence of such faults in the

Bailee when not liable for
loss, etc., of thing bailed

152. The bailee, in the absence of any special contract, is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the thing bailed, if he has taken

bailee's act inconsistent
with conditions

different mark. A is entitled to have his 100 bales returned, and B is bound to bear all the expense incurred in the separation of the bales, and any
other incidental damage.

Effect of mixture, without
bailor's consent, when the
goods cannot be
separated

157. If the bailee, without the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his own goods, in such a manner that it is impossible to
separate the goods bailed from the other goods and deliver them back, the bailor is entitled to be compensated by the bailee for the loss of the
goods.

bailment.

Restoration of goods lent
gratuitously

159. The lender of a thing for use may at any time require its return, if the loan was gratuitous, even though he lent it for a specified time or purpose.

the time agreed upon would cause him loss exceeding the benefit actually derived by him from the loan, the lender must, if he compels the return,
indemnify the borrower for the amount in which the loss so occasioned exceeds the benefit so derived.

accomplishment of
purpose

consent of all, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary.

Bailee not responsible on
re-delivery to bailor
without title

166. If the bailor has no title to the goods, and the bailee, in good faith, delivers them back to, or according to the directions of, the bailor, the bailee

and to find out the owner; but he may retain the goods against the owner until he receives such compensation; and, where the owner has offered a
specific reward for the return of goods lost, the finder may sue for such reward, and may retain the goods until he receives it.

When finder of thing
commonly on sale may sell
it

169. When a thing which is commonly the subject of sale is lost, if the owner cannot with reasonable diligence be found, or if he refuses, upon

(2) when the lawful charges of the finder, in respect of the thing found, amount to two-thirds of its value.

Bailee's particular lien

170. Where the bailee has, in accordance with the purpose of the bailment, rendered any service involving the exercise of labour or skill in respect of
the goods bailed, he has, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, a right to retain such goods until he receives due remuneration for the services
he has rendered in respect of them.

pledged, the pawnee may bring a suit against the pawnor upon the debt or promise, and retain the goods pledged as a collateral security; or he may
sell the thing pledged, on giving the pawnor reasonable notice of the sale.
If the proceeds of such sale are less than the amount due in respect of the debt or promise, the pawnor is still liable to pay the balance. If the
proceeds of the sale are greater than the amount so due, the pawnee shall pay over the surplus to the pawnor.

payment of the debt or performance of the promise at the stipulated time, he may redeem the goods pledged at any subsequent time before the
actual sale of them; but he must, in that case, pay, in addition, any expenses which have arisen from his default.

Pledge by mercantile agent

14

[178. Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods or the documents of title to goods, any pledge made by
him, when acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent, shall be as valid as if he were expressly authorized by the owner of the
goods to make the same; provided that the pawnee acts in good faith and has not at the time of the pledge notice that the pawnor has not authority
to pledge.

such person

195. In selecting such agent for his principal, an agent is bound to exercise the same amount of discretion as a man of ordinary prudence would
exercise in his own case; and, if he does this, he is not responsible to the principal for the acts or negligence of the agent so selected.

211. An agent is bound to conduct the business of his principal according to the directions given by the principal, or, in the absence of any such
directions, according to the custom which prevails in doing business of the same kind at the place where the agent conducts such business. When
the agent acts otherwise, if any loss be sustained, he must make it good to his principal, and, if any profit accrues, he must account for it.
Illustrations
(a) A, an agent engaged in carrying on for B a business, in which it is the custom to invest from time to time, at interest, the moneys which may be in
hand, omits to make such investment. A must make good to B the interest usually obtained by such investments.

before payment, becomes insolvent. B must make good the loss to A.

Skill and diligence
required from agent

212. An agent is bound to conduct the business of the agency with as much skill as is generally possessed by persons engaged in similar business,
unless the principal has notice of his want of skill. The agent is always bound to act with reasonable diligence, and to use such skill as he possesses;
and to make compensation to his principal in respect of the direct consequences of his own neglect, want of skill or misconduct, but not in respect of
loss or damage which are indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect, want of skill or misconduct.
Illustrations
(a) A, a merchant in Chittagong has an agent, B, in London to whom a sum of money is paid on A's account, with orders to remit. B retains the
money for a considerable time. A, in consequence of not receiving the money, becomes insolvent. B is liable for the money and interest from the day
on which it ought to have been paid, according to the usual rate, and for any further direct loss as e.g., by variation of rate of exchange but not
further.
(b) A, an agent for the sale of goods, having authority to sell on credit, sells to B on credit, without making the proper and usual enquiries as to the
solvency of B. B, at the time of such sale, is insolvent. A must make compensation to his principal in respect of any loss thereby sustained.
(c) A, an insurance-broker employed by B to effect an insurance on a ship, omits to see that the usual clauses are inserted in the policy. The ship is
afterwards lost. In consequence of the omission of the clauses nothing can be recovered from the underwriters. A is bound to make good the loss to
B.
(d) A, a merchant in England, directs B, his agent at 17[Chittagong], who accepts the agency, to send him 100 bales of cotton by a certain ship. B,
having it in his power to send the cotton, omits to do so. The ship arrives safely in England. Soon after her arrival the price of cotton rises. B is bound
to make good to A the profit which he might have made by the 100 bales of cotton at the time the ship arrived, but not any profit he might have made
by the subsequent rise.

instructions.

Right of principal when
agent deals, on his own
account, in business of
agency without principal's
consent

215. If an agent deals on his own account in the business of the agency, without first obtaining the consent of his principal and acquainting him with
all material circumstances which have come to his own knowledge on the subject, the principal may repudiate the transaction, if the case shows
either that any material fact has been dishonestly concealed from him by the agent, or that the dealings of the agent have been disadvantageous to
him.
Illustrations
(a) A directs B to sell A's estate. B buys the estate for himself in the name of C. A, on discovering that B has bought the estate for himself, may
repudiate the sale, if he can show that B has dishonestly concealed any material fact, or that the sale has been disadvantageous to him.
(b) A directs B to sell A's estate. B, on looking over the estate before selling it, finds a mine on the estate which is unknown to A. B informs A that he
wishes to buy the estate for himself, but conceals the discovery of the mine. A allows B to buy in ignorance of the existence of the mine. A, on
discovering that B knew of the mine at the time he bought the estate, may either repudiate or adopt the sale at his option.

Principal's right to benefit
gained by agent dealing on
his own account in
business of agency

216. If an agent, without the knowledge of his principal, deals in the business of the agency on his own account instead of on account of his principal,
the principal is entitled to claim from the agent any benefit which may have resulted to him from the transaction.

Agent's right of retainer
out of sums received on
principal's account

217. An agent may retain, out of any sums received on account of the principal in the business of the agency, all moneys due to himself in respect of
advances made or expenses properly incurred by him in conducting such business, and also such remuneration as may be payable to him for acting
as agent.

Agent's duty to pay sums
received for principal

218. Subject to such deductions, the agent is bound to pay to his principal all sums received on his account.

When agent's
remuneration becomes
due

219. In the absence of any special contract, payment for the performance of any act is not due to the agent until the completion of such act; but an
agent may detain moneys received by him on account of goods sold, although the whole of the goods consigned to him for sale may not have been
sold, or although the sale may not be actually complete.

Agent not entitled to
remuneration for business
mis-conducted

220. An agent who is guilty of misconduct in the business of the agency is not entitled to any remuneration in respect of that part of the business
which he has misconducted.

Illustration
A directs B, his agent, to buy a certain house for him. B tells A it cannot be bought, and buys the house for himself. A may, on discovering that B has
bought the house, compel him to sell it to A at the price he gave for it.

Illustrations
(a) A employs B to recover 1,00,000 Taka from C, and to lay it out on good security. B recovers the 1,00,000 Taka and lays out 90,000 Taka on good
security, but lays out 10,000 Taka on security which he ought to have known to be bad, whereby A loses 2,000 Taka. B is entitled to remuneration for
recovering the 1,00,000 Taka and for investing the 90,000 Taka. He is not entitled to any remuneration for investing the 10,000 Taka, and he must
make good the 2,000 Taka to B.
(b) A employs B to recover 1,000 Taka from C. Through B's misconduct the money is not recovered. B is entitled to no remuneration for his services,
and must make good the loss.

Agent's lien on principal's
property

221. In the absence of any contract to the contrary, an agent is entitled to retain goods, papers and other property, whether moveable or immoveable,
of the principal received by him, until the amount due to himself for commission, disbursements and services in respect of the same has been paid or
accounted for to him.
Principal’s Duty to Agent

Agent to be indemnified
against consequences of
lawful acts

222. The employer of an agent is bound to indemnify him against the consequences of all lawful acts done by such agent in exercise of the authority
conferred upon him.
Illustrations
(a) B, at Singapur, under instructions from A of Chittagong, contracts with C to deliver certain goods to him. A does not send the goods to B, and C
sues B for breach of contract. B informs A of the suit, and A authorizes him to defend the suit. B defends the suit, and is compelled to pay damages
and costs, and incurs expenses. A is liable to B for such damages, costs and expenses.
(b) B, a broker at Chittagong, by the orders of A, a merchant there contracts with C for the purchases of 10 casks of oil for A. Afterwards A refuses to
receive the oil, and C sues B. B informs A, who repudiates the contract altogether. B defends, but unsuccessfully, and has to pay damages and costs
and incurs expenses. A is liable to B for such damages, costs and expenses.

Agent to be indemnified
against consequences of
acts done in good faith

223. Where one person employs another to do an act, and the agent does the act in good faith, the employer is liable to indemnify the agent against
the consequences of that act, though it cause an injury to the rights of third persons.
Illustrations
(a) A, a decree-holder and entitled to execution of B's goods, requires the officer of the Court to seize certain goods, representing them to be the
goods of B. The officer seizes the goods, and is sued by C, the true owner of the goods. A is liable to indemnify the officer for the sum which he is
compelled to pay to C, in consequence of obeying A's directions.
(b) B, at the request of A, sells goods in the possession of A, but which A had no right to dispose of. B does not know this, and hands over the
proceeds of the sale to A. Afterwards C, the true owner of the goods, sues B and recovers the value of the goods and costs. A is liable to indemnify B
for what he has been compelled to pay to C and for B's own expenses.

Non-liability of employer of
agent to do a criminal act

224. Where one person employs another to do an act which is criminal, the employer is not liable to the agent, either upon an express or an implied
promise, to indemnify him against the consequences of that Act.
Illustrations
(a) A employs B to beat C, and agrees to indemnify him against all consequences of act. B thereupon beats C, and has to pay damages to C for so
doing. A is not liable to indemnify B for those damages.
(b) B, the proprietor of a newspaper, publishes, at A's request, liable upon C in the paper, and A agrees to indemnify B against the consequences of
the publication, and all costs and damages of any action in respect thereof. B is sued by C and has to pay damages, and also incurs expenses. A is
not liable to B upon the indemnity.

Compensation to agent for
injury caused by
principal's neglect

225. The principal must make compensation to his agent in respect of injury caused to such agent by the principal's neglect or want of skill.
Illustration
A employs B as a bricklayer in building a house, and puts up the scaffolding himself. The scaffolding is unskilfully put up, and B is in consequence
hurt. A must make compensation to B.
Effect of agency on contract with third persons

Enforcement and
consequences of agent's
contracts

226. Contracts entered into through an agent, and obligations arising from acts done by an agent, may be enforced in the same manner, and will
have the same legal consequences, as if the contracts had been entered into and the acts done by the principal in person.
Illustrations
(a) A buys goods from B, knowing that he is an agent for their sale, but not knowing who is the principal. B's principal is the person entitled to claim
from A the price of the goods, and A cannot, in a suit by the principal, set off against that claim a debt due to himself from B.
(b) A, being B's agent with authority to receive money on his behalf, receives from C a sum of money due to B. C is discharged of his obligation to
pay the sum in question to B.

Principal how far bound,
when agent exceeds
authority

227. When an agent does more than he is authorized to do, and when the part of what he does, which is within his authority, can be separated from
the part which is beyond his authority, so much only of what he does as is within his authority is binding as between him and his principal.
Illustration
A, being owner of a ship and cargo, authorizes B to procure an insurance for 4,000 Taka on the ship. B procures a policy for 4,000 Taka on the ship,
and another for the like sum on the cargo. A is bound to pay the premium for the policy on the ship, but not the premium for the policy on the cargo.

Principal not bound when
excess of agent's authority
is not separable

228. Where an agent does more than he is authorized to do, and what does beyond the scope of his authority cannot be separated from what is
within it, the principal is not bound to recognize the transaction.
Illustration
A authorizes B to buy 500 sheep for him. B buys 500 sheep and 200 lambs for one sum of 6,000 Taka. A may repudiate the whole transaction.

Consequences of notice
given to agent

229. Any notice given to or information obtained by the agent, provided it be given or obtained in the course of the business transacted by him for the
principal, shall, as between the principal and third parties, have the same legal consequences as if it had been given to or obtained by the principal.
Illustrations
(a) A is employed by B to buy from C certain goods, of which C is the apparent owner, and buys them accordingly. In the course of the treaty for the
sale, A learns that the goods really belonged to D, but B is ignorant of that fact, B is not entitled to set off a debt owing to him from C against the price
of the goods.
(b) A is employed by B to buy from C goods of which C is the apparent owner. A was, before he was so employed, a servant of C, and then learnt
that goods really belonged to D, but B is ignorant of that fact. In spite of the knowledge of his agent, B may set off against the price of the goods a
debt owing to him from C.

Agent cannot personally
enforce, nor be bound by,
contracts on behalf of
principal

230. In the absence of any contract to that effect, an agent cannot personally enforce contracts entered into by him on behalf of his principal, nor is
he personally bound by them.

Presumption of contract to
contrary

Such a contract shall be presumed to exist in the following cases:–
(1) where the contract is made by an agent for the sale or purchase of goods for a merchant resident abroad:
(2) where the agent does not disclose the name of his principal:
(3) where the principal, though disclosed, cannot be sued.

Rights of parties to a
contract made by agent
not disclosed

231. If an agent makes a contract with a person who neither knows, nor has reason to suspect, that he is an agent, his principal may require the
performance of the contract; but the other contracting party has, as against the principal, the same rights as he would have had as against the agent
if the agent had been principal.If the principal discloses himself before the contract is completed, the other contracting party may refuse to fulfil the
contract, if he can show that, if he had known who was the principal in the contract, or if he had known that the agent was not a principal, he would
not have entered into the contract.

Performance of contract
with agent supposed to be
principal

232. Where one man makes a contract with another, neither knowing nor having reasonable ground to suspect that the other is an agent, the
principal, if he requires the performance of the contract, can only obtain such performance subject to the rights and obligations subsisting between
the agent and the other party to the contract.
Illustration
A, who owes 500 Taka to B, sells 1,000 Taka worth of rice to B. A is acting as agent for C in the transaction, but B has no knowledge nor reasonable
ground of suspicion that such is the case. C cannot compel B to take the rice without allowing him to set off A's debt.

Right of person dealing
with agent personally
liable

233. In cases where the agent is personally liable, a person dealing with him may hold either him or his principal, or both of them, liable.

Consequence of inducing
agent or principal to act on
belief that principal or
agent will be held
exclusively liable

234. When a person who has made a contract with an agent induces the agent to act upon the belief that the principal only will be held liable, or
induces the principal to act upon the belief that the agent only will be held liable, he cannot afterwards hold liable the agent or principal respectively.

Liability of pretended
agent

235. A person untruly representing himself to be the authorized agent of another, and thereby inducing a third person to deal with him as such agent,
is liable, if his alleged employer does not ratify his acts, to make compensation to the other in respect of any loss or damage which he has incurred
by so dealing.

Person falsely contracting
as agent not entitled to
performance

236. A person with whom a contract has been entered into in the character of agent is not entitled to require the performance of it if he was in reality
acting, not as agent, but on his own account.

Liability of principal
inducing belief that agent's
unauthorized acts were
authorized

237. When an agent has, without authority, done acts or incurred obligations to third persons on behalf of his principal, the principal is bound by such
acts or obligations if he has by his words or conduct induced such third persons to believe that such acts and obligations were within the scope of the
agent's authority.

Illustration
A enters into a contract with B to sell him 100 bales of cotton, and afterwards discovers that B was acting as agent for C. A may sue either B or C, or
both, for the price of the cotton.

Illustrations
(a) A consigns goods to B for sale, and gives him instructions not to sell under a fixed price. C, being ignorant of B's instructions, enters into a
contract with B to buy the goods at a price lower than the reserved price. A is bound by the contract.
(b) A entrusts B with negotiable instruments endorsed in blank. B sells them to C in violation of private orders from A. The sale is good.

Effect, on agreement, of
misrepresentation or fraud
by agent

238. Misrepresentations made, or frauds committed, by agents acting in the course of their business for their principals, have the same effect on
agreements made by such agents as if such misrepresentations or frauds had been made or committed by the principals; but misrepresentations
made, or frauds committed, by agents, in matters which do not fall within their authority, do not affect their principals.
Illustrations
(a) A, being B's agent for the sale of goods, induces C to buy them by a misrepresentation, which he was not authorized by B to make. The contract
is voidable, as between B and C, at the option of C.
(b) A, the captain of B's ship, signs bills of lading without having received on board the goods mentioned therein. The bills of lading are void as
between B and the pretended consignor.
