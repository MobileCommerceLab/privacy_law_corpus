UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

2020 Edition
Preface
The “Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974,” prepared by the Department of Justice’s
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties (OPCL), constitutes a discussion of various
provisions of the Privacy Act, as addressed by court decisions in cases involving the
Act’s disclosure prohibition, its access and amendment provisions, and its agency
recordkeeping requirements. Tracking the provisions of the Act itself, the Overview
provides reference to and legal analysis of court decisions interpreting the Act. It is a
comprehensive -- but not exhaustive -- resource that describes the current state of the
law.
The Overview is not intended to provide policy guidance or create policy, as that role
statutorily rests with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and where OMB
has issued policy guidance on particular provisions of the Act, citation to such
guidance is provided in the Overview. The 2020 edition of the Overview includes
cases through April of 2020. It was published electronically in October 2020 and sent
for print publication in November 2020. The online version will be a living
document, and updated by OPCL in its discretion as appropriate.
OPCL is very pleased to provide this updated revision of the Overview, and could
not have done so without the commitment of OPCL’s dedicated staff and the
interagency Overview Working Group, who are recognized individually on the
accompanying masthead. The organization and development of legal materials are
the work product of OPCL, which is responsible for the Overview’s content.

INTRODUCTION
The Privacy Act of 1974, Pub Law No. 93-579, 88 Stat 1896 (Dec. 31, 1974), codified at
5 U.S.C. § 552a (2018), went into effect on September 27, 1975, when it became the
principal law governing the handling of personal information in the federal
government. Enacted in the wake of the Watergate and the Counterintelligence
Program (COINTELPRO) scandals involving illegal surveillance on opposition
political parties and individuals deemed to be “subversive,” the Privacy Act sought
to restore trust in government and to address what at the time was seen as an
existential threat to American democracy. In the words of the bill’s principal
sponsor, Judiciary Chairman Senator Sam Ervin, “[i]f we have learned anything in
this last year of Watergate, it is that there must be limits upon what the Government
can know about each of its citizens.” See S. Comm. on Gov’t. Operations & H.R.
Comm. on Gov’t. Operations, 94th Cong., Legislative History of the Privacy Act of
1974 S. 3418 (Public Law 93-579): Source Book on Privacy at 4 (Comm. Print 1976)
[hereinafter Source Book], https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook.
In drafting the Privacy Act, Congress relied on a recently published and widely read
report from an advisory committee of what was then the Department of Health,
Education & Welfare (HEW). Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens: Report
of the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, DHEW
Publication No. (OS) 73-94 (July 1973) (hereinafter HEW Report), https://www.justice
.gov/opcl/docs/rec-com-rights.pdf. The HEW Report represented the first
comprehensive study of the risks to privacy presented by the increasingly
widespread use of electronic information technologies by organizations, replacing
traditional paper-based systems of creation, storage, and retrieval of information. To
address these risks, the HEW Report developed what it called a “code of fair
information practices,” now more commonly called the Fair Information Practice
Principles, or FIPPs.
As implemented in the Privacy Act, the FIPPs: allow individuals to determine what
records pertaining to them are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by an
agency; require agencies to procure consent before records pertaining to an
individual collected for one purpose could be used for other incompatible purposes;
afford individuals a right of access to records pertaining to them and to have them
corrected if inaccurate; and require agencies to collect such records only for lawful
and authorized purposes and safeguard them appropriately. Exceptions from some
of these principles are permitted only for important reasons of public policy. Judicial
redress is afforded to individuals when an agency fails to comply with access and
amendment rights, but only after an internal appeals process fails to correct the
problem. Otherwise, liability for damages is afforded in the event of a willful or
intentional violation of these rights.
The FIPPs are not only central to the framework of the Privacy Act, they have been
the basis of almost every other privacy law and treaty in the world today. See, e.g.,
[1]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April
2016 on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal
Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data (known as the General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”)); The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6801; The Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) of 1996, 42 U.S.C. § 320d-2;
HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164; Directive
95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 (repealed
and replaced by the GDPR); Org. for Econ. Coop. & Dev., Guidelines on the
Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (rev. 2013). It is
therefore helpful to understand something about their origins.
The FIPPs were the brainchild of three people, the HEW Secretary’s Advisory
Committee Chairman Willis Ware, Executive Director David B. H. Martin, and
Associate Director Carole Parsons. Chairman Ware was a legendary computer
scientist and pioneer in the field of information security who had worked with John
Von Neumann and Claude Shannon building the first modern computer at the
Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Chairman Ware later diagnosed
fundamental vulnerabilities in what was then called the ARPANET (now renamed
INTERNET), and is recognized as the founder of the field of information security.
Executive Director Martin was the principal architect of the Cape Cod National
Seashore, a multi-stakeholder collaborative governance structure, which became the
model for the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970. Executive Director Martin
would go on to devise other innovative collaborative governance frameworks like
government-backed student loans. Associate Director Parsons was a National
Research Council expert on government administrative and scientific uses of
recorded personal information. She later served in the White House overseeing the
legislative process leading to the enactment of the Privacy Act, and as Executive
Director of the Privacy Protection Study Commission.
As explained by the authors of the HEW Report, underlying the FIPPs was an
understanding of the nature of electronic data as reflecting and mediating
relationships in which both individuals and organizations have an interest, made for
purposes that are shared by organizations and individuals. The concept of privacy
had, at that point in time, been understood as a narrow, property-based concept of
individual control. Unlike paper-based information systems, individuals cannot
exercise the same level of physical control of information in electronic computer
systems controlled by organizations. Accordingly, the authors of the HEW Report
argued that the concept of privacy needed to be reimagined to recognize the mutual
interests that institutions and individuals shared in the fair and appropriate
management of personal information. This meant that instead of a property-based
concept of individual control, what was needed was a governance framework
designed to ensure the trust of the stakeholders in the information. These included
[2]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

the individuals about whom the information pertained and the agency with a public
need to use the information, as well as others. As such, the model of the FIPPs
developed in the HEW Report bears close similarities to the framework for
management of shared common environmental resources, such as the Cape Cod
National Seashore, which Executive Director Martin had helped design.
As implemented in the Privacy Act, the multi-stakeholder governance idea
underlying the FIPPs can be seen in the fact that each of the individual rights that
Congress created also serves the interests of any reasonable agency, and is consistent
with the need for other legitimate secondary users, such as public health authorities,
financial oversight agencies, law enforcement and national security agencies—indeed
any stakeholder with a legitimate need to use the information in the public interest—
to access and appropriately use the information. Just as loss of trust in the
governance framework would harm the interests of all, so proper and appropriate
use of personal information within a secure governance framework would maintain
trust and benefit the interests of all.
The Ninety-Third United States Congress, facing a crisis of public trust, found the
information governance model of the FIPPs, as presented in the HEW Report, to be
an attractive approach. Following the breakdown of trust in the government after the
Watergate and COINTELPRO scandals, Congress recognized that agency
implementation of the FIPPs could help restore the most critical relationship of trust
of all, that between the people and their government.
In the more than 45 years since the Privacy Act was enacted, information
technologies have expanded in ways that the drafters of the HEW Report could never
have imagined, and the risks associated with the collection and use of personal data
have grown accordingly. But the basic principles of fair information practices as
implemented in the Act have continued to do their work maintaining the relationship
of trust between the people and their government. The Privacy Act was later
modified by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, Pub. L. No.
100-503, 102 Stat. 2507, extending the Privacy Act’s FIPPs-based protections to
computer-matching activities by agencies, with requirements for certain additional
internal agency procedures. The Privacy Act also has been supplemented by other
structures of information governance, such as the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub.
Law No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, and the Federal Information Security Modernization
Act of 2014, Pub. Law No. 113-283, 128 Stat. 3073. However, the original language of
the Privacy Act, as drafted in 1974, has shown itself sufficiently flexible to adapt to
those changes. More than any other law in the field, the Privacy Act has, to a
remarkable extent, withstood the test of time.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

A. Legislative History
Although the HEW Report provides key historical context for the Privacy Act,
the formal legislative history of the Privacy Act is contained in a convenient, onevolume compilation. See Source Book, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview
_sourcebook. The Act was passed in great haste during the final week of the
Ninety-Third United States Congress. No conference committee was convened
to reconcile differences in the bills passed by the House and Senate. Instead,
staffs of the respective committees – led by Senators Ervin and Percy, and
Representatives Moorhead and Erlenborn – prepared a final version of the bill
that was ultimately enacted. The original reports are thus of limited utility in
interpreting the final statute; the more reliable legislative history consists of a
brief analysis of the compromise amendments – entitled “Analysis of House and
Senate Compromise Amendments to the Federal Privacy Act” – prepared by the
staffs of the counterpart Senate and House committees and submitted in both the
House and Senate in lieu of a conference report. See 120 Cong. Rec. at 40, 405-09,
40,881-83, (1974), reprinted in Source Book, at 858-68, 987-94, https://www.justice
.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook.
B.

Privacy Protection Study Commission
Section 5 of the original Privacy Act established the “Privacy Protection Study
Commission” to evaluate the statute and to issue a report containing
recommendations for its improvement. See U.S. Priv. Prot. Study Comm’n,
Personal Privacy in an Information Society (1977) [hereinafter Privacy
Commission Report], https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_ppsc. Although the
Commission generated many ideas and discussions and issued its final report in
1977, it ceased operation that year and its recommendations did not result in
further legislation. See generally Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. 615, 622-23 (2004)
(considering mandate and recommendation of Privacy Protection Study
Commission as well as legislative history to interpret Privacy Act damages
provision).

Office of Management and Budget Guidance
“The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall—
(1) develop and, after notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe
guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in implementing the
provisions of this section; and

(Dec. 23, 2016) (notice of availability published at 81 Fed. Reg. 94,424)
[hereinafter OMB Circular A-108], https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-a108 (establishes general reporting requirements for the Privacy Act).
Most courts give the OMB guidelines and regulations the same deference they
give interpretations of an agency that has been charged with the administration
of a statute. See Sussman v. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1120 (D.C. Cir. 2007).
In Sussman, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit discussed
this standard: “Congress explicitly tasked the OMB with promulgating
guidelines for implementing the Privacy Act, and we therefore give the OMB
Guidelines ‘the deference usually accorded interpretation of a statute by the
agency charged with its administration.’” Id. (citation omitted) (citing Albright
v. United States, 631 F.2d 915, 920 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). With regard to the OMB
1975 Guidelines, the court stated: “The OMB apparently invited no public
comment prior to publishing its guidelines, and after we decided Albright,
Congress pointedly replaced its original grant of authority to the OMB with one
that expressly required the OMB to respect such procedural niceties before its
guidelines could be binding. But Congress made clear the change was not meant
to disturb existing guidelines. Hence, the old OMB Guidelines still deserve the
same level of deference they enjoyed prior to the 1998 amendment.” Sussman,
494 F.3d at 1120 n.8 (citations omitted). Numerous cases have applied this
standard of deference. See, e.g., Maydak v. United States, 363 F.3d 512, 518 (D.C.
Cir. 2004); Henke v. Commerce, 83 F.3d 1453, 1460 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Quinn v.
Stone, 978 F.2d 126, 133 (3d Cir. 1992); Baker v. Navy, 814 F.2d 1381, 1383 (9th
Cir. 1987); Perry v. FBI, 759 F.2d 1271, 1276 n.7 (7th Cir. 1985), rev’d en banc on

77-5011, slip op. at 8-9 (D.S.D. Mar. 15, 1978); see also Martin v. Office of Special
Counsel, 819 F.2d 1181, 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (OMB interpretation is “worthy of
our attention and solicitude.”).
The United States Supreme Court has not gone that far, however. See Doe v.
Chao, 540 U.S. at 620 n.11 (disagreeing with dissent’s reliance on OMB
interpretation of damages provision and stating that Court does “not find its
unelaborated conclusion persuasive”). In addition, a few courts have rejected
particular aspects of the OMB guidelines and regulations as inconsistent with the
statute. See Wrocklage v. DHS, 769 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2014)

D. Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act
The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 amended the
Privacy Act to add several new provisions. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(8)-(13), (e)(12),
(o), (p), (q), (r), (u) (2018). These provisions add procedural requirements for
agencies to follow when engaging in computer-matching activities, provide
matching subjects with opportunities to receive notice and to refute adverse
information before having a benefit denied or terminated, and require that
agencies engaged in matching activities to establish Data Protection Boards to
oversee those activities. These provisions became effective on December 31,
1989. OMB’s guidelines on computer matching should be consulted in this area.
See, e.g., OMB 1989 Guidelines, 54 Fed. Reg. at 25,818-29, https://www.justice.
gov/paoverview_omb-89-cma. Subsequently, Congress enacted the Computer
Matching and Privacy Protection Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508
§7201, 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-334, which further clarified the due process provisions
found in subsection (p). See also OMB CMPPA Guidelines, 56 Fed. Reg. at
18,599, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-91-cma. Although there has
not been significant litigation on this provision to date, in one recent case, the
court considered the requirements of the computer matching amendments and
concluded that the agency had not met them. See Calvillo Manriquez v. DeVos,
345 F. Supp. 3d 1077, 1098 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (concluding that because sharing of
data between the SSA and the Dep’t of Educ. was “a matching program as
defined by the Privacy Act, the agencies must comply with the requirements. . .
[and] [i]t is undisputed that the [agency and SSA] did not comply with the
requirements above and thus violated the Privacy Act”).
The highly complex and specialized provisions of the Computer Matching and
Privacy Protection Act of 1988 and the Computer Matching and Privacy
Protection Amendments of 1990 are not further addressed herein. Additional
guidance on these provisions can be found in the OMB 1989 Guidelines and
OMB CMPPA Guidelines, cited above.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

JUDICIAL REDRESS ACT
In 2016, the Congress enacted and the President signed the Judicial Redress Act of
2015. 5 U.S.C. § 552a note (2018). Section 2 of the Judicial Redress Act extends the
right to pursue certain civil remedies under the Privacy Act to citizens of designated
foreign countries or regional economic organizations. It provides in pertinent part:
(a) CIVIL ACTION; CIVIL REMEDIES. – With respect to covered records, a
covered person may bring a civil action against an agency and obtain civil
remedies, in the same manner, to the same extent, and subject to the same
limitations, including exemptions and exceptions, as an individual may bring
and obtain with respect to records under –
(1) section 552a(g)(1)(D) of title 5, United States Code, but only with respect
to disclosures intentionally or willfully made in violation of section 552a(b)
of such title; and
(2) subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 552a(g)(1) of title 5, United States
Code, but such an action may only be brought against a designated Federal
agency or component.
(b) EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES. – The remedies set forth in subsection (a) are the
exclusive remedies available to a covered person under this section.
(c) APPLICATION OF THE PRIVACY ACT WITH RESPECT TO A
COVERED PERSON. – For purposes of a civil action described in subsection
(a), a covered person shall have the same rights, and be subject to the same
limitations, including exemptions and exceptions, as an individual has and is
subject to under section 552a of title 5, United States Code, when pursuing the
civil remedies described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a).” Section 2
of the Judicial Redress Act of 2015, 5 U.S.C. § 552a note (2018).

economic organizations, in the same manner, to the same extent, and subject to
the same limitations, including exemptions and exceptions, as an individual may
bring and obtain with respect to: (1) intentional or willful unlawful disclosures of
a covered record under subsection (g)(1)(D); and (2) improper refusal by a
designated Federal agency or component to grant a covered person access to or
amendment of a covered record under subsection (g)(1)(A) & (B). For more
information on judicial redress rights under the Privacy Act, see “Civil
Remedies” subsections below: “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A) - Amendment Lawsuits,”
“5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(B) - Access Lawsuits,” “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C) - Damages
Lawsuits for Failure to Assure Fairness in Agency Determination,” “5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(1)(D) - Damages Lawsuits for Failure to Comply with Other Privacy
Act Provisions.”
As described in the House Committee Report on the Judicial Redress Act, the Act
was primarily enacted to complement an anticipated agreement between the
United States and the European Union (“EU”) harmonizing legal protections of
personal information shared between the United States and EU member states
for the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offenses:
For many years, the European Union and many of its member states
have complained to U.S. officials about the fact that the Privacy Act
of 1974 only applies to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents,
and not to foreign citizens. Although other U.S. laws provide any
person with judicial remedies for specified types of privacy
violations, the absence of a broader right of action with respect to
privacy violations by the Federal Government has remained a point
of friction with the European Union. Complaints have accelerated
as it has become possible, due to digitalization of the economy, and
indeed necessary for public security reasons, for U.S. and EU law
enforcement agencies to exchange increasing quantities of
information. In contrast to the Privacy Act, U.S. citizens have rights
under EU and member state data protection laws to challenge
adverse decisions by European government agencies in court.
...
[T]he United States has been in the process of negotiating a Data
Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA, often referred to as the
“umbrella agreement”) with the European Union, in order to
address the EU desire for clear standards governing the privacy of
personal information exchanged for law enforcement purposes. The
United States entered into these negotiations in order to ensure that
robust information sharing with Europe for law enforcement
purposes will continue. During the course of the negotiations, the

European Commission and Parliament have both made it clear that
there will be no agreement without the enactment of a U.S. law that
enables EU citizens to sue the U.S. government for major privacy
violations.
H.R. Rep. No. 114-294, at 2-3 (2015) (Judicial Redress Act).
The District Court for the District of Columbia has exclusive jurisdiction over claims
arising under the Judicial Redress Act.
Unlike the Privacy Act’s jurisdictional provisions for its civil remedies, the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia has exclusive
jurisdiction over any claim arising under the Judicial Redress Act. § 2(g).
Currently, the D.C. District Court has not substantively interpreted the
provisions in the Judicial Redress Act. As a result, the text of the Act, its
legislative history, and the Attorney General’s designations serve as the best
source material for interpreting the Judicial Redress Act.
The Judicial Redress Act applies to citizens of “covered countries,” so designated by the
Attorney General.
The Judicial Redress Act affords “covered persons” – defined as natural persons
(other than an “individual” as defined under the Privacy Act) who are citizens of
a covered country – with civil remedies as provided for in the Act. § 2(h)(3). A
“covered country” is a country or regional economic integration organization, or
member country of such organization, that has been designated by the Attorney
General, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the
Treasury, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to have met certain
protections outlined in Section 2(d)(1) of the Judicial Redress Act. Id. § 2(h)(5).
Civil remedies under the Judicial Redress Act are limited to claims involving “covered
records.”
The Judicial Redress Act’s civil remedies are limited to a “covered record,” id.
§ 2(a), which, for a covered person, has the same meaning as a “record” under
the Privacy Act (see subsection for “5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(4) - Record” in “Definitions”
below ), once the covered record is transferred – (A) by a public authority of, or
private entity within, a country or regional economic organization, or member
country of such organization, which at the time the record is transferred is a
covered country; and (B) to “a designated Federal agency or component” for
purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting, or prosecuting criminal
offenses. Id. § 2(h)(4). A covered person’s right to access or amend a covered

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

record is limited to only those covered records maintained by a designated
Federal agency or component. See id. § 2(a).
The Attorney General is responsible for designating Federal agencies and components for
purposes of the Judicial Redress Act.
The Attorney General determines that an agency or component of an agency is a
“designated Federal agency or component” if: (1) the information exchanged by
such agency, or component thereof, with a covered country is within the scope of
an agreement with the United States that provides for appropriate privacy
protections for information shared for the purpose of preventing, investigating,
detecting, or prosecuting criminal offenses; or (2) designating such agency, or
component thereof, is in the law enforcement interests of the United States. Id.
§ 2(e), (h)(5).
B.

Attorney General Designations Related to the U.S.-EU Data Protection and
Privacy Agreement
Comment:
The Data Protection and Privacy Agreement between the United States and the
European Union and its Member States, provides privacy protections for information
shared to prevent, investigate, detect, or prosecute criminal offenses.
As referenced in the House Committee Report, the U.S. Government’s efforts to
enact the Judicial Redress Act were, in part, a response to negotiations of an
Executive Agreement between the United States and the EU relating to privacy
protections for personal information transferred between the U.S., the EU, and
the EU Member States for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution
of criminal offenses – commonly known as the “Data Protection and Privacy
Agreement” (“DPPA”) or the “Umbrella Agreement.” See Agreement on the
Protection of Personal Information Relating to the Prevention, Investigation,
Detection, and Prosecution of Criminal Offenses, U.S.-EU, June 2, 2016, 17 U.S.T.
201, https://www.justice.gov/us-eu_dppa.
The DPPA went into force on February 1, 2017, and established a set of
protections that the United States and the EU must apply to personal
information exchanged for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating, or
prosecuting criminal offenses. The DPPA establishes an obligation for the
United States and the EU to provide, in their respective domestic laws, specific
judicial redress rights to each other’s citizens. Id. at Art. 19. The Judicial Redress
Act is implementing legislation for Article 19 of the DPPA.

DEFINITIONS
A. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(1) - Agency
“[T]he term ‘agency’ means any Executive department, military department,
Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other
establishment in the executive branch of the [federal] Government (including the
Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.” 5
U.S.C. § 552a(a)(1) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) (2018), which in turn
incorporates 5 U.S.C. § 551(1) (2018)).
Comment:
Executive branch agencies, their components, and government-controlled entities are
“agencies.”
The Privacy Act – like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552 –
applies only to a federal Executive Branch “agency,” and it incorporates the
FOIA’s definition of “agency.” See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. 28,950-51,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75; 120 Cong. Rec. at 40,408, reprinted
in Source Book at 866, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook
(discussing scope of the Act’s “agency” definition and its application to
components of agencies, i.e., agencies within agencies). The Privacy Act “is
intended to give ‘agency’ its broadest statutory meaning” so records can be
transferred between the various offices and components that comprise an agency
on a “need-for-the-record basis.” 120 Cong. Rec. at 36,967, reprinted in Source
Book at 958, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook (providing
DOJ as example of an “agency” and recognizing propriety of subsection (b)(1)
“need to know” disclosures between its various components, e.g., FBI, DEA, and
ATF). See also Cloonan v. Holder, 768 F. Supp. 2d 154, 162 (D.D.C. 2011)
(“[N]aming components as defendants under the Privacy Act is appropriate
since the statute’s plain language is clear that ‘an agency need not be a cabinetlevel agency such as the DOJ to be liable.’” (quoting Lair v. Treasury, No. 03 Civ.
827, 2005 WL 645228 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2005)); but see Iqbal v. FBI, No. 3:11-cv369, 2012 WL 2366634, at *4 (M.D. Fla. June 21, 2012) (declining to dismiss “just
because the Plaintiff brought his claims against the FBI instead of the
Department of Justice”).
The Privacy Act applies to government corporations and government-controlled
corporations, and it is intended to apply to establishments like the Postal Service
and the Postal Regulatory Commission. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(1); 120 Cong. Rec.
at 40,408, reprinted in Source Book at 866, https://www.justice.gov/opcl

/paoverview_sourcebook (indicating congressional intent for Privacy Act to
apply to Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission (later renamed the Postal
Regulatory Commission)); NLRB v. USPS, 841 F.2d 141, 144 n.3 (6th Cir. 1988)
(Postal Service is an “agency” because it is an “independent establishment of the
executive branch”).
Courts may look at the characteristics of establishments to determine whether
they are “agencies” under the Privacy Act. See, e.g., Thompson v. State, 400 F.
Supp. 2d 1, 21-22 (D.D.C. 2005) (finding Foreign Service Grievance Board to be
an “agency” because it “consists of members appointed exclusively by an
executive department, administers federal statutes, promulgates regulations, and
adjudicates the rights of individuals”). Courts may consider non-federal entities
to be “agencies” under the Privacy Act when the non-federal entities operate
establishments that are under the supervision and control of federal Executive
Branch agencies pursuant to contracts in which the non-federal entities agree to
comply with the Act. See Shannon v. Gen. Elec. Co., 812 F. Supp. 308, 313, 315
n.5 (N.D.N.Y. 1993) (“no dispute” that GE falls within definition of “agency”
subject to requirements of Privacy Act where, pursuant to contract, it operated
Department of Energy-owned lab under supervision, control, and oversight of
Department and where by terms of contract GE agreed to comply with Privacy
Act).
The White House, federal courts, and entities merely linked to the government are not
“agencies.”
With regard to the White House, courts have held that those components of the
Executive Office of the President whose sole function is to advise and assist the
President are not “agencies” for purposes of the Privacy Act. See, e.g.,
Alexander v. FBI, 456 F. App’x 1, 2 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (per curiam), aff’d 691 F.
Supp. 2d 182 (D.D.C. 2010) (determining case’s prior contrary interpretation, 971
F. Supp. 603, 606-07 (D.D.C. 1997), was “no longer the correct one”); Falwell v.
Exec. Office of the President, 113 F. Supp. 2d 967, 968-70 (W.D. Va. 2000). In fact,
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit observed that
“Congress did not inadvertently omit the Offices of the President and Vice
President from the Privacy Act’s disclosure requirements.” Wilson v. Libby, 535
F.3d 697, 708 (D.C. Cir. 2008).
Federal entities outside of the executive branch are not subject to the Act. See,
e.g., Hankerson v. U.S. Dep’t of Prob. & Parole, No. 5:13-CV-78, 2014 WL 533495,
at *1 (M.D. Ga. Feb. 7, 2014) (federal courts); Goddard v. Whitmer, No. 09-CV404, 2010 WL 116744, at *2 (E.D. Ky. Jan. 6, 2010) (federal courts); Cobell v.

re Adair, 212 B.R. 171, 173 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1997) (federal bankruptcy court).
Similarly, the Smithsonian Institution, although having many “links” with the
federal government, “is not an agency for Privacy Act purposes.” Dong v.
Smithsonian Inst., 125 F.3d 877, 879-80 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also Dodge v. Trs. of
Nat’l Gallery of Art, 326 F. Supp. 2d 1, 10-11 (D.D.C. 2004) (finding that “the
National Gallery is a Smithsonian Museum” and explaining that “Smithsonian
Museums . . . are not subjected to the limitations of the Privacy Act because they
do not fall within the definition of an ‘agency’”). Amtrak is another entity with
links to the federal government that the courts have held is not an “agency”
under the Privacy Act. See United States v. Jackson, 381 F.3d 984, 989-90 (10th
Cir. 2004) (citing Ehm, infra, and holding that Amtrak is not an “agency”); Ehm
v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 732 F.2d 1250, 1252-55 (5th Cir. 1984) (Amtrak held
not to constitute a “Government-controlled corporation”).
State and local government agencies are not “agencies” under the Privacy Act.
State and local government agencies are not covered by the Privacy Act. See,
e.g., Clancy v. Fla. Dep’t of Corr., 782 F. App’x 779, 781 (11th Cir. 2019) (finding
Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision to be an agency of
compacting states that is not subject to Privacy Act); Hatfield v. Berube, 714 F.

Additionally, neither federal funding nor regulation converts state and local
entities into covered agencies. See St. Michaels Convalescent Hosp. v. California,
643 F.2d 1369, 1373 (9th Cir. 1981); Logan v. Matveevskii, 57 F. Supp. 3d 234, 27576 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (finding federally subsidized housing authorities are not
agencies under Privacy Act); Adelman v. Discover Card Servs., 915 F. Supp.
1163, 1166 (D. Utah 1996).
Likewise, the Privacy Act does not apply to tribal entities, the governments of
territories or possessions of the United States, or the District of Columbia’s
government. See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1) (specifically excluding governments of
territories or possessions of U.S. and government of D.C. from statutory
definition of “agency” incorporated into Privacy Act); Neptune v. Nicholas, No.
1:17-cv-88-GZS, 2017 WL 1102716, at *2 (D. Me. Mar. 24, 2017) (unpublished table

(acknowledging Privacy Act does not apply to D.C.). However, the D.C. Circuit
has held that National Guard units are within the Privacy Act’s definition of
“agency” at all times – not just when they are on active federal duty. See In re
Sealed Case, 551 F.3d 1047, 1049-50 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (concluding that “Privacy
Act’s definition of agency includes federally recognized National Guard units at

Sealed Case).
An exception to the rule that state and local entities are not “agencies” under the
Privacy Act, however, is the social security number usage restrictions contained
in section 7 of the Privacy Act, which do apply to federal, state, and local
government agencies. Pub. L. No. 93-579, § 7, 88 Stat. 1896, 1909 (codified at 5
U.S.C. § 552a note, “Disclosure of Social Security Number”). This special

Individual agency officials generally are not considered “agencies.”
A civil action under the Privacy Act is properly filed against an “agency” only,
not against an individual, a government official, an employee, or the United
States. See, e.g., Palmieri v. United States, 896 F.3d 579, 586 (D.C. Cir. 2018)

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Furthermore, “courts have consistently declined to imply a Bivens-style right of
action against individual officers for conduct that would be actionable under the
Privacy Act.” Gordon v. Gutierrez, No. 1:06cv861, 2006 WL 3760134, at *3 (E.D.
Va. Dec. 14, 2006). One court also noted, though, that while a Privacy Act action
“must be maintained against an agency,” it is “unaware of any authority which
requires the Plaintiffs to specifically name, either as an individual defendant or
within the body of a complaint, each and every agency employee who may have
contributed to an alleged Privacy Act violation.” Buckles v. Indian Health Serv.,
305 F. Supp. 2d 1108, 1112 (D.N.D. 2004).
The District Court for the District of Columbia has explained that “[i]n order for
an agency to be liable for a Privacy Act violation allegedly committed by one of
its employees, the responsible agency employee must have been acting within
the scope of his or her employment.” Convertino v. DOJ, 769 F. Supp. 2d 139,
147 (D.D.C. 2011) (“Therefore, even if [plaintiff] could prove that the leak must
have come from a DOJ employee – which he cannot – his claim would fail
because no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that any such DOJ employee
was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time of the leak.”),
rev’d and remanded on other grounds, 684 F.3d 93 (D.C. Cir. 2012).
Some courts have held that the head of an agency, if sued in his or her official
capacity, can be a proper party defendant under the Privacy Act. See Hampton
v. FBI, No. 93-0816, slip op. at 8, 10-11 (D.D.C. June 30, 1995); Jarrell v. Tisch, 656
F. Supp. 237, 238 (D.D.C. 1987); Diamond v. FBI, 532 F. Supp. 216, 219-20
(S.D.N.Y. 1981), aff’d, 707 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1983); Nemetz v. Treasury, 446 F.
Supp. 102, 106 (N.D. Ill. 1978); Rowe v. Tennessee, 431 F. Supp. 1257, 1264 (M.D.
Tenn. 1977), vacated on other grounds, 609 F.2d 259 (6th Cir. 1979); cf. Cloonan,
768 F. Supp. 2d at 162 (“find[ing] that plaintiff’s error in naming only individual
defendants was harmless” because “[o]n its face, the Complaint makes clear that
in naming former attorney general Michael Mukasey, plaintiff was naming the
Department of Justice as a defendant” and because complaint named Attorney
General only in his official capacity). But see Williams v. Fanning, 63 F. Supp. 3d
88, 90 n.2 (D.D.C. 2014) (dismissing Secretary of Air Force and Commanding
Officer of Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center as improper parties under
Privacy Act and proceeding with Air Force as only proper defendant under
Privacy Act).
Suits against agency heads by pro se plaintiffs may be more likely to be
construed as suits against the respective agencies because pro se pleadings are
construed liberally. See Walker, 647 F. Supp. 2d at 536. Further, leave to amend
a complaint to substitute a proper party defendant ordinarily is freely granted
where the agency is on notice of the claim. See, e.g., Reyes v. Supervisor of DEA,

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

834 F.2d 1093, 1097 (1st Cir. 1987); Petrus, 833 F.2d at 583. But cf. Doe v. Rubin,
No. 95-CV-75874, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14755, at *9 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 10, 1998)
(granting summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff had named Secretary
of Treasury as sole defendant and had filed no motion to amend). In addition, at
least one court has held that while the head of an agency is not a proper
defendant under the Privacy Act, an agency can waive any objections to the
naming of an improper party if it received proper notice of the action and did
not dispute its designation as a defendant. See Bavido v. Apfel, 215 F.3d 743, 747
(7th Cir. 2000) (finding SSA Commissioner was not proper party defendant, but
SSA had waived any objection as to naming of proper party agency defendant).
Note that a prosecution enforcing the Privacy Act’s criminal penalties provision,
5 U.S.C. § 552a(i) (see “Criminal Penalties” discussion, below), would properly
be filed against an individual. See Stone v. Def. Investigative Serv., 816 F. Supp.
782, 785 (D.D.C. 1993) (“Under the Privacy Act, this Court has jurisdiction over
individually named defendants only for unauthorized disclosure in violation of
5 U.S.C. § 552a(i).”); see also Hampton, No. 93-0816, slip op. at 8, 10-11 (citing
Stone).

5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(2) - Individual
“[T]he term ‘individual’ means a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(2).
Comment:
The Privacy Act’s definition of “individual” is much narrower than the FOIA’s
definition of “person,” which draws from the Administrative Procedures Act.
See 5 U.S.C. § 551(2) (2018) (defining person as “an individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or public or private organization other than an
agency.”); see also, e.g., Raven, 583 F.2d at 170-71 (comparing “use of the word
‘individual’ in the Privacy Act, as opposed to the word ‘person,’ as more broadly
used in the FOIA”); Cudzich v. INS, 886 F. Supp. 101, 105 (D.D.C. 1995) (A
plaintiff whose permanent resident status had been revoked “is not an
‘individual’ for the purposes of the Privacy Act. . . . Plaintiff’s only potential
access to the requested information is therefore under the Freedom of
Information Act.”).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The Privacy Act generally covers citizens and lawful permanent residents, but others
have some protections.
Generally, individuals under the Privacy Act are US citizens and lawful
permanent residents. See S. Rep. No. 93-1183, at 79, reprinted in Source Book at
232, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook; OMB 1975
Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,951, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75.
The Privacy Act as initially enacted did not generally protect non-resident
foreign nationals. See, e.g., Raven v. Panama Canal Co., 583 F.2d 169, 170-71 (5th
Cir. 1978) (referencing legislative history that “reflects the congressional intent to
exclude nonresident aliens from Privacy Act coverage”); Soto v. State, 244 F.
Supp. 3d 207, 208-09 (D.D.C. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished table decision)
(citing Fares v. INS, 50 F.3d 6 (4th Cir. 1995)) (“[Privacy] Act only protects
citizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent
residence.”).
The Judicial Redress Act of 2015, however, enables citizens of certain foreign
countries to bring suit under certain provisions of the Privacy Act in the same
manner as U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a
note. The Judicial Redress Act is discussed further under “Judicial Redress Act”
above.
In addition, the OMB 1975 Guidelines provide that while the Act does not apply
to records pertaining solely to non-resident foreign nationals, “[w]here a system
of records covers both citizens and nonresident aliens, only that portion which
relates to citizens or resident aliens is subject to the Act but agencies are

The definition of “maintain” embraces various activities with respect to records

_omb-75. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently
[26]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

considered the meaning of “maintain” in the context of records describing First
Amendment activity. Garris v. FBI, 937 F.3d 1284, 1300 (9th Cir. 2019). The
Ninth Circuit presumed that because Congress defined “maintain” to include
“maintain” and “collect,” Congress intended the provision to apply to distinct
activities. Id. at 1295. For an agency to “maintain” a record describing how an
individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment “pertinent to and
within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity,” the Ninth Circuit
found that, “to give each of these verbs its meaning,” the most reasonable
reading of the statute as a whole is that the record must be pertinent to an
authorized law enforcement activity both “at the time of gathering, i.e.,
collecting, [and] at the time of keeping, i.e., maintaining.” Id. at 1295 (quoting J.
Roderick MacArthur Found. v. FBI, 102 F.3d 600, 607 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Tatel, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part)). See also, e.g., Albright v. United
States, 631 F.2d 915, 918-20 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (analyzing scope of term “maintain”
in context of subsection (e)(7) challenge to record describing First Amendmentprotected activity and stating that “the Act clearly prohibits even the mere
collection of such a record, independent of the agency’s maintenance, use or
dissemination of it thereafter”).
D. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(4) - Record
“[T]he term ‘record’ means any item, collection, or grouping of information
about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited
to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or
employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number,
symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a
finger or voice print or a photograph.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(4).
Comment:
A Privacy Act “record” must identify an individual.
To qualify as a Privacy Act “record,” the information must identify an
individual. See, e.g., Reuber v. United States, 829 F.2d 133, 142 (D.C. Cir. 1987)
(concluding that letter reprimanding individual sent to and disclosed by agency
was “record” because it clearly identified individual by name and address);
Albright, 631 F.2d 915 at 920 (citing subsection (e)(7) case holding that videotape
of meeting constituted “record” because “[a]s long as the tape contains a means
of identifying an individual by picture or voice, it falls within the definition of a
‘record’ under the Privacy Act”); Fleming v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., No. 01 C 6289,
2002 WL 252459, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 21, 2002) (citing Robinson, 1988 WL 5083, at
*1) (holding that summary of investigation of plaintiff disclosed in semi-annual

report to Congress did not identify plaintiff and thus did not constitute a
“record” because disclosure “would have identified plaintiff only to an
individual who had other information that would have caused that individual to
infer from the report that plaintiff was the subject of the investigation”); cf.
Speaker v. HHS Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, 623 F.3d 1371, 1383-87
n.12 (11th Cir. 2010) (reversing district court’s dismissal of complaint, finding
that complaint sufficiently alleged that CDC disclosed plaintiff’s identity); Cacho
v. Chertoff, No. 06-00292, 2006 WL 3422548, at *6 n.3 (D.D.C. Nov. 28, 2006)
(declining to decide “the novel issue of whether a disclosure of the absence of
information from a system of records can constitute the disclosure of a record”;
given that plaintiff deliberately did not report his health problems, “accepting
plaintiff’s characterization of his failure to report them as itself constituting a
record that is afforded protection by the Privacy Act would stretch the meaning
of the statute beyond its intended purpose”).
The OMB 1975 Guidelines state that the term “record” means “any item of
information about an individual that includes an individual identifier,” and “can
include as little as one descriptive item about an individual.” 40 Fed. Reg. at
28,951-52, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (quoting legislative
history appearing at 120 Cong. Rec. 40,408, 40,883 (1974), reprinted in Source
Book at 866, 993, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook).
The courts of appeals have established differing tests for identifying a “record” under the
Act.
Several courts of appeals have articulated tests for determining whether an item
qualifies as a “record” under the Privacy Act, resulting in different tests for
determining whether information meets the “record” definition:
1.

Broad Definition - Any Record Linked to Individual’s Identifying
Information
Consistent with the OMB 1975 Guidelines, the Courts of Appeals for the
Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits have broadly interpreted the term
“record” to include any record that is linked to an individual through
identifying information. See Bechhoefer v. DEA, 209 F.3d 57 (2d Cir. 2000);
Williams v. VA, 104 F.3d 670, 673-74 (4th Cir. 1997); Quinn v. Stone, 978 F.2d
126 (3d Cir. 1992). The Third Circuit held that the term “record”
“encompass[es] any information about an individual that is linked to that
individual through an identifying particular” and is not “limited to
information which taken alone directly reflects a characteristic or quality.”
Quinn, 978 F.2d at 133 (holding that out-of-date home address on roster and
[28]

Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

time card information are records covered by the Privacy Act). The Second
Circuit, after analyzing the tests established by the other courts of appeals,
adopted a test “much like the Third Circuit’s test.” Bechhoefer, 209 F.3d at
60. The Second Circuit did so for three reasons. First, it found the Third
Circuit’s test to be “most consistent with the ‘broad terms’ . . . of the
statutory definition.” Id. Second, it found the Third Circuit’s test to be the
only one consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in DOD v. FLRA, 510
U.S. 487, 494 (1994), which held that federal civil service employees’ home
addresses qualified for protection under the Privacy Act. Bechhoefer, 209
F.3d at 61. Finally, it found the Third Circuit’s test to be supported by the
legislative history of the Privacy Act and OMB guidelines and regulations.
Id. at 61-62. The Second Circuit held that the term “record” “has ‘a broad
meaning encompassing,’ at the very least, any personal information ‘about
an individual that is linked to that individual through an identifying
particular.’” Id. at 62 (quoting Quinn and holding that letter containing
plaintiff’s name and “several pieces of ‘personal information’ about him,
including his address, his voice/fax telephone number, his employment, and
his membership in [an association],” were “records” covered by Privacy
Act).
The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has also construed the term
“record” broadly, holding that “the legislative history of the Act makes it
clear that a ‘record’ was meant to ‘include as little as one descriptive item
about an individual,’” and finding that “draft” materials qualified as
“records” because they “substantially pertain to Appellant,” “contain
‘information about’ [him], as well as his ‘name’ or ‘identifying number,’”
and “do more than merely apply to him”). Williams, 104 F.3d at 673-74
(quoting Source Book at 866, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview
_sourcebook).
Several district courts also have applied a broad interpretation of the term
“record.” See, e.g., Akmal v. United States, No. C12–1499, 2014 WL 906231,
at *2 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 7, 2014) (finding that “[a]gency employee names,
addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth are ‘records’ covered by the
Privacy Act”); Walia v. Napolitano, 986 F. Supp. 2d 169, 186 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)
(finding that documents maintained by DHS in Plaintiff’s employment and
personnel files, including plaintiff’s EEO activity, “may qualify as ‘records’
[in the broadest sense] because they identify the Plaintiff by name and
contain information about a prospective investigation premised on the
Plaintiff’s alleged misconduct”); Arruda & Beaudoin v. Astrue, No. 11–
10254, 2013 WL 1309249, at *10 (D. Mass. Mar. 27, 2013) (quoting Bechhoefer
and finding “queries satisfy these criteria” as “record” under the Privacy
[29]

Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Act); Sullivan v. USPS, 944 F. Supp. 191, 196 (W.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding that
disclosing to plaintiff’s employer that applicant had applied for employment
with Postal Service constituted disclosure of “record” under Privacy Act;
mere fact of record’s existence was sufficient to constitute record because
applicant’s name was part of information contained in application and
Postal Service disclosed that particular applicant by that name had applied
for employment).
2.

Narrow Definition - Record Must Reflect Individual Quality or
Characteristic
The Courts of Appeals for the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have limited
Privacy Act coverage by adopting a narrow construction of the term
“record” and requiring that the information “must reflect some quality or
characteristic of the individual involved.” Boyd v. Sec’y of the Navy, 709
F.2d 684, 686 (11th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (although stating narrow test,
finding that memorandum reflecting “Boyd’s failure to follow the chain of
command and his relationship with management” qualified as Privacy Act
record); accord Unt v. Aerospace Corp.,765 F.2d 1440, 1448-49 (9th Cir. 1985)
(finding letter written by employee – containing allegations of
mismanagement against corporation that led to his dismissal – held not his
“record” because it was “about” corporation and reflected “only indirectly
on any quality or characteristic” of employee); but see Unt, 765 F.2d at 144950 (Ferguson, J., dissenting) (opining that majority’s narrow interpretation of
term “record” “is illogical, contrary to the legislative intent, and defies the
case laws’ consistent concern with the actual effect of a record on a person’s
employment when assessing that record’s nature or subject”).

3.

Middle Ground - Record Must be “About” Individual, But Need Not
Reflect Quality or Characteristic
The Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia and Fifth Circuits have
staked out the middle ground. See Pierce v. Air Force, 512 F.3d 184, 188 (5th
Cir. 2007); Tobey v. NLRB, 40 F.3d 469, 471 (D.C. Cir. 1994). The D.C.
Circuit held that to qualify as a “record,” the information “must both be
‘about’ an individual and include his name or other identifying particular.”
Tobey, 40 F.3d at 471. The D.C. Circuit rejected the Third Circuit’s
determination in Quinn that information could qualify as a record “if that
piece of information were linked with an identifying particular (or was itself
an identifying particular),” because “[it] fails to require that information
both be ‘about’ an individual and be linked to that individual by an
identifying particular.” Id. (discussing Quinn, 978 F.2d at 133).
[30]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

On the other hand, the D.C. Circuit found the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits’
definitions in Unt and Boyd too narrow, stating that: “So long as the
information is ‘about’ an individual, nothing in the Act requires that it
additionally be about a ‘quality or characteristic’ of the individual.” Tobey,
40 F.3d at 472. Ultimately, the D.C. Circuit concluded that an NLRB
computer system for tracking and monitoring cases did not constitute a
system of records because its files contained no information “about”
individuals, despite the fact that the information contained the initials or
identifying number of the field examiner assigned to the case. Id. at 471-73.
Although the court recognized that the case information could be, and
apparently was, used in connection with other information to draw
inferences about a field examiner’s job performance, it stated that that “does
not transform the [computer system] files into records about field
examiners.” Id. at 472-73. See also Sussman v. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d
1106, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“[the record] must actually describe him in some
way”); Houghton v. State, 875 F. Supp. 2d 22, 34-36 (D.D.C. 2012) (following
standard set out in Tobey and determining transcripts at issue were not
“about” plaintiff but rather “about a Memorandum of Understanding
[between governments]” and “[e]ven the parts of the transcripts that
mention [plaintiff] are about a letter he wrote that was published . . . not
about him … The mere fact that the transcripts contain reference to or quote
from plaintiff’s written work is not sufficient to make it a ‘record.”); Aguirre
v. SEC, 671 F. Supp. 2d 113, 121-22 (D.D.C. 2009) (following Sussman and
concluding that where plaintiff sought “records of an investigation of his
allegation that the SEC “fired [him] for questioning” the decision to give
“preferential treatment to one of Wall Street’s elite,” plaintiff had “alleged
that the records describe the reasons for his termination” and, therefore it
was, “at the very least, plausible that these records . . . describe him in some
way”); Hatfill v. Gonzalez, 505 F. Supp. 2d 33, 35-39 (D.D.C. 2007)
(concluding that information in news articles and reports concerning
plaintiff’s suspected involvement in criminal activity that were leaked to
reporters by government officials were “records”); Scarborough v. Harvey,
493 F. Supp. 2d 1, 15-16 (D.D.C. 2007) (asserting documents naming
individual plaintiffs and describing their involvement in allegedly criminal
activities were “about” plaintiffs and therefore were not excluded from
definition of “records,” even if these activities were undertaken in
connection with plaintiffs’ businesses); Leighton v. CIA, 412 F. Supp. 2d 30,
38-39 (D.D.C. 2006) (finding information included in magazine column,
which did not name plaintiff contractor or contain identifier but stated that
“the CIA is looking at contractors and suspended two in June for talking to

document “may well be ‘about’ the author,” after in camera review, as it
discussed author’s family status, employment, and fear of physical
retaliation if letter were disclosed to plaintiff, and ultimately ruling that it
need not reach issue of whether or not letter was “about” author and

disposition of plaintiff’s merchandise “lacks a sufficient informational nexus
with [plaintiff] (himself, as opposed to his property) to bring it within the
definition of ‘record’”).
Agreeing with Tobey, the Fifth Circuit concluded that information must be
both “about” an individual and contain an identifying particular assigned to
that individual to qualify as a “record.” See Pierce, 512 F.3d at 188. In
Pierce, the Fifth Circuit explained that “[a]lthough the Privacy Act protects
more than just documents that contain a person’s name, it does not protect
documents that do not include identifying particulars.” Id. at 187. In
determining whether a “final response letter” and “summary report of
investigation” containing only “duty titles” constituted “records,” the court
concluded that, because duty titles did “not pertain to one and only one
individual,” they did not qualify as “identifying particulars” and thus, did
not qualify as records under Privacy Act. Id. at 187-88. However, the court
also recognized that “where duty titles pertain to one and only one
individual . . . duty titles may indeed be ‘identifying particulars’ as that term
is used in the definition of ‘record’ in the Privacy Act.” Id.
Additional courts have adopted different, narrow, and, at times, conflicting
interpretations of the term “record.”
Several other courts have limited Privacy Act coverage by applying narrow
constructions of the term “record” without explicitly adopting the Ninth
and Eleventh Circuits’ requirement that information must reflect some
characteristic of the individual involved. See, e.g., Minshew v. Donley, 911
F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1071 (D. Nev. 2012) (finding that emails revealing
information about plaintiff were “the method of disclosure, not the source of
the Privacy Act protected material” and, thus, the emails themselves were
not “records”); Counce v. Nicholson, No. 3:06cv00171, 2007 WL 1191013, at
*15 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 18, 2007) (concluding that “email contain[ing]

reflective of some quality or characteristic of an individual”).
For a further illustration of conflicting views concerning the meaning of the
term “record” in the context of individuals’ right to access their records
under subsection (d)(1), compare Voelker v. IRS, 646 F.2d 332, 334 (8th Cir.
1981) (requiring agency to provide individual with access to his entire
record, even though some information in that record “pertained” to a third
party), with Sussman, 494 F.3d at 1121 n.9 (interpreting subsection (d)(1) “to
give parties access only to their own records, not to all information
pertaining to them that happens to be contained in a system of records”;
“[f]or an assemblage of data to qualify as one of [plaintiff’s] records, it must
not only contain his name or other identifying particulars but also be about
him”). See also Aguirre v. SEC, 671 F. Supp. 2d 113, 121 (D.D.C. 2009),

685, 693-98 (W.D. Mich. 1982). These important cases are discussed further
below under “Individual’s Right of Access.”
One district court, in a case concerning the Privacy Act’s subsection (b)(3)
routine use exception, held that a plaintiff may choose which particular
“item of information,” i.e., one document, contained within a “collection or
grouping of information” to designate as a “record” and challenge as
wrongfully disclosed. Covert v. Harrington, 667 F. Supp. 730, 736-37 (E.D.
Wash. 1987), aff’d on other grounds, 876 F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1989). Purporting
to construe the term “record” narrowly, the district court in Covert ruled
that the Department of Energy’s routine use permitting disclosure of

relevant records where “a record” indicates a potential violation of law did
not permit its Inspector General to disclose personnel security
questionnaires to the Justice Department for prosecution because the
questionnaires themselves did not reveal a potential violation of law on
their face. 667 F. Supp. at 736-37. Covert is discussed further below under
“Conditions of Disclosure to Third Parties,” “Agency Requirements,” and
“Civil Remedies.”
Private notes are not “records,” but may become them once used to make a
determination about an individual.
Purely private notes – such as personal memory refreshers – generally are
found not to be subject to the Privacy Act because they are not “agency
records.” Bowyer v. Air Force, 804 F.2d 428, 431 (7th Cir. 1986); see also
Johnston v. Horne, 875 F.2d 1415, 1423 (9th Cir. 1989); Boyd, 709 F.2d at 686;

control or dominion (e.g., personal telephone lists) are not considered to be
agency records within the meaning of the Privacy Act.”); cf. System of

agency exercises no control [over] and does not require or specifically

retained or discarded at the author’s sole discretion, such notes are not

However, in Chapman v. NASA, 682 F.2d 526, 528-29 (5th Cir. 1982), the
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, relying on the fair recordkeeping
duties imposed by subsection (e)(5), ruled that private notes may
“evanesce” into records subject to the Act when they are used to make a
decision on the individual’s employment status well after the evaluation
period for which they were compiled. See also Thompson v. Coast Guard,
547 F. Supp. 274, 283-84 (S.D. Fla. 1982) (holding timeliness requirement of

“another person’s witnessing of a personal note converts it to a Level 2 –
Supervisor’s Personnel Record, and therefore it is properly maintained
under the Privacy Act” in a system of records in accordance with the agency
manual).
Publicly available information can be a “record.”
Publicly available information, such as newspaper clippings or press
releases, can constitute a “record.” See Clarkson v. IRS, 678 F.2d 1368, 137273 (11th Cir. 1982) (permitting subsection (e)(7) First Amendment challenge

One court has held that grand jury materials are not “records.”

Agencies are not required to create “records.”
The Privacy Act – like the FOIA – does not require agencies to create records
that do not exist. See DeBold v. Stimson, 735 F.2d 1037, 1041 (7th Cir. 1984);
see also, e.g., Villanueva v. DOJ, 782 F.2d 528, 532 (5th Cir. 1986) (rejecting
argument that the FBI was required to “find a way to provide a brief but
intelligible explanation for its decision . . . without [revealing exempt
information]”). But see May v. Air Force, 777 F.2d 1012, 1015-17 (5th Cir.
1985) (singularly ruling that “reasonable segregation requirement” obligates
agency to create and release typewritten version of handwritten evaluation
forms so as not to reveal identity of evaluator under exemption (k)(7)). For
further analysis of this principle, see the “Individual’s Right of Access”

5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5) - System of Records
“[T]he term ‘system of records’ means a group of any records under the control
of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual
or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned
to the individual.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5).
Comment:
To be a “system of records,” documents must be retrievable by, and agencies must
actually retrieve them by, a personal identifier.
The statutory definition of a “system of records” requires that: (1) “there is an
indexing or retrieval capability using identifying particulars built into the
system”; and (2) the agency “does, in fact, retrieve records about individuals by
reference to some personal identifier.” OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg.
28,948, 28,952 (July 9, 1975), https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75. The
OMB 1975 Guidelines state that the “is retrieved by” criterion “implies that the
grouping of records under the control of an agency is accessed by the agency by
use of a personal identifier; not merely that a capability or potential for retrieval
exists.” Id. (emphasis added).
By its very terms, the statute includes, as personal identifiers, items beyond the
most commonly used name and social security number. As the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit pointed out when considering a “photo file”:
[37]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Recall that a system of records is “a group of any records . . . from
which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by
some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular
assigned to the individual.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5) (emphasis added).
The term “record” includes “any item . . . about an individual . . .
that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other
identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or
voice print or a photograph.” Id. § 552a(a)(4) (emphasis added).
Under the Act’s plain language, then, a “system of records” may be
a group of any records retrieved by an identifying particular such as
a photograph. In other words, the personal identifier may be the
photograph itself.
Maydak v. United States, 363 F.3d 512, 519-20 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (remanding case to
district court to determine whether prisons’ compilation of photographs
constitutes system of records), on remand No. 1:97-cv-02199, slip op. at 2-4
(D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2006) (“Searching through a box or collection of unidentified

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also concluded that to
be a “system of records,” “it is not sufficient that an agency has the capability to
retrieve information indexed under a person’s name, but the agency must in fact
retrieve records in this way in order for a system of records to exist.” Henke v.
Commerce, 83 F.3d 1453, 1460 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see also Elec. Privacy Info.
Ctr. v. DHS, 653 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“Even if . . . the [agency] has the ability
to combine various sources of information and then to link names to the images
produced using [advanced imaging technology], [the petitioners’] Privacy Act
claim still fails because they offer no reason to believe the [agency] has in fact
done that.” (citing Henke)); Chang v. Navy, 314 F. Supp. 2d 35, 41 (D.D.C. 2004)
(“[A]n agency’s failure to acknowledge that it maintains a system of records will
not protect the agency from statutory consequences if there is evidence that the
agency in practice retrieves information about individuals by their names or
personal identifiers. . . . [H]owever, mere retrievability – that is, the capability to
retrieve – is not enough.”).
Generally, the “system of records” definition makes the method of retrieval of a record
more important than the content of the record.
The highly technical “system of records” definition is perhaps the single most
important Privacy Act concept, because (with some exceptions discussed below)
it makes coverage under the Act dependent upon the method of retrieval of a
record rather than its substantive content. See Baker v. Navy, 814 F.2d 1381, 1384
(9th Cir. 1987) (noting the “overwhelming support for using a record’s method of
retrievability to determine the scope of accessibility”); see also Burton v. Wolf,
803 F. App’x 120, 122 (9th Cir. 2020) (concluding that records were not in a
system of records under the Privacy Act because they were “retrievable only

own”); Kearns v. FAA, 312 F. Supp. 3d 97, 108 (D.D.C. 2018) (concluding that

(determining method of retrieval rather than substantive content controls

Indeed, a major criticism of the Privacy Act is that it can easily be circumvented
by not filing records in name-retrieved formats. See Privacy Commission
Report, at 503-04 n.7, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_ppsc. Recognizing
this potential for abuse, some courts have relaxed the “actual retrieval” standard
in particular cases (examples in cases cited below). Moreover, certain
subsections of the Privacy Act have been construed to apply even to records not

incorporated into a “system of records.” See “Definition” of “5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(a)(5) - System of Records” analysis below.
The agency, rather than those outside the agency, must be in the practice of retrieving
records by an identifying particular to meet the “system of records” definition.
Note also that the “practice of retrieval by name or other personal identifier must
be an agency practice to create a system of records and not a ‘practice’ by those
outside the agency.” McCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2006)
(holding that agency’s public website, which was not used by agency personnel
to retrieve information by personal identifier, did not constitute a “system of
records”). See also Yonemoto v. VA, No. 06-00378, 2007 WL 1310165, at *5-6 (D.
Haw. May 2, 2007) (“[I]t was not the agency, but the public who caused
[information contained in e-mails] to be retrieved. Just because an agency is
capable of retrieving the information, and just because it does so to comply with
a FOIA request, does not mean that the information is maintained in a Privacy
Act ‘system of records.’”), appeal dismissed as moot, 305 F. App’x 333 (9th Cir.
2008); Freeman v. EPA, No. 02-0387, 2004 WL 2451409, at *11-12 (D.D.C. Oct. 25,
2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (explaining that because agency’s
search for records pursuant to FOIA request “will normally trigger a search
beyond the narrow confines of a Privacy Act system of records,” it is not
conclusive as to whether any responsive records would be “retrieved by
[plaintiff’s] name or some other identifying particular assigned to the
individual”).
Retrievability, alone, is not enough to be part of a “system of records.”
Courts have held that retrievability alone is insufficient to satisfy the system of
records “retrieved by” requirement; the records must also be organized by
personally identifying information. See In re 2122 21st Rd. N. Arlington, No.
1:17–CR–00236, 2018 WL 534161, at *4 (E.D. Va. Jan. 23, 2018) (reasoning that
plaintiff failed to show that evidence seized during search conducted in criminal
investigation constituted records “contained in a system of records” under
Privacy Act); Lewis v. SSA, No. 9:14-CV-31, 2015 WL 9664967, at *5 (E.D. Tex.
Dec. 7, 2015) (magistrate’s recommendation) (allowing case to proceed because
pleadings did not rule out possibility that SSA had retrieved information by
plaintiff’s name or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying
particular), adopted, 2016 WL 81577 (E.D. Tex. Jan 06, 2016); Walia v. Holder, 59

(“Since the WISE database is essentially a database of e-mail messages, some of
which are messages containing ‘open source media articles,’ . . . it is logical that
such messages would not be organized by the name or personal identifying
information of individuals discussed in such articles, and [plaintiff] has offered
no evidence to contradict this explanation”); York v. McHugh, 850 F. Supp. 2d
305, 306, 314-315 (D.D.C. 2012) (holding where agency stored electronic
documents containing plaintiff’s medical information in “shared network drive”
accessible to other employees, shared drive did not constitute system of records
even though this method of storage “allowed [plaintiff] to discover the files by
searching the shared . . . drive for [her name]”; “The fact that some documents
were labeled with [plaintiff’s] name does not convert the shared . . . drive into a
system of records, particularly where there is no evidence that the agency used
the shared drive to retrieve the personal information by personal identifiers and
the drive was not created for employees to do so.”); Krieger, 529 F. Supp. 2d at
42-44, 45-46 (finding that plaintiff “offers no facts suggesting that [emails] would
have been indexed by name, or that an electronic folder existed that grouped
emails related to him by name or other identifier” and noting that “a search
function does not [make it] a system of records”); Chang, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 41
(applying Henke and stating that “[p]laintiff’s assertion that it is ‘technically
possible’ to retrieve the [document] by searching for [plaintiff’s] name is
insufficient to meet the requirement that the data was retrieved in such a
manner”); Fisher v. NIH, 934 F. Supp. 464, 472-73 (D.D.C. 1996) (applying Henke
and stating: “[T]he primary practice and policy of the agency [during the time of
the alleged disclosures] was to index and retrieve the investigatory files by the
name of the institution in which the alleged misconduct occurred, rather than by
the name of the individual scientist accused of committing the misconduct. The
fact that it was possible to use the plaintiff’s name to identify a file containing
information about the plaintiff is irrelevant.”), summary affirmance granted, No.
96-5252, 1996 WL 734079 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 27, 1996); Beckette v. USPS, No. 88-802,
slip op. at 19-22 (E.D. Va. July 3, 1989) (finding that even though the agency
“could retrieve . . . records by way of an individual’s name or other personal
identifier,” that fact “does not make those records a Privacy Act system of
records. The relevant inquiry is whether the records or the information they
contain are [in fact] retrieved by name or other personal identifier.”).
Indeed, the issue in Henke was whether or not computerized databases that
contained information concerning technology grant proposals submitted by
businesses constituted a “system of records” as to individuals listed as the
“contact persons” for the grant applications, where the agency had
acknowledged that “it could theoretically retrieve information by the name of
the contact person.” Id. at 1457-58. The D.C. Circuit looked to Congress’s use of
[42]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

the words “is retrieved” in the statute’s definition of a system of records and
focused on whether the agency “in practice” retrieved information. Id. at 145961. The court held that “in determining whether an agency maintains a system
of records keyed to individuals, the court should view the entirety of the
situation, including the agency’s function, the purpose for which the information
was gathered, and the agency’s actual retrieval practice and policies.” Id. at
1461. Regarding the purpose for which the information was gathered, the court
drew a distinction between information gathered for investigatory purposes and
information gathered for administrative purposes. Id. at 1461. The court stated
that where information is compiled about individuals “primarily for
investigatory purposes, Privacy Act concerns are at their zenith, and if there is
evidence of even a few retrievals of information keyed to individuals’ names, it
may well be the case that the agency is maintaining a system of records.” Id.
Applying this test, the D.C. Circuit determined that the agency did “not maintain
a system of records keyed to individuals listed in the contact person fields of its
databases” because the agency’s “purpose in requesting the name of a technical
contact [was] essentially administrative and [was] not even necessary for the
conduct of the [program’s] operations,” nor was there “any evidence that the
names of contact persons [were] used regularly or even frequently to obtain
information about those persons.” Id. at 1456, 1461-62.
Several courts have followed Henke insofar as it calls on them to “view the
entirety of the situation, including the agency’s function, the purpose for which
the information was gathered, and the agency’s actual retrieval practice and
policies” in determining “whether an agency maintains a system of records
keyed to individuals.” Id. at 1461. See Maydak, 363 F.3d at 520 (quoting Henke,
remanding case to district court to determine whether prisons’ compilation of
photographs constituted system of records, and instructing district court to “take
into account ‘the entirety of the situation, including the agency’s function, the
purpose for which the information was gathered, and the agency’s actual
retrieval practices and policies’”); Pippinger v. Rubin, 129 F.3d 519, 526-27 (10th
Cir. 1997) (finding approach in Henke “instructive” and holding that under “a
properly ‘narrow’ construction of 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5),” an IRS database
containing an “abstraction” of information from two existing Privacy Act
systems did not constitute new system of records because it could be “accessed
only by the same users, and only for the same purposes, as those published in
the Federal Register for the original ‘system[s] of records’”); Sussman v.
Marshals Serv., 657 F. Supp. 2d 25, 27-28 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Given the function of
the Marshals Service, Privacy Act concerns are at their zenith . . . [T]he Marshals

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Systems of Records and Disclosures under Subsection (b)
Retrieved from System of Records
A record is “disclosed” under the Privacy Act only if it is retrieved from a system
of records.
Subsection 552a(b), discussed in detail below under “Conditions of
Disclosure to Third Parties,” prohibits only the disclosure of records that
are retrieved from a system of records. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5), (b); see also,
e.g., Paige v. DEA, 665 F.3d 1355, 1359-61 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (concluding that
disclosure of video excerpted from longer video did not violate Privacy
Act because video was not retrievable by appellant’s name or other
personal identifier at time it was created and, therefore, was not record
contained in system of records; “disclosure of [excerpted video] was not
prohibited simply because [it] subsequently became a ‘record which is
contained in a system of records’); Doe v. VA, 519 F.3d 456 (8th Cir. 2008)
(finding Congress intended to limit liability for disclosures to a record
“contained in a system of records”); Harris v. Holder, 885 F. Supp. 2d 390,
401 (D.D.C. 2012) (finding plaintiff’s complaint failed to state how an
offending record with respect to an investigation was “about” plaintiff or
was retrieved by plaintiff’s name or other personal identifier); White v.
Schafer, 738 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1139-40 (D. Colo. 2010) (holding plaintiff,
who claimed that agency disclosed investigatory report in violation of
subsection (b), failed to present evidence that report “was maintained
within and retrieved from a ‘system of records’”), aff’d, 435 F. App’x 764
(10th Cir. 2011); Bechhoefer v. DOJ, 179 F. Supp. 2d 93, 95-101 (W.D.N.Y.
2001) (finding that disclosed record “never became a part of a system of
records” where DEA agent “stuck [record] in his desk drawer along with
a number o[f] other miscellaneous documents, and later retrieved it from
that drawer, from his own memory and personal knowledge of where he
kept it”; and noting that plaintiff’s allegation that agent looked at
plaintiff’s name on record to retrieve it from drawer “confuses retrieving a
document with identifying the document”; “If one is looking for a letter
from a particular person, one will probably look at the name on the letter
in order to identify it as the letter being sought. If that letter is in a stack of
unrelated, miscellaneous documents, however, it cannot be said to be
contained within a group of records organized in such a fashion that
information can be retrieved by an individual’s name.”), aff’d, 312 F.3d
563, 567-68 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2002) (concluding that an “assortment of papers

was intercepted in conformity with BOP regulations). But see Wall v. IRS,
No. 1:88-CV-1942, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9427, at *4-7 (N.D. Ga. July 5,
1989) (explaining that because agency official retrieved applicant’s folder
by name from file maintained under vacancy announcement number,
records were kept within “system of records” and thus subsection (b) was
applicable).
Similarly, the disclosure of information “acquired from non-record
sources – such as observation, office emails, discussions with co-workers
and the ‘rumor mill’– does not violate the Privacy Act ... even if the
information disclosed is also contained in agency records.” Dick v.
Holder, 67 F. Supp. 3d 167, 180 (D.D.C. 2014), citing Cloonan v. Holder,

Plaintiff’s physical altercation . . . and would have known about any

identical information may be contained in an agency system of records”).
Several courts have stated that the first element a plaintiff must prove in a
wrongful disclosure suit is that the information disclosed is a record
within a system of records. See Jacobs v. Nat’l Drug Intel. Ctr., 423 F.3d
512, 516 (5th Cir. 2005); Davis v. Runyon, No. 96-4400, 1998 WL 96558, at

wrongful disclosure claim pursuant to the Privacy Act where appellant’s
factual allegations failed to indicate whether “‘information’ was a ‘record’

meaning of the Act,” whether disclosure had “adverse effect,” or whether
disclosure was “willful or intentional”); Quinn v. Stone, 978 F.2d 126, 131

retrieval [wa]s purely circumstantial” and noting “plaintiffs can rarely
produce direct evidence that the government has disclosed confidential
information obtained from their private records, requiring such evidence
would eviscerate the protections of the Privacy Act”).
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has gone so far as to hold that a
complaint that fails to allege a disclosure from a system of records is
facially deficient, and some district courts in other jurisdictions have taken
the same approach. Beaulieu v. IRS, 865 F.2d 1351, 1352 (1st Cir. 1989); see
also Cross v. Potter, No. 3:09-CV-1293, 2013 WL 1149525, at *10 (N.D.N.Y.
Mar. 19, 2013); Zahedi v. DOJ, No. 10-694, 2011 WL 1872206, at *4 (D. Or.
May 16, 2011); Del Fuoco v. O’Neill, No. 8:09-CV-1262, 2011 WL 601645,
at *9-10 & n.13 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 11, 2011) (finding plaintiff’s complaint
insufficient because he failed to properly allege his record was from
system of records even though DOJ stamped the record as confidential
which implied DOJ considered record protected by Privacy Act); Thomas
v. USPS, No. 3:10-CV-1091, slip op. at 7-8 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 3, 2010);
Mumme v. Labor, 150 F. Supp. 2d 162, 175 (D. Me. 2001), aff’d, No. 012256 (1st Cir. June 12, 2002).
However, other courts have not held pleadings in Privacy Act cases to the
same strict standard. The D.C. Circuit, for example, concluded that a
plaintiff need not identify the particular records that were improperly
disclosed because the complaint properly put the government on notice
and alleged the essential elements of his claim, by alleging that “records
concerning [himself] were wrongfully disclosed.” Krieger v. Fadely, 211
F.3d 134, 136-37 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“If his lawsuit went forward, there
would come a time when [plaintiff] would have to identify the particular
records [defendant] unlawfully disclosed. But that point surely was not
as early as the pleading stage.”); see also Feldman, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 41
(explaining that circuit court case law did not require plaintiff to allege
full details of disclosure at pleading stage, noting “in the typical case, a
plaintiff can hardly be expected to know the full details behind an
improper disclosure prior to discovery, since those details are most likely
to be under the control of the defendant”); Tripp v. DOD, 193 F. Supp. 2d
229, 237 (D.D.C. 2002) (following Krieger and “the liberal pleading
standard permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure”); Tripp v.
DOD, 219 F. Supp. 2d 85, 89-91 (D.D.C. 2002) (considering complaint that
alleged “specific defendant repeatedly released information about
plaintiff to the press and public that is contained in a Privacy Act system

of records, including but not limited to the contents of plaintiff’s security
forms and other personnel files,” and following Krieger to hold that Rule
8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “does not require plaintiff to
plead facts to further elaborate which records were released, by which
DOD officials, to which members of the press or public, or on which
specific dates”); Johnson v. Rinaldi, No. 1:99CV170, 2001 WL 677306, at *56 (M.D.N.C. Apr. 13, 2001) (stating that “Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
require only that the complaint put Defendants on notice” and that
plaintiff “need not use the exact words ‘record’ or ‘system of records’ or
state facts sufficient to show that the documents in dispute meet those
legal definitions”); cf. Wade v. Donahoe, Nos. 11-3795, 11-4584, 2012 WL
3844380, at *10 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 4, 2012) (finding that plaintiffs must identify
Privacy Act provision agency violated in order to meet pleading
requirements of Rule 8 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); Sterling v.
United States, 798 F. Supp. 47, 49 (D.D.C. 1992) (“[P]laintiff is not barred
from stating a claim for monetary damages [under (g)(1)(D)] merely
because the record did not contain ‘personal information’ about him and
was not retrieved through a search of indices bearing his name or other
identifying characteristics.”), subsequent related opinion, Sterling v.
United States, 826 F. Supp. 570, 571-72 (D.D.C. 1993), summary affirmance
granted, No. 93-5264, 1994 WL 88894 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 11, 1994).
It is not enough, however, for a plaintiff claiming that an agency disclosed
information in violation of subsection (b) to show that the information
was contained in any system of records maintained by the agency. See
Sussman v. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1123 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Rather,
the plaintiff “must show [that] the [agency] improperly disclosed
materials located in records retrievable by [the plaintiff’s] name as
opposed to someone else’s name.” Id. The plaintiff in Sussman alleged
that the agency disclosed information about him in violation of subsection
(b). The Marshals Service did “not deny[] the materials were in a system
of records” but argued that “[t]he information was not maintained in a
system of records retrievable by [the plaintiff’s] name, but by [another
individual’s] name.” Id. Reasoning in part that it “must construe
§ 552a(g)(1)(D)’s waiver of sovereign immunity narrowly,” the D.C.
Circuit held that “for his action to survive, [the plaintiff] must present
evidence that materials from records about him, which the [agency]
retrieved by his name, were improperly disclosed.” Id.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Courts have held that information taken from a record in a system of records
remains protected, even if later incorporated into a record that is not maintained
in a system of records.
Furthermore, information taken from a protected record in a system of
records, but subsequently incorporated into a record that is not
maintained in a system of records, can nonetheless itself be deemed a
protected record. See e.g., Jacobs, 423 F.3d at 516-519 (ruling that
disclosure of executive summary, which was not retrieved by plaintiff’s
name but was created from information in system of records that was so
retrieved, was from system of records); see also Bartel v. FAA, 725 F.2d
1403, 1407-09 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (finding that letters that communicated
sensitive information contained in report of investigation, which was “a
record” maintained in “a system of records,” triggered disclosure
provisions of the Privacy Act even though letters were not themselves
considered “records,” because “an absolute policy of limiting the Act’s
coverage to information physically retrieved from a record would make
little sense in terms of [Privacy Act’s] underlying purpose”); Chang v.
Navy, 314 F. Supp. 2d 35, 41 (D.D.C. 2004) (maintaining that, although it
was undisputed that documents at issue – press release and “information
paper” containing details of plaintiff’s non-judicial punishment – were not
retrieved from system of records, information from system of records had
been disclosed because “underlying documents, from which the
documents were compiled, were contained in a system of records”).
Similarly, the First Circuit held that “the unauthorized disclosure by one
agency of protected information obtained from a record in another
agency’s system is a prohibited disclosure under the Act, unless the
disclosure falls within the statutory exceptions.” Orekoya v. Mooney, 330
F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2003), abrogated on other grounds, Doe v. Chao, 540
U.S. 614 (2004); Doe v. Treasury, 706 F. Supp. 2d at 6 (“[T]he Privacy Act
only covers disclosures of information which was either directly or
indirectly retrieved from a system of records.” (quoting Fisher v. NIH, 934
F. Supp. 464, 473 (D.D.C. 1996))). In Orekoya, the First Circuit, although
ultimately affirming the district court on other grounds, disagreed with
the district court’s determination that such a disclosure was not a
violation of the Privacy Act and stated that the language of the Privacy
Act “does not support the view that an agency may immunize itself from
liability by obtaining information from a different agency’s system of
records and then saying its further unauthorized disclosure is protected
because its own system of records was not the original source.” Id.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Actual Retrieval
Generally, a “disclosure” requires that the record be actually retrieved from a
system of records; a disclosure made on the basis of knowledge acquired
independent of actual retrieval from an agency’s system of records is not enough,
even when the information happens to be in a system of records.
Although subsection (b) “does not specifically require that the
information disclosed be retrieved directly from” a record contained in a
system of records, “courts generally apply some type of retrieval
requirement to give effect to the meaning and purpose of the Privacy
Act.” Doe v. VA, 519 F.3d at 464 (Hansen, J., concurring); see also, e.g.,
Armstrong v. Geithner, 608 F.3d 854, 857 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“To be
actionable . . . a disclosure generally must be the result of someone having
actually retrieved the ‘record’ from th[e] ‘system of records’; the
disclosure of information is not ordinarily a violation ‘merely because the
information happens to be contained in the records.’” (quoting Bartel v.
FAA, 725 F.2d at 1408))); Doe v. VA, 519 F.3d at 461 (“[T]he only
disclosure actionable under section 552a(b) is one resulting from a
retrieval of the information initially and directly from the record
contained in the system of records.” (quoting Olberding v. DOD, 709 F.2d
621, 622 (8th Cir. 1983))); Cloonan, 768 F. Supp. 2d at 164 (“[D]efinition [of
‘system of records’] – which incorporates the requirement that
information ‘is retrieved’ – has given rise to the so-called ‘retrieval rule’
under the Privacy Act”). Thus, it has frequently been held that subsection
(b) is not violated when a disclosure is made on the basis of knowledge
acquired independent of actual retrieval from an agency’s system of
records (such as a disclosure purely from memory), regardless of whether
the identical information also happens to be contained in the agency’s
systems of records.
The leading case articulating the “actual retrieval” and “independent
knowledge” concepts is Savarese v. HEW, 479 F. Supp. 304, 308 (N.D. Ga.
1979), aff’d, 620 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1980) (unpublished table decision), in
which the court ruled that for a disclosure to be covered by subsection (b),
“there must have initially been a retrieval from the system of records
which was at some point a source of the information.” 479 F. Supp. at 308.
In adopting this stringent “actual retrieval” test, the court in Savarese
reasoned that a more relaxed rule could result in excessive governmental
liability, or an unworkable requirement that agency employees “have a
pansophic recall concerning every record within every system of records
within the agency.” Id.

In most courts, the “actual retrieval” requirement does not apply if the agency
official disclosing the record also had a role in creating the record.
However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in
Bartel v. FAA, 725 F.2d 1403 (D.C. Cir. 1984), held that the “actual
retrieval” standard is inapplicable where a disclosure is undertaken by
agency personnel who had a role in creating the record that contains the
released information. In other words, the “independent knowledge”
defense is not available to agency personnel who were involved in
creating the record. Id. at 1408-11. This particular aspect of Bartel has
been noted with approval by several other courts. See Manuel, 857 F.2d at
1120 & n.1; Minshew, 911 F. Supp. 2d at 1072 (finding that “source of the

by the D.C. Circuit in Bartel, and also concluded that the “actual retrieval”
standard is inapplicable where a disclosure is undertaken by agency
personnel who had a role in creating the record that contains the released
information. Wilborn v. HHS, 49 F.3d 597, 600-02 (9th Cir. 1995).
[55]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Specifically, the court held that an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) for
the Department of Health and Human Services violated the Privacy Act
when he stated in an opinion that one of the parties’ attorneys had been
placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (“PIP”) while he was
employed at HHS – despite the fact that there was no actual retrieval by
the ALJ – because, as the creator of the PIP, the ALJ had personal
knowledge of the matter. The Ninth Circuit noted the similarity of the
facts to those of Bartel and held that “‘independent knowledge,’ gained by
the creation of records, cannot be used to sidestep the Privacy Act.” Id. at
601. Additionally, it rejected the lower court’s reasoning that not only
was there no retrieval, but there was no longer a record capable of being
retrieved because as the result of a grievance action, all records relating to
the PIP had been required to be expunged from the agency’s records and
in fact were expunged by the ALJ himself. Id. at 601-02. The Ninth
Circuit found the district court’s ruling “inconsistent with the spirit of the
Privacy Act,” and stated that the “fact that the agency ordered
expungement of all information relating to the PIP makes the ALJ’s
disclosure, if anything, more rather than less objectionable.” Id. at 602.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, however, has twice taken a
narrow view of the “actual retrieval” standard. In a per curiam decision
in Olberding v. DOD, 709 F.2d 621 (8th Cir. 1983), the court ruled that
information orally disclosed by a military psychiatrist to the plaintiff’s
commanding general, revealing the results of the plaintiff’s examination –
which had not yet been put in writing – was not retrieved from a
“record.” Id. at 621 (adopting reasoning of trial court, which found that
the conversation took place before the report was written, 564 F. Supp.
907, 910 (S.D. Iowa 1982)). Subsequently, in Doe v. VA, the court ruled
that there was no actual retrieval from a record where a VA physician
revealed an employee’s HIV status and marijuana use to a union
representative because the physician recalled the information exclusively
from discussions during employee’s medical appointments, not from any
subsequent review of his medical notes. 519 F.3d at 459-62. Although the
court purported to distinguish Bartel and Wilborn, id. at 462-63, Judge
Hanson stated in his concurring opinion that were he not bound by
Olberding, he would adopt a “scrivener’s exception” in order to “justify
an exception to the general retrieval rule, particularly where ‘a mechanical
application of the rule would thwart, rather than advance, the purpose of
the Privacy Act.’” Id. at 464-65 (quoting Wilborn, 49 F.3d at 600).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Systems of Records and Access and Amendment under Subsections (d)(1)
and (d)(2)
One of Congress’s underlying concerns in narrowly defining a “system of
records” appears to have been efficiency – i.e., a concern that any broader
definition would require elaborate cross-references among records and/or
burdensome hand-searches for records. See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed.
Reg. at 28,957, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75. As the Fifth
Circuit has stated, the “system of records” requirement “reflects a statutory
compromise between affording individuals access to those records relating
directly to them and protecting federal agencies from the burdensome task
of searching through agency records for mere mention of an individual’s
name.” Bettersworth v. FDIC, 248 F.3d 386, 391 (5th Cir. 2001); see also
Baker v. Navy, 814 F.2d 1381, 1385 (9th Cir. 1987); Carpenter v. IRS, 938 F.
Supp. 521, 522-23 (S.D. Ind. 1996).
If a record is not retrieved by a personal identifier, it is not part of a “system of
records” and the Privacy Act’s access and amendment provisions generally do not
apply.
Consistent with OMB’s guidance, numerous courts have held that, under
subsection (d)(1), an individual has no Privacy Act right of access to his
record if it is not retrieved by his name or personal identifier. See Mobley v.
CIA, 806 F.3d 568, 587 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (concluding plaintiff was not entitled
to documents where agency official claimed that it did not organize records
“by individuals who may be mentioned in those records,” or “retrieve
records about individuals from that database by use of an individual’s name
or personal identifier as a matter of practice.”); Bettersworth v. FDIC, 248

gov/paoverview_omb-75.
Likewise, with regard to amendment under subsection (d)(2), several courts
have ruled that where an individual’s record is being maintained allegedly
in violation of subsection (e)(1) or (e)(5), the individual has no Privacy Act
right to amend his record under subsection (d)(2), if it is not retrieved by his
name or personal identifier. See, e.g., Baker, 814 F.2d at 1384-85 (“the scope
of accessibility and the scope of amendment are coextensive”); Clarkson v.
IRS, 678 F.2d 1368, 1376-77 (11th Cir. 1982) (maintaining that although
subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) apply only to records contained in a system of
records, “find[ing] it both necessary and appropriate to construe the plain
meaning of the language of subsections (d)(2) and (d)(3) to authorize the
amendment or expungement of all records which are maintained in
violation of subsection (e)(7)”); Seldowitz v. OIG of State, No. 99-1031, slip

The D.C. Circuit, however, has recognized that “[t]he Privacy Act also offers
relief for some claims based on the government’s information that is not
‘within a system of records,’” including “misstatements contained in a
disparaging Inspector General’s report and associated agency documents”
and “when an ‘adverse determination is made’ by the agency that
maintained the flawed record or by an outside actor.” Liff v. OIG for Labor,

see also Gerlich v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 161, 169 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (noting that “[t]he
obligations the Privacy Act established in subsection (e)(5) . . . apply even
when the agency does not maintain the records at issue in its system of
records”); McCready, 465 F.3d at 10-12 (holding that subsection (g)(1)(C),
the civil remedy provision for violations of subsection (e)(5), “applies to any
record, and not [just] any record within a system of records” (internal
quotation marks omitted)), discussed, below, under “Protections for Records
[58]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

not within a System of Records.”
With regards to the Privacy Act’s access and amendment provisions, courts have
generally not permitted agencies to purposefully file records in an effort to evade
retrieving by individual identifier.
However, with respect to access under subsection (d)(1), and amendment
under subsection (d)(2), some courts have cautioned that an agency’s
purposeful filing of records in a non-name-retrieved format, in order to
evade those provisions, will not be permitted. See, e.g., Pototsky v. Navy,
No. 89-1891, slip op. at 2 (1st Cir. Apr. 3, 1990) (per curiam); Manuel, 857
F.2d at 1120 (“The Court does not want to give a signal to federal agencies
that they should evade their responsibility to place records within their
‘system of records’ in violation of the [Act].”); Baker, 814 F.2d at 1385;
Kalmin v. Navy, 605 F. Supp. 1492, 1495 n.5 (D.D.C. 1985).
Several, but not all, courts have required agencies to keep adverse action records in a
system of records, and therefore subject to the Privacy Act’s access and amendment
provisions.
Following the rationale of the Fifth Circuit in Chapman v. NASA, 682 F.2d
526, 529 (5th Cir. 1982), several courts have recognized a subsection (e)(5)
duty to incorporate records into a system of records – thus making them
subject to access and amendment – where such records are used by the
agency in taking an adverse action against the individual. See MacDonald
v. VA, No. 87-544-CIV-T-15A, slip op. at 2-5 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 8, 1988);
Lawrence v. Dole, No. 83-2876, slip op. at 5-6 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 1985);
Waldrop v. Air Force, 3 Gov’t Disclosure Serv. (P-H) ¶ 83,016, at 83,453 (S.D.
Ill. Aug. 5, 1981); Nelson v. EEOC, No. 83-C-983, slip op. at 6-11 (E.D. Wis.
Feb. 14, 1984); cf. Manuel, 857 F.2d at 1117-19 (asserting that there is no duty
to place records within system of records where records “are not part of an
official agency investigation into activities of the individual requesting the
records, and where the records requested do not have an adverse effect on
the individual”).
The D.C. Circuit, however, interpreted the rule differently in an unusual
situation, i.e., where the agency’s regulations exempted such documents
from its records. See Horowitz v. Peace Corps, 428 F.3d. 271, 280-81 (D.C.
Cir. 2005). In Horowitz, the court denied the plaintiff access to a draft
Administrative Separation Report (“ASR”) that was not in a “system of
records” where the “Peace Corps’s regulations dictate that an ASR should
not be maintained in the agency’s records if a volunteer resigns prior to an
[59]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

official decision to administratively separate him.” Because “the Peace
Corps’s manual states that an ASR should not even be completed if a
volunteer resigns before such a decision is made” and plaintiff “resigned
before any final decision was made, the report was never completed and
pursuant to the procedure specified by the manual was not maintained in
the Peace Corps’s official files.” In addition, the court held that the plaintiff
had not shown that the agency “nevertheless placed the draft ASR in a
‘system of records’” because the draft ASR was stored in Peace Corps’s
Country Director’s safe and plaintiff “has not shown that files in the safe are,
in practice, retrieved by individuals’ names.” See also Gowan v. Air Force,
No. 90-94, slip op. at 7, 11, 13, 16, 30, 33 (D.N.M. Sept. 1, 1995) (finding
access claim moot, “personal notes and legal research” in file “marked
‘Ethics’” that were originally kept in desk of Deputy Staff Judge Advocate
but that was later given to Criminal Military Justice Section and used in
connection with court martial hearing were not in system of records for
purposes of either Privacy Act access or accuracy lawsuit for damages),
aff’d, 148 F.3d 1182, 1191 (10th Cir. 1998) (concluding that “the word ‘Ethics’
was not a personal identifier” and stating that it did “not find the district
court’s rulings regarding those documents to be clearly erroneous”).
3.

Protections for Records Not Within a System of Records
The “system of records” threshold requirement is not a requirement for the
application of all subsections of the Act. See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed.
Reg. at 28,952, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (system of
records definition “limits the applicability of some of the provisions of the
Act”) (emphasis added). But see Privacy Commission Report, at 503-04,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_ppsc (assuming that definition limits
entire Act); cf. Henke v. Commerce, 83 F.3d 1453, 1459 (D.C. Cir. 1996)
(“[T]he determination that a system of records exists triggers virtually all of
the other substantive provisions of the Privacy Act.”); McCready v. Principi,
297 F. Supp. 2d 178, 185 (D.D.C. 2003) (“For almost all circumstances, the
Act extends only to those records that are in a ‘system of records’ which is a
specific term of art.”), aff’d in part & rev’d in part sub nom. McCready v.
Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2006)., 465 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2006).
Records describing how individuals exercise First Amendment rights are protected
under the Privacy Act, even if not maintained in a system of records.
Importantly, the D.C. Circuit has held that subsection (e)(7) – which restricts
agencies from maintaining records describing how an individual exercises
his First Amendment rights – applies even to records not incorporated into a
[60]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

system of records. Albright v. United States, 631 F.2d 915, 918-20 (D.C. Cir.
1980). Albright involved a challenge on subsection (e)(7) grounds to an
agency’s maintenance of a videotape – kept in a file cabinet in an envelope
that was not labeled by any individual’s name – of a meeting between a
personnel officer and agency employees affected by the officer’s job
reclassification decision. Id. at 918. Relying on both the broad definition of
“maintain,” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(3), and the “special and sensitive treatment
accorded First Amendment rights,” the D.C. Circuit held that the mere
collection of a record regarding those rights could be a violation of
subsection (e)(7), regardless of whether the record was contained in a
system of records retrieved by an individual’s name or personal identifier.
Id. at 919-20; see also Maydak v. United States, 363 F.3d 512, 516, 518-19
(D.C. Cir. 2004) (reaffirming holding in Albright).
Albright’s broad construction of subsection (e)(7) has been adopted by
several other courts. See MacPherson v. IRS, 803 F.2d 479, 481 (9th Cir.
1986); Boyd v. Sec’y of Navy, 709 F.2d 684, 687 (11th Cir. 1983); Clarkson v.
IRS, 678 F.2d 1373, 1373-77 (11th Cir. 1982); Gerlich v. DOJ, 659 F. Supp. 2d
1, 13-15 (D.D.C. 2009), aff’d in part, rev’d in part & remanded, on other
grounds, 711 F.3d 161 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Fagot v. FDIC, 584 F. Supp. 1168,
1175 (D.P.R. 1984). Further, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in
Clarkson, held that, at least with respect to alleged violations of subsection
(e)(7), the Act’s amendment provision (subsection (d)(2)) also can apply to a
record not incorporated into a system of records. Clarkson, 678 F.2d at 137577. However, Judge Tjoflat’s concurring opinion in Clarkson intimated that
something more than a bare allegation of a subsection (e)(7) violation would
be necessary in order for an agency to be obligated to search beyond its
systems of records for potentially offensive materials. Id. at 1378-79.
The D.C. Circuit also held that the “system of records” requirement does not apply
in subsection (g)(1)(C) lawsuits challenging the accuracy of records.
In McCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 10-12 (D.C. Cir. 2006), the D.C. Circuit
went even further and held that the terms of subsection (g)(1)(C) – the
judicial remedy provision for subsection (e)(5) violations – “[do] not
incorporate or otherwise refer to the Act’s definition of a ‘system of records’
found in § 552a(a)(5).” The D.C. Circuit stated that the “distinction between
a claim that requires a system of records and a claim under § 552a(g)(1)(C)
that does not require a system of records makes perfect sense.” Id. Unlike
other types of Privacy Act claims, which are shielded by the system of
records definition in order to avoid “costly fishing expeditions,” the D.C.
Circuit reasoned, subsection (g)(1)(C) claims do not implicate “[t]his
[61]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

legitimate concern with preserving an agency’s resources” because “an
individual and an agency already have identified the record at issue, that
record is therefore easily retrieved, and the only issue is the accuracy of the
record.” Id. See also Gerlich, 659 F. Supp. 2d at 15-16 (relying on McCready
v. Nicholson to conclude that the system of records requirement did not
apply to plaintiffs’ claim under subsections (e)(5) and (g)(1)(C)), aff’d in
part, rev’d in part & remanded, on other grounds, 711 F.3d 161 (D.C. Cir.
2013).
Courts have varied on the extent to which they would extend coverage of other
Privacy Act provisions to records that are not maintained in a system of records.
Some district courts have similarly extended the coverage of other Privacy
Act provisions to records that are not maintained in a system of records. See
Connelly v. Comptroller of the Currency, 673 F. Supp. 1419, 1424 (S.D. Tex.
1987) (construing “any record” language contained in 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(1)(C) to permit a damages action arising from an allegedly
inaccurate record that was not incorporated into a system of records), rev’d
on other grounds, 876 F.2d 1209 (5th Cir. 1989); Reuber v. United States, No.
81-1857, slip op. at 5 (D.D.C. Oct. 27, 1982) (relying on Albright for
proposition that subsections (d)(2), (e)(1)-(2), (e)(5)-(7), and (e)(10) all apply
to a record not incorporated into a system of records), partial summary
judgment denied (D.D.C. Aug. 15, 1983), partial summary judgment granted
(D.D.C. Apr. 13, 1984), subsequent decision (D.D.C. Sept. 6, 1984), aff’d on
other grounds, 829 F.2d 133 (D.C. Cir. 1987); cf. Fiorella v. HEW, 2 Gov’t
Disclosure Serv. (P-H) ¶ 81,363, at 81,946 n.1 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 9, 1981)
(noting that subsections (e)(5) and (e)(7) “are parallel in structure and would
seem to require the same statutory construction”).
However, the D.C. Circuit has declined to extend the holding in Albright to
certain other subsections of § 552a(e). See Maydak v. United States, 363 F.3d
512, 517-19 (D.C. Cir. 2004). In Maydak, the Court of Appeals held that in
accordance with OMB guidelines and regulations, the requirements
contained in subsections (e)(1), (2), (3), and (10) are “triggered only if the
records are actually incorporated into a system of records.” Id. The D.C.
Circuit explained that it reached a different conclusion as to subsection (e)(7)
in Albright because of “Congress’[s] own special concern for the protection
of First Amendment rights.” Id. at 518 (quoting Albright, 631 F.2d at 919).
The court stated that “at least in comparison to the other subsections at
issue, subsection 552a(e)(7) proves the exception rather than the rule.” Id. at
519. See also Augustus v. McHugh, 825 F. Supp. 2d 245, 257-260 (D.D.C.
2011) (rejecting claims alleging violations of subsections (e)(2), (e)(4), and

(e)(10), and Army regulations implementing (e)(3), because plaintiff failed to
show that records at issue were contained in system of records); Gerlich, 659
F. Supp. 2d at 16 (“[S]ubsections (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(6), (e)(9), and (e)(10) . . .
only apply to records that are contained within a ‘system of records.’”), aff’d
in part, rev’d in part & remanded, on other grounds, 711 F.3d 161 (D.C. Cir.
2013); Krieger v. DOJ, 529 F. Supp. 2d 29, 50-56 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding that
subsections (e)(1), (4), (6), (9), and (10) apply only to records contained in a
system of records); cf. Thompson v. State, No. 03-2227, 400 F. Supp. 1, 12
(D.D.C. 2005) (following Maydak and observing that “[i]t is not at all clear
that subsection (e)(2) applies where the requested information never
becomes part of [the] system”), aff’d, 210 F. App’x 5 (D.C. Cir. 2006).
Other courts have also declined to follow the D.C. Circuit’s Albright
decision and have limited the applicability of the Privacy Act requirements
that are contained in subsections other than (e)(7) to records that are
maintained in a system of records. See, e.g., Gowan v. Air Force, 148 F.3d
1182, 1192 (10th Cir. 1998) (holding that appellant “ha[d] no § 552a(e)(5)
cause of action” for maintenance of report that was not maintained in
system of records); Clarkson, 678 F.2d at 1377 (declining to extend Albright
rationale to subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5)); Bettersworth v. FDIC, No. A-97CA-624, slip op. at 10 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 1, 2000) (magistrate’s
recommendation) (recognizing holding in Connelly, but noting that both
subsections (d)(1) and (g)(1)(C) contain same “system of records” language,
and stating that court is “unpersuaded that Congress intended any other
meaning than what has previously been applied”), adopted, (W.D. Tex. Feb.
17, 2000), aff’d on other grounds, 248 F.3d 386 (5th Cir. 2001); Felsen v. HHS,
No. CCB-95-975, slip op. at 61-62, 65 (D. Md. Sept. 30, 1998) (granting
defendants summary judgment on alternative ground that subsection (e)(2)
is inapplicable to records not included in system of records); Barhorst v.
Marsh, 765 F. Supp. 995, 999-1000 (E.D. Mo. 1991) (dismissing, on alternative
grounds, Privacy Act claims under subsections (b), (e)(1)-(3), (e)(5)-(6), and
(e)(10) because of finding that information was not in system of records;
information was retrieved by job announcement number, not by name or
other identifying particular).
Albright and its progeny establish that the “system of records” limitation on
the scope of the Privacy Act is not uniformly applicable to all of the Act’s
subsections. As is apparent from the above discussion, there has been some
uncertainty about which particular subsections of the statute are limited to
records contained in a “system of records.”

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

CONDITIONS OF DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES
The general rule under the Privacy Act is that an agency cannot disclose a record
contained in a system of records unless the individual to whom the record pertains
gives prior written consent to the disclosure. There are twelve exceptions to this
general rule.
A. The “No Disclosure without Consent” Rule
“No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records
by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except
pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the
individual to whom the record pertains [subject to 12 exceptions].” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(b).
Comment:
Under the Privacy Act’s disclosure provision, agencies generally are prohibited from
disclosing records by any means of communication – written, oral, electronic, or
mechanical – without the written consent of the individual, subject to twelve exceptions.
Federal officials handling personal information are “bound by the Privacy Act
not to disclose any personal information and to take certain precautions to keep
personal information confidential.” Big Ridge, Inc. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health
Review Comm’n, 715 F.3d 631, 650 (7th Cir. 2013); see also, e.g., Navy, Navy
Exch., Naval Training Station, Naval Hosp. v. FLRA, 975 F.2d 348, 350 (7th Cir.
1992) (noting that “Privacy Act generally prohibits the federal government from
disclosing personal information about an individual without the individual’s
consent”).
A “disclosure” can be by any means of communication – written, oral, electronic,
or mechanical. See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,953, https://www.
justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75; Bartel v. FAA, 725 F.2d 1403, 1409 (D.C. Cir.
1984) (concluding that “an absolute policy of limiting the Act’s coverage to
information physically retrieved from a record would make little sense in terms
of its underlying purpose” and that Privacy Act “forbids nonconsensual
disclosure of records “by any means of communication”); see also, e.g., Speaker
v. HHS Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, 623 F.3d 1371, 1382 n.11 (11th Cir.
2010) (“Numerous courts have held that the Privacy Act protects against
improper oral disclosures.”); Jacobs v. Nat’l Drug Intelligence Ctr., 423 F.3d 512,
517-19 (5th Cir. 2005) (rejecting argument that “the [Privacy Act] only protects
against the disclosure of a physical document that is contained in a system of

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

records,” and holding that “damaging information . . . taken from a protected
record and inserted into a new document, which was then disclosed without the
plaintiff’s consent,” violated subsection (b) because “the new document is also a
protected record”); Orekoya v. Mooney, 330 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003) (“The
Privacy Act prohibits more than dissemination of records themselves, but also
‘nonconsensual disclosure of any information that has been retrieved from a
protected record’” (quoting Bartel v. FAA, 725 F.2d at 1408)); Boyd v. United
States, 932 F. Supp. 2d 830, 835 (S.D. Ohio 2013) (“[w]hile the term ‘disclosure’ is
not defined by the statute, it has been interpreted broadly”); Cloonan v. Holder,
768 F. Supp. 2d. 154, 163 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Bartel, 725 F.2d at 1408); Chang v.
Navy, 314 F. Supp. 2d 35, 41 n.2 (D.D.C. 2004) (citing Bartel, 725 F.2d at 1408).
OMB guidelines, and some, but not all, courts have advised that disclosures can occur by
either transferring a record or simply “granting access” to a record.
Further, a disclosure under the Privacy Act “may be either the transfer of a
record or the granting of access to a record.” OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg.
at 28953 (July 9, 1975), https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75; see also
Wilkerson v. Shinseki, 606 F.3d 1256, 1268 (10th Cir. 2010) (interpreting
disclosure under the Privacy Act “liberally to include not only the physical
disclosure of the records, but also the accessing of private records”). Regarding
actionability, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit has required that a record actually be retrieved. Armstrong v.
Geithner, 608 F.3d 854, 857 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Bartel, 725 F.2d at 1408, and
holding that, to be actionable, “a disclosure generally must be the result of
someone having actually retrieved the ‘record’ from that ‘system of records’; the
disclosure of information is not ordinarily a violation ‘merely because the
information happens to be contained in the records’”); Lambert v. United States,
No. 3:15-CV-147-PLR-HBG, 2016 WL 632461, at *4-5 (E.D. Tenn. Feb. 17, 2016).
But see Atkins v. Mabus, No. 12CV1390-GPC, 2014 WL 2705204, at *4-8 (S.D. Cal.
June 13, 2014) (holding unauthorized access not actionable under Privacy Act,
even though plaintiff’s declaration provided support for conclusion that
defendant’s employees individually improperly accessed plaintiff’s private
medical data); Cacho v. Chertoff, No. 06-00292(ESH), 2006 WL 3422548, at *5
(D.D.C. Nov. 28, 2006) (“[A] plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie claim under
the Privacy Act simply by showing that the agency official who disclosed a

Smith v. VA, No. CIV-06-865-R, 2007 WL 9711018 (W.D. Okla. Sept. 12, 2007)

A disclosure of information from a non-record source does not violate the Privacy Act’s
disclosure provision.
The disclosure of information “acquired from non-record sources – such as
observation, office emails, discussions with co-workers and the ‘rumor mill’–
does not violate the Privacy Act . . . even if the information disclosed is also
contained in agency records.” Lambert v. United States at *5 (quoting Cloonan,
768 F. Supp. 2d. at 164); Thompson v. BOP, No. 1:10-CV-00578-JOF, 2012 WL

552a(b), there must have initially been a retrieval from the system of records
which was at some point a source of the information.” (citations omitted));

In one case in which a plaintiff sought relief for alleged wrongful disclosure of
items seized during the execution of a search warrant, the court found,
“Appellant has failed to show that evidence seized during a search conducted in
a criminal investigation constitutes records that are “contained in a system of

Direct evidence that an agency disclosed a record is generally not required, but plaintiffs
must produce more than mere speculation or conjecture.
Circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to prove an unauthorized disclosure
occurred, although courts generally require corroborating evidence, rather than
mere speculation or conjecture. Because “plaintiffs can rarely produce direct
evidence that the government has disclosed confidential information obtained
from their private records, requiring such evidence would eviscerate the
protections of the Privacy Act.” Speaker v. HHS Ctrs. for Disease Control &

One district court has concluded that when an agency destroys evidence in order

However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit clarified that

73 F.3d 1111, 1117-24 (D.C. Cir. 1996). In Pilon, the D.C. Circuit held that the
Justice Department’s transmission of a Privacy Act-protected record to a former
employee of the agency constituted a “disclosure” under the Privacy Act, even
though the recipient had come “into contact with the [record] in the course of his
duties” while an employee. Id. The court’s “review of the Privacy Act’s
purposes, legislative history, and integrated structure convince[d it] that
Congress intended the term ‘disclose’ to apply in virtually all instances to an
agency’s unauthorized transmission of a protected record, regardless of the
recipient’s prior familiarity with it.” Id. at 1124.
In an earlier case, Hollis v. Army, 856 F.2d 1541 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the D.C. Circuit
had held that the release of a summary of individual child-support payments
previously deducted from plaintiff’s salary and sent directly to his ex-wife, who
had requested it for use in pending litigation, was not an unlawful disclosure
under the Privacy Act as she already knew what had been remitted to her. Id. at
1545. In Pilon, the D.C. Circuit reconciled its opinion in Hollis by “declin[ing] to
extend Hollis beyond the limited factual circumstances that gave rise to it,” 73
F.3d at 1112, 1124, and holding that:
[A]n agency’s unauthorized release of a protected record does
constitute a disclosure under the Privacy Act except in those rare
instances, like Hollis, where the record merely reflects information
that the agency has previously, and lawfully, disseminated outside
the agency to the recipient, who is fully able to reconstruct its
material contents.

“disclosure” for purposes of Privacy Act).
Courts are split over whether a disclosure occurs if the information disclosed is publicly
available or was previously published.
Courts have also split over whether the disclosure of information that is readily
accessible to the public constitutes a “disclosure” under the Privacy Act. The
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, along with several district courts, has
concluded that there is no “disclosure” in the release of previously published or
publicly available information under the Privacy Act, regardless of whether the
particular persons who received the information were aware of the previous
publication. FDIC v. Dye, 642 F.2d at 836; Banks v. Butler, No. 5:08cv336, 2010
WL 4537902, at *6 (S.D. Miss. Sept. 23, 2010); Drennon-Gala v. Holder, No. 1:08CV0321G, 2011 WL 1225784, at *8 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 30, 2011); Mudd v. Army, 2007
WL 4358262, at *5 (finding no “disclosure” where, inter alia, agency had posted
statement on its web site, newspapers had referred to letter, plaintiff had
testified before Congress regarding letter, and the entire report had been
released to the press and in a news conference by another agency); Smith v.
Cont’l Assurance Co., No. 91-C-0963, 1991 WL 164348, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 22,
1991); King, 471 F. Supp. at 181; cf. Sierra Pac. Indus. v. USDA, No. 11-1250, 2012
WL 245973, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 25, 2012) (finding that Privacy Act did not
require sealing documents where “substance of the information . . . [was] already
in the public record in one form or another”).
The Third, Ninth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, however, have held that the release
of information that is “merely readily accessible to the public” does constitute a
disclosure under subsection (b). See, e.g., Quinn v. Stone, 978 F.2d 126, 134 (3d
Cir. 1992) (holding that “[t]o define disclosure so narrowly as to exclude
information that is readily accessible to the public would render superfluous the
detailed statutory scheme of twelve exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure”);
see also Gowan v. Air Force, 148 F.3d 1182, 1193 (10th Cir. 1998) (“adopt[ing] the
Third Circuit’s reasoning [in Quinn] and hold[ing] that an agency may not
defend a release of Privacy Act information simply by stating that the
information is a matter of public record”); Scarborough v. Harvey, 493 F. Supp.
2d 1, 15-16 n.29 (D.D.C. 2007) (agreeing with Quinn and concluding that “the
unqualified language of the Privacy Act,” which protects individual’s “criminal .
. . history,” does not exclude information that is readily accessible to public); cf.
Wright v. FBI, 241 F. App’x 367, 369 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that “issue of whether
a Privacy Act claim can be based on a defendant’s disclosure of information
previously disclosed to the public is a matter of first impression,” and directing

district court to stay proceedings until plaintiff “obtains from the district
court . . . an order defining the scope of his claims and, potentially, stating that
court’s position on whether the Privacy Act applies to information previously
disclosed to the public”); Pilon v. DOJ, 796 F. Supp. 7, 11-12 (D.D.C. 1992)
(rejecting argument that information was already public and therefore could not
violate Privacy Act where agency had republished statement that was previously
publicly disavowed as false by agency).
The D.C. Circuit’s opinions in Hollis and Pilon, both discussed above, provide
some insight into its view of whether the release of information that is already
available to the public constitutes a “disclosure” under the Privacy Act. In
Hollis, issued in 1988, the D.C. Circuit had recognized in dictum that other
courts had held that the release of previously published material did not
constitute a disclosure, and suggested that it might take that approach. Hollis,
856 F.2d at 1545. The court had held that a disclosure did not violate the Privacy
Act because the recipient of the information already was aware of it, but that
“[o]ther courts have echoed the sentiment that when a release consists merely of
information to which the general public already has access, or which the
recipient of the release already knows, the Privacy Act is not violated.”
However, the D.C. Circuit’s subsequent holding in 1996 in Pilon appears to
foreclose such a possibility. In Pilon, the D.C. Circuit held that even under the
narrow Hollis interpretation of “disclose,” the agency would not be entitled to
summary judgment because it had “failed to adduce sufficient evidence that [the
recipient of the record] remembered and could reconstruct the document’s
material contents in detail at the time he received it.” 73 F.3d at 1124-26.
Nevertheless, the D.C. Circuit in Pilon noted that “[t]his case does not present
the question of whether an agency may . . . release a document that has already
been fully aired in the public domain through the press or some other means”
but that “the Privacy Act approves those disclosures that are ‘required’ under
the [FOIA] . . . and that under various FOIA exemptions, prior publication is a
factor to be considered in determining whether a document properly is to be
released.” Id. at 1123 n.10; see also Barry v. DOJ, 63 F. Supp. 2d 25, 27-28 (D.D.C.
1999) (distinguishing Pilon and finding no disclosure where agency posted
Inspector General report on Internet website, after report had already been fully
released to media by Congress and had been discussed in public congressional
hearing, even though some Internet users might encounter report for first time
on website). Furthermore, though, and consistent with the D.C. Circuit’s note in
Pilon, one might argue that to say that no “disclosure” occurs for previously
published or public information is at least somewhat inconsistent with the
Supreme Court’s decision in DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press,
489 U.S 749, 762-71 (1989), which held that a privacy interest can exist, under the
FOIA, in publicly available – but “practically obscure” – information, such as a

criminal history record. Cf. Finley v. NEA, 795 F. Supp. 1457, 1468 (C.D. Cal.
1992) (alleged disclosure of publicly available information states claim for relief
under Privacy Act; recognizing Reporters Comm.).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has issued
contradictory unpublished decisions on the issue of whether release of publicly
available information constitutes a disclosure. Compare Lee v. Dearment, 966
F.2d 1442 (4th Cir. 1992) (unpublished table case) (upholding district court’s
determination that “the Act does not prohibit disclosure of information which is
already open to the public, or if the receiver already knew of it” (citing Hollis v.
Army, 856 F.2d at 1545)), and Dye, 642 F.2d at 836, with Doe v. Herman, No.
297CV00043, 1999 WL 1000212, at *11 (W.D. Va. Oct. 29, 1999) (magistrate’s
recommendation) (agreeing with Quinn v. Stone, 798 F.2d at 134, in dictum and
concluding that discussion of social security numbers at public hearing did not
free agency to disclose those numbers), adopted in pertinent part & rev’d in
other part (W.D. Va. July 24, 2000), aff’d in part, rev’d in part & remanded, on
other grounds sub nom. Doe v. Chao, 306 F.3d 170 (4th Cir. 2002) (finding that
plaintiff had not established “actual damages” from disclosure), aff’d, 540 U.S.
614 (2004).
The Ninth Circuit has applied the “single publication rule,” in which the court limits
aggregate, unauthorized disclosures to only one cause of action, where an agency
disclosed records on an agency web page.
On a related point, the Ninth Circuit held in a subsection (b) case that the “single
publication rule” applies to postings on an agency’s web site such that “the
aggregate communication can give rise to only one cause of action.” See Oja v.
Army Corps of Eng’rs, 440 F.3d 1122, 1130-33 (9th Cir. 2006) (affirming summary
judgment for Army Corps which had posted employees’ personal information
on its public website). However, the court also ruled that with regard to “the
same private information at a different URL address [within the same Web site] .
. . that disclosure constitutes a separate and distinct publication – one not
foreclosed by the single publication rule – and [the agency] might be liable for a
separate violation of the Privacy Act.” Id. at 1133-34.
A public filing of records with a court during the course of litigation constitutes a
disclosure.
The fact that “a court is not defined as an ‘agency’ or as a ‘person’ for purposes
of [the Privacy Act],” (see Definitions, infra), indicates the Act was “not designed
to interfere with access to information by the courts.” 120 Cong. Rec. 36,967

attachments to affidavit in FOIA lawsuit “did not fall within any of the
exceptions listed in Section 552a”), reconsideration granted & vacated in
nonpertinent part (D.D.C. Nov. 29, 1984) (discussed below).
The Privacy Act disclosure provision does not require heightened discovery
requirements.
Often during the course of litigation, an agency will be asked to produce Privacy
Act-protected information pursuant to a discovery request by an opposing party.
The Privacy Act “does not create a qualified discovery privilege” or “any other
kind of privilege or bar that requires a party to show actual need as a
prerequisite to invoking discovery,” and courts generally consider whether to
allow discovery under “the usual discovery standards” of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure.” Laxalt v. McClatchy, 809 F.2d 885, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1987); see also

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Agencies may affirmatively disclose Privacy Act-protected records during litigation, so
long as the disclosure is made in accordance with the Privacy Act’s disclosure provision
Although courts have unanimously held that the Privacy Act does not create a
privilege against discovery, an agency can disclose Privacy Act-protected records
if permitted by the Act. The most appropriate method of disclosure in this
situation may be pursuant to a subsection (b)(11) court order. See generally Doe
v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Doe v. Stephens, 851 F.2d 1457 (D.C.
Cir. 1988) (both discussed below under subsection (b)(11)). Indeed, the courts
that have rejected the Privacy Act as a discovery privilege have referenced
subsection (b)(11)’s allowance for court-ordered disclosures. See Laxalt, 809 F.2d
at 888-89; Weahkee, 621 F.2d at 1082; Garraway v. Ciufo, No.
117CV00533DADGSAPC, 2020 WL 1263562, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2020)
(records that might otherwise be protected by the Act may still be discovered
through litigation if ordered by a court); Lightsey v. Potter, No. 1:04-CV-3110ODE, 2006 WL 8431955 (N.D. Ga. July 27, 2006); Hernandez v. United States, No.
97-3367, 1998 WL 230200, at *2-3 (E.D. La. May 6, 1998); Forrest, 1996 WL 171539,
at *2; Ford Motor Co., 825 F. Supp. at 1082-83; Clavir, 84 F.R.D. at 614; cf. Alford
v. Todco, No. CIV-88-731E, slip op. at 4-5 (W.D.N.Y. June 12, 1990) (ordering
production of records and concluding that “[e]ven assuming the Privacy Act
supplies a statutory privilege . . . the plaintiff has waived any such privilege by
placing his physical condition at issue”); Tootle v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 468
So. 2d 237, 239 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984) (recognizing that privacy interests in
that case “must give way to the function of the discovery of facts” and that
subsection (b)(11) provides the mechanism for disclosure).
When an agency wishes to make an affirmative disclosure of information during
litigation it may either rely on a routine use permitting such disclosure or seek a
court order. Because the Privacy Act does not constitute a statutory privilege,
agencies need not worry about breaching or waiving such a privilege when
disclosing information pursuant to subsections (b)(3) or (b)(11). Cf. Mangino v.
Army, No. 94-2067, 1994 WL 477260, at *5-6 (D. Kan. Aug. 24, 1994) (finding that
disclosure to court was appropriate pursuant to agency routine use and stating
that to extent Privacy Act created privilege, such privilege was waived by
plaintiff when he placed his records at issue through litigation); Lemasters v.
Thomson, No. 92 C 6158, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7513, at *3-8 (N.D. Ill. June 3,
1993) (same finding as in Mangino, despite fact that “court ha[d] not located”
applicable routine use). See also Vaughan v. Ky. Army Nat’l, No. 3:12-33, 2013
WL 1856418, at *4 (E.D. Ky. May 1, 2013) (finding that routine use disclosure to
Department of Justice was appropriate for purposes of defending agency against
claims pertaining to plaintiff’s records at issue in litigation). For further
discussions of disclosures during litigation, see “Conditions of Disclosure to

Third Parties,” subsections “5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(3) - Routine Uses” and “5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(b)(11) - Court Order,” below.
Agencies are not prohibited from disclosing to an individual his own record in response
to a “first party” access request pursuant to the Privacy Act’s access provisions.
By its own terms, subsection (b) does not prohibit an agency from releasing to an
individual his own record, contained in a system of records retrieved by his
name or personal identifier, in response to his “first-party” access request under
subsection (d)(1). Cf. Weatherspoon v. Provincetowne Master Owners Ass’n,
No. 08-cv-02754, 2010 WL 936109, at *3 (D. Colo. Mar. 15, 2010) (finding that even
though records were maintained by Veterans Administration (“VA”), where
plaintiff had been ordered in discovery to produce her mental health records in
her emotional distress suit, there would be no improper disclosure to an
‘unauthorized party’ because “the VA will disclose Plaintiff’s mental health
records to her, so that she can transmit copies of them to defense counsel”).
However, as is discussed below under “Individual’s Right of Access,” the courts
have split as to whether a disclosure occurs when the record is disclosed to the
individual who is the subject of the record where the record is also about another
individual and is “dually retrieved.”
Subsection (b) also explicitly authorizes disclosures made with the prior written
consent of the individual. See, e.g., Taylor v. Potter, No. 02-1552, 2004 WL
422664, at *1-2 (D. Del. Mar. 4, 2004) (finding it to be “clear from the documents
attached to Plaintiff’s complaint that she provided prior written consent . . . for
her medical records to be disclosed”); Scherer v. Hill, No. 02-2043, 2002 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 17872, at *6-8 (D. Kan. Sept. 17, 2002) (finding plaintiff’s argument that
agency violated his privacy by sending photographs of his skin condition to
United States Attorney rather than directly to him to be “frivolous,” as “[h]e
specifically asked the ‘US Attorney and the Veterans Administration’ to produce
the photographs” in his motion to compel, and “Privacy Act does not prohibit
the consensual disclosure of photographs or documents by an agency”); cf.
Stokes v. SSA, 292 F. Supp. 2d 178, 181 (D. Me. 2003);(finding that statement
directed at subject of record “did not become the kind of ‘disclosure’ for which
the Privacy Act requires written consent merely because [a third party]
overheard it,” especially given that individual consented to interview in third
party’s presence and thereby, in accordance with the agency regulation,
“affirmatively authorized [third party’s] presence during this discussion”; “The
Privacy Act does not prevent an agency employee from discussing the contents
of a protected record with the person to whom the record pertains.”).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Agencies cannot be held liable for disclosures that individuals make themselves.
Additionally, although it may seem self-evident, the fact pattern in one case
caused a court to explicitly hold that an agency cannot be sued for disclosures
that an individual makes himself. Abernethy v. IRS, 909 F. Supp. 1562, 1571
(N.D. Ga. 1995) (describing that plaintiff had informed employees that he was
being removed from his position as their supervisor and disclosed reason for his
removal).
While “written consent” under the Privacy Act is not defined, courts have held that
“implied consent” is not sufficient.
The Act does not define the “written consent” needed to permit disclosure under
the Privacy Act. Implied consent, however, is insufficient. See Taylor v. Orr, No.
83-0389, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20334, at *6 n.6 (D.D.C. Dec. 5, 1983) (addressing
alternative argument, stating that: “Implied consent is never enough” as the
Act’s protections “would be seriously eroded if plaintiff’s written submission of
[someone’s] name were construed as a voluntary written consent to the
disclosure of her [medical] records to him”); cf. Milton v. DOJ, 783 F. Supp. 2d
55, 59 (D.D.C. 2011) (rejecting, in context of Freedom of Information Act claim,
plaintiff’s argument that his privacy waiver to permit BOP to monitor his
telephone calls impliedly extended to any party who accepted his calls; “[A]
protected privacy interest can be waived only by the person whose interest is
affected, . . . and [plaintiff] has not produced Privacy Act waivers from the
individuals with whom he spoke on the telephone.”); Baitey v. VA, No. 8:CV89706, slip op. at 5 (D. Neb. June 21, 1995) (concluding that “at a minimum, the
phrase ‘written consent’ necessarily requires either (1) a medical authorization
signed by [plaintiff] or (2) conduct which, coupled with the unsigned
authorization, supplied the necessary written consent for the disclosure”). But

“equitable estoppel” to bar individual from complaining of disclosure of his

Fla. Feb. 11, 2011) (Where regulation mandated that DOJ furnish plaintiff’s
termination letter to MSPB, noting that it was plaintiff’s appeal to MSPB that
triggered the disclosure, “which did not require Plaintiff’s consent, which is
implied by virtue of his appeal.”); Jones v. Army Air Force Exchange Serv.

pursuant to congressional office inquiries that were initiated at Plaintiff’s
request”).
OMB guidelines suggest, and courts have generally approved of, written consent that
states the general purposes for, or types of recipients to, which disclosures may be made;
the scope of an agency’s permitted disclosures is then defined by the terms on which the
individual provided written consent.
The OMB 1975 Guidelines caution that “the consent provision was not intended
to permit a blanket or open-ended consent clause, i.e., one which would permit
the agency to disclose a record without limit,” and that, “[a]t a minimum, the
consent clause should state the general purposes for, or types of recipients [to,]
which disclosure may be made.” 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,954, https://www.justice.gov/
paoverview_omb-75. See also Perry v. FBI, 759 F.2d 1271, 1276 (7th Cir. 1985)
(upholding disclosure because release was “not so vague or general that it is
questionable whether [plaintiff] knew what he was authorizing or whether the
[agency] knew what documents it could lawfully release”), rev’d en banc on
other grounds, 781 F.2d 1294 (7th Cir. 1986).
Courts generally have approved disclosures made with consent where the
consent was broad enough to cover the disclosure. See Elnashar v. DOJ, 446 F.3d
792, 795 (8th Cir. 2006) (observing that plaintiff’s signed release “authoriz[ing]
representatives of [human rights organization] to obtain and examine copies of
all documents and records contained by the [FBI] . . . pertaining to [plaintiff]”
constituted consent for FBI to disclose “that it had records which were
responsive to the request for records and that records were contained in the
‘PENTBOMB’ investigation”); United States v. Rogers, No. 10-00088, 2010 WL
5441935, at *1 (S.D. Ala. Dec. 28, 2010) (concluding that “if defendant is willing to
make a written request to the BOP for his own records and give written consent
for their release to his defense counsel, the Court sees no reason why a[] [court]
order is necessary”); Roberts v. DOT, No. 02-CV-4414, 2006 WL 842401, at *8, *2
(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2006) (maintaining that plaintiff’s signed SF 171, which
“explicitly stated that [plaintiff] ‘consent[ed] to the release of information about
[his] ability and fitness for Federal employment,’” authorized disclosure of
plaintiff’s medical records by agency who previously employed him to
employing agency to assist in “assist determining whether the employee is
capable of performing the duties of the new position”); Thomas v. VA, 467 F.
Supp. 458, 460 n.4 (D. Conn. 1979) (holding consent was adequate because it was
both agency- and record-specific); cf. Tarullo v. Def. Contract Audit Agency, 600
F. Supp. 2d 352, 360-61 (D. Conn. 2009) (concluding that “the forms themselves
put the Plaintiff on notice that they (and hence their contents) would be
disclosed . . . . Yet, the Plaintiff supplied his SSN. As a result, he voluntarily

(concluding that plaintiff’s written release for employment application that
broadly authorized employer to corroborate and obtain information about
plaintiff’s background constituted valid consent under Privacy Act to authorize
disclosure of all 466 pages of plaintiff’s VA claims file in connection with union
grievance proceeding, even though release was signed eight years prior to
disclosure”).
On the other hand, courts have found consent clauses with narrower terms than
the eventual disclosure to be inadequate to authorize that disclosure. See
Schmidt v. Air Force, No. 06-3069, 2007 WL 2812148, at *8 (C.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2007)
(issuance of press release and posting of complete text of plaintiff’s reprimand on

to “a press release announcing the conclusion of the case”); Fattahi v. ATF, 186 F.
Supp. 2d 656, 660 (E.D. Va. 2002) (consent providing that information on
application “may be disclosed to members of the public in order to verify the

investigating acts of child abuse.” Stafford v. SSA, 437 F. Supp. 2d 1113, 1121
(N.D. Cal. 2006). In Stafford, a Social Security Administration (“SSA”) employee
disclosed to California Child Protective Services “the precise diagnosis of mental
illness on which the SSA had made its determination that [the suspected child
abuser] was disabled and thus eligible for benefits.” Id. at 1116. The suspect
brought a subsection (b)/(g)(1)(D) claim against the agency, and the agency
argued that the court should recognize a new exception because “[t]he public
interest in detecting and eradicating child abuse is so strong that under
California state law, malicious acts or acts taken without probable cause by
investigators such as [the Child Protective Services employee] are immunized.”
Id. at 1121. The court explained that “Congress enacted the Privacy Act as a
limitation on the sharing of private information among government agencies to
further what it determined was an important public policy” and stated that
“[t]he Court cannot create an exception to a federal statute based on state
policy.” Id.

Twelve Exceptions to the “No Disclosure without Consent” Rule
As discussed in detail above, the general rule under the Privacy Act is that,
without an individual’s written consent, records about that individual
maintained in a system of records cannot be disclosed. There are, however, a
number of exceptions to that general rule, or conditions under which
information can be disclosed without consent. Of the twelve exceptions
discussed in this section, the most significant and frequently litigated exceptions
are the “need to know” exception, disclosures required under FOIA, and the
“routine use” exception. The twelve exceptions are discussed here in turn.
Other than disclosures under subsection (b)(2) of the Privacy Act (see
“Conditions of Disclosure to Third Parties, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(2) - Required FOIA
Disclosure” discussion, below), disclosures under the following exceptions are
permissive, not mandatory. See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,953,

5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(1) - Need to Know within Agency
“No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of
records by any means of communication to any person, or to another
agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written
consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains unless the disclosure
would be –

The “need to know” disclosure exception authorizes intra-agency disclosures.
The “need to know” exception authorizes the intra-agency disclosure of a

overview_omb-75. The Privacy Act’s legislative history indicates an intent
“to give the term ‘agency’ its broadest statutory meaning,” and to permit
“need to know” disclosures between components of large agencies. See 120
Cong. Rec. 36,967 (1974), reprinted in Source Book at 958, https://www.
justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook (recognizing propriety of “need to
know” disclosures between DOJ components); see also Dick v. Holder, 67 F.
Supp. 3d 167, 177-178 (D.D.C. 2014) (stating that “552a(b)(1) does not
authorize disclosure outside the ‘agency,’ which this Court has defined
broadly to include sharing between component agencies underneath the
umbrella of the [Department], not just the specific agency that originally
held the information, such as the FBI in this instance”); Sussman v. Marshals
Serv., 808 F. Supp. 2d 192, 196-204 (D.D.C. 2011) (recognizing that
“[a]lthough the [Marshals Service] and FBI may themselves be considered
agencies, they are also components of DOJ, which is itself an agency,” under
the statutory meaning of the term, and that disclosures between them

plaintiffs’ drug testing schedules and results by EPA OIG to an EPA-hired
DOD investigator did not violate Privacy Act because “according to the
OMB 1975 Guidelines, an agency that hires a member of another agency to
serve in a temporary task force or similar, cross-designated function can
share otherwise protected information with that hired person and still
satisfy exception (b)(1)”); OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,954,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (“Movement of records
between personnel of different agencies may in some instances be viewed as
intra-agency disclosures if that movement is in connection with an interagency support agreement”).

Courts generally focus on whether the agency employee receiving the information
had a need for the record in the performance of the employee’s duties.
It is the employee receiving the information - not the employee making the
disclosure - who must have the “need to know.” So long as “the persons to
whom disclosure is made are employees of the agency that maintains the
records” and “those employees have a need for access,” disclosure under
this subsection “is not limited to the employees responsible for maintaining
the records.” See, e.g., Coburn v. Potter, 329 F. App’x 644, 646 (7th Cir.
2009); Cacho v. Chertoff, No. 06-00292, 2006 WL 3422548, *4-7 (D.D.C. Nov.
28, 2006) (finding plaintiff’s argument alleging improper access of
information irrelevant to (b)(1) analysis; “What matters then is the ‘need to
know’ of the agency official who received the disclosure, not the authority of
the agency official who made the disclosure.”); Gill v. DOD, 92 M.S.P.R. 23,
31-32 (2002) (finding disclosure to EEO counselor of other employees’
records appeared to fall within (b)(1) exception, where appellant provided
records at request of EEO counselor who was investigating appellant’s claim
that she was disparately treated).
Some courts have found the “need to know” disclosure exception to apply to
contractors who serve the function of agency employees.
Although subsection (b)(1) permits disclosure only to “those officers and
employees of the agency which maintains the record,” some courts have
upheld disclosures to contractors who serve the function of agency
employees. See Mount v. USPS, 79 F.3d at 532-34 (concluding disclosure of
plaintiff’s medical files to “a physician under contract with the USPS” who
had “responsibilities for making employment and/or disciplinary decisions
regarding plaintiff” had some basis in need to know exception); Gard v.

Taylor v. Orr, No. 83-0389, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20334, at *7-10 (D.D.C. Dec.
5, 1983).
Courts generally have found intra-agency disclosures regarding personnel or
employment matters as authorized disclosures under the “need to know” disclosure
exception.
The cases are replete with examples of proper intra-agency “need to know”
disclosures. By far the most frequent “need to know” disclosure that the
courts have deemed appropriate is for the purpose of investigating alleged
employee misconduct or making disciplinary determinations. See, e.g.,
Pippinger v. Rubin, 129 F.3d 519, 529-31 (10th Cir. 1997) (discussing
supervisor’s disclosure of identity of person being investigated to staff
members assisting in investigation, and to agency attorney defending

Similarly, where an employee has a “need to know” certain information for
personnel or employment determinations, the courts have found disclosure
appropriate. Tran v. Treasury, 351 F. Supp. 3d 130, 138-140 (D.D.C. 2019)

(discussing disclosure of employee’s medical report following fitness-forduty examination to Postmaster of Post Office where employee worked to
determine whether employee could perform essential functions of job and to
Postmaster’s supervisor who was to review Postmaster’s decision), aff’d per
curiam, 79 F.3d 1145 (5th Cir. 1996).
Courts generally have found intra-agency disclosures of records for national
security purposes to be authorized disclosures under the “need to know” disclosure
exception.
The courts also have concluded that an agency employee has a “need to
know” information that could affect national security. See, e.g., Bigelow v.
DOD, 217 F.3d 875, 876-78 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (describing review of plaintiff’s
personnel file by immediate supervisor in connection with supervisor’s
“continuing duty to make sure that [plaintiff] was worthy of trust” because
of “a need to examine the file in view of the doubts that had been raised in
his mind about [plaintiff] and [plaintiff’s] access to the country’s top
secrets”); Britt v. Naval Investigative Serv., 886 F.2d 544, 549 n.2 (3d Cir.
1989) (noting propriety of disclosure of investigative report to commanding
officer “since the Reserves might need to reevaluate Britt’s access to
sensitive information or the level of responsibility he was accorded”);

to plaintiff’s employer, Defense Logistics Agency, for purposes of revoking
employee’s security clearance).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Courts generally have found intra-agency disclosures of records to perform
administrative duties to be authorized disclosures under the “need to know”
disclosure exception.
Disclosure has been deemed appropriate where an employee has a “need to
know” information to perform an administrative duty. See Hudson v. Reno,
130 F.3d 1193, 1206-07 (6th Cir. 1997) (discussing disclosure of plaintiff’s
performance evaluation to individual who typed it originally, for retyping),
abrogated on other grounds by Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.,

Raty, No. 02:05-CV-85TC, 2007 WL 2317435, at *4-5 (D. Utah Aug. 7, 2007)
(finding that disclosure to law enforcement officer within agency fit within
need to know exception because “record clearly shows that the purpose for
the disclosures in this instance was to pursue forfeiture of funds . . . a task
which is clearly within [employees’] duties as federal law enforcement
officers”); Schmidt v. VA, 218 F.R.D. 619, 631 (E.D. Wis. 2003) (“VA
personnel need to have access to the entire [social security number] of
persons accessible through the [Computerized Patient Records System] to
avoid misidentification.”).
Courts generally have found intra-agency disclosures of records to provide medical
treatment or assess medical expenses as authorized disclosures under the “need to
know” disclosure exception.
Courts also have allowed disclosure under the “need to know” exception
where the information is needed to provide medical treatment or expenses
for medical treatment. McKinley v. United States, No. 3:14-CV-01931, 2015
WL 4663206, at *8 (D. Or. Aug. 5, 2015) (“The information contained in

at *7-8 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 1999) (discussing disclosure of plaintiff’s medical
records within VA so that his supervisor could document his request for
medical leave and determine level of work he could perform).
Courts generally have found that intra-agency disclosures to employees that do not
have a need for the record in the performance of their duties are outside the scope of
the “need to know” disclosure exception.
On the other hand, intra-agency disclosures to recipients who do not need
the information to perform their duties are improper. See, e.g., Parks v. IRS,
618 F.2d 677, 680-81 & n.1 (10th Cir. 1980) (holding plaintiffs had viable
claim for disclosure of names of employees who did not purchase savings

5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(2) - Required FOIA Disclosure
“No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of

...
(2) required under section 552 of this title [the Freedom of Information
Act].” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(2).
Comment:
As a function of the required FOIA disclosure exception, the Privacy Act never
prohibits a disclosure that the FOIA requires.
The Privacy Act never prohibits a disclosure that the Freedom of
Information Act actually requires. See News-Press v. DHS, 489 F.3d 1173,
1189 (11th Cir. 2007) (“The net effect of the interaction between the two
statutes is that where the FOIA requires disclosure, the Privacy Act will not
stand in its way, but where the FOIA would permit withholding under an
exemption, the Privacy Act makes such withholding mandatory upon the
agency.”); Greentree v. U.S. Customs Serv., 674 F.2d 74, 79 (D.C. Cir. 1982)
(stating subsection (b)(2) “represents a Congressional mandate that the
Privacy Act not be used as a barrier to FOIA access”). See also Burwell v.
EOUSA, 210 F. Supp. 3d 33, 36 (D.D.C. 2016) (“Privacy Act specifically
exempts from its nondisclosure provisions documents that are otherwise
required to be disclosed under the FOIA, see 5 U.S.C. §552a(b)(2), and
[89]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

EOUSA processed plaintiff’s request under the FOIA.”); Sikes v. United
States, 987 F. Supp. 2d 1355, 1372 n.14 (S.D. Ga. 2013) (finding that because
FOIA required disclosure of list of names of individuals invited to ceremony
at which Navy officer was sworn in as Chief of Naval Operations, Privacy
Act did not bar disclosure); Woods v. DOJ, 968 F. Supp. 2d 115, 120-21
(D.D.C. 2013) (finding that “defendant properly considered plaintiff’s
request in light of the FOIA, [and thus] any issue arising under the Privacy
Act is essentially moot”); Plunkett v. DOJ, 924 F. Supp. 2d 289, 306-07
(D.D.C. 2013) (“[T]he Privacy Act does not bar disclosure of documents that
are otherwise required to be disclosed under the FOIA . . . and defendant
properly reviewed and released responsive records under the FOIA.”).
Thus, if an agency is in receipt of a FOIA request for information about an
individual that is contained in a system of records and that is not properly
withholdable under any FOIA exemption, then it follows that the agency is
“required under Section 552 of this title” to disclose the information to the
FOIA requester. This would be a required subsection (b)(2) disclosure.
However, if a FOIA exemption – typically, Exemption 6 (personnel and
medical files) or Exemption 7(C) (law enforcement information that could be
an invasion of personal privacy) – applies to a Privacy Act-protected record,
the Privacy Act prohibits an agency from making a “discretionary” FOIA
release because that disclosure would not be “required” by the FOIA within
the meaning of subsection (b)(2). See, e.g., DOD v. FLRA, 510 U.S. 487, 502

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

After DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, the FOIA is less likely to
require disclosure of Privacy Act-protected records.
In DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 762-75
(1989), the Supreme Court significantly expanded the breadth of FOIA
Exemptions 6 and 7(C). The Court ruled that a privacy interest may exist in
publicly available information – such as the criminal history records there at
issue – where the information is “practically obscure.” Id. at 764-71. Even
more significantly, the Court held that the identity of the FOIA requester,
and any socially useful purpose for which the request was made, are not to
be considered in evaluating whether the “public interest” would be served
by disclosure. Id. at 771-75. The Court determined that the magnitude of
the public interest side of the balancing process can be assessed only by
reference to whether disclosure of the requested records directly advances
the “core purpose” of the FOIA – to shed light on the operations and
activities of the government. Id. at 774-75.
In light of Reporters Comm., personal information of the sort protected by
the Privacy Act is less likely to be “required” to be disclosed under the
FOIA, within the meaning of subsection (b)(2). Specifically, where an
agency determines that the only “public interest” that would be furthered
by a disclosure is a nonqualifying one under Reporters Comm. (even where
it believes that disclosure would be in furtherance of good public policy
generally), it may not balance in favor of disclosure under the FOIA and
therefore disclosure will be prohibited under the Privacy Act – unless
authorized by another Privacy Act exception or by written consent. See,
e.g., DOD v. FLRA, 510 U.S. at 497-502 (declining to “import the policy
considerations that are made explicit in the Labor Statute into the FOIA
Exemption 6 balancing analysis” and, following the principles of Reporters
Comm., holding that home addresses of bargaining unit employees are
covered by FOIA Exemption 6 and thus that Privacy Act “prohibits their
release to the unions”); Schwarz v. INTERPOL, 48 F.3d 1232 , at 1-2 & n.2
(10th Cir. Feb. 28, 1995) (balancing under Reporters Comm. and holding that
individual clearly has protected privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of
his whereabouts to third parties; disclosure of this information would not
“contribute anything to the public’s understanding of the operations or
activities of the government”; and thus any information was exempt from
disclosure under FOIA Exemption 7(C) and does not fall within Privacy Act
exception (b)(2)); FLRA v. Commerce, 962 F.2d 1055, 1059 (D.C. Cir. 1992)

of Reporters Comm., agencies depend more on the subsection (b)(3) routine

required by the FOIA to be disclosed. See, e.g., USDA v. FLRA, 876 F.2d 50,

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The D.C. Circuit has held that the required FOIA disclosure exception cannot be
invoked unless an agency actually has a FOIA request in hand; not all courts agree.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit significantly
limited the utility of subsection (b)(2) as a defense by holding that
subsection (b)(2) cannot be invoked unless an agency actually has a FOIA
request in hand. Bartel v. FAA, 725 F.2d 1403, 1411-13 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see
also Chang v. Navy, 314 F. Supp. 2d 35, 41-42 (D.D.C. 2004) (citing Bartel,
and noting that defendant agency conceded that it “had no FOIA request in
hand”). In one case prior to Bartel, it similarly had been held that subsection
(b)(2) was not available as a defense for the disclosure of information in the
absence of a FOIA request. Zeller v. United States, 467 F. Supp. 487, 503
(E.D.N.Y. 1979) (finding subsection (b)(2) inapplicable to the “voluntary rerelease” of a prior press release (that had been made prior to the effective
date of the Privacy Act) as “nothing in the FOIA appears to require such
information to be released in the absence of a request therefor”).
Other courts have not followed the rule in Bartel, however, and do not
require agencies to have a FOIA request in hand to raise a (b)(2) defense.
See Cochran v. United States, 770 F.2d 949, 957-58 & n.14 (11th Cir. 1985)
(applying subsection (b)(2) – in absence of written FOIA request – because
requested records would not be withholdable under any FOIA exemption);
Jafari v. Navy, 728 F.2d 247, 249-50 (4th Cir. 1984) (same); Russo v. United
States, 576 F. Supp. 2d 662, 671-72 (D.N.J. 2008) (alternative holding)
(expressing reluctance to follow Bartel because subsection (b)(2)’s
conditional language of “would be” rather than “is” “casts serious doubt
upon Plaintiff’s argument that the exception only applies where the agency
is faced with a written FOIA request”); Mudd v. Army, No. 2:05-cv-137, 2007
WL 4358262, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 10, 2007) (agreeing with agency that
“under the circumstances of this case, the balance of plaintiff’s privacy
against the public’s right to disclosure weighs in favor of public disclosure,
and that the FOIA exception was applicable even without a formal FOIA
request”).
However, because the D.C. Circuit is the jurisdiction of “universal venue”
under the Privacy Act -- i.e., any Privacy Act lawsuit for wrongful disclosure
could be filed within that judicial circuit -- see 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(5) -- its
holding in Bartel is of paramount importance. See FOIA Update, Vol. V, No.
3, at 2, http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_V_3/page2.htm
(discussing Bartel). Note also, though, that the Bartel decision left open the
possibility that certain types of information “traditionally released by an
agency to the public” might properly be disclosed even in the absence of an

actual FOIA request. 725 F.2d at 1413 (dictum). Reacting to Bartel, OMB
issued guidance indicating that records that have “traditionally” been
considered to be in the public domain, and those that are required to be
disclosed to the public – such as names and office telephone numbers of
agency employees – can be released without waiting for an actual FOIA
request. Memorandum from Robert P. Bedell, Deputy Administrator, Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, for the Senior Agency Officials for
Information Resource Management, Privacy Act Guidance – Update (May
24, 1985) [hereinafter OMB Bedell Memo], https://www.justice.gov/pa
overview_omb-85 (“Records which have traditionally been considered to be
in the public domain and are required to be disclosed to the public, such as
many of the final orders and opinions of quasi-judicial agencies, press
releases, etc. may be released under this provision without waiting for a
specific Freedom of Information Act request”); see also OMB Call Detail
Guidance, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-87-cd (applying Bartel
to “call detail” programs); OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,954,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75.
The District Court for the District of Columbia twice has applied this public
domain aspect of Bartel. In Tripp v. DOD, 193 F. Supp. 2d 229, 236 (D.D.C.
2002), the D.C. District Court held that “the names, titles, salaries, and
salary-levels of public employees are information generally in the public
domain” and thus that they are not prohibited from disclosure under
subsection (b)(2). In Chang v. Navy, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 42, the District Court
found that the Privacy Act was not violated where the Navy disclosed
information to the media about plaintiff’s nonjudicial punishment, because
the information was “releasable” under the FOIA, and the Navy had
asserted that it “traditionally releases information that would be releasable
under the FOIA to the press without a formal FOIA request,” and was able
to point to a Navy regulation to that effect. Id; see also Russo, 576 F. Supp.
2d at 670-73 (D.N.J. 2008) (alternative holding) (concluding disclosure of
active duty military status did not violate Privacy Act because “duty status
is the sort of public-domain information traditionally released to the public
in the absence of a FOIA request”).

agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written

would be -...
(3) for a routine use as defined in subsection (a)(7) of this section and
described under subsection (e)(4)(D).” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(3).
Cross-references:
Subsection (a)(7) defines the term “routine use” to mean “with respect to the
disclosure of a record, the use of such record for a purpose which is
compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.”
Subsection (e)(4)(D) requires Federal Register publication of “each routine
use of the records contained in the system, including the categories of users
and the purpose of such use.”
Comment:
The routine use disclosure exception is broad and was designed to allow disclosures
other than intra-agency disclosures.
The routine use exception, because of its potential breadth, is one of the
most controversial provisions in the Act. See Privacy Commission Report,
at 517-18, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_ppsc. The trend in recent
cases is toward a narrower construction of the exception. The White House
directed the OMB to issue additional guidance regarding the routine use
exception in an executive memorandum on privacy sent to the heads of
executive departments and agencies in 1998. Memorandum on Privacy and
Personal Information in Federal Records, 34 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 870

2006 WL 166531, at *8 n.8 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 20, 2006) (on motion to dismiss,
disagreeing with plaintiff that “routine use” should be defined as “the
disclosure of a record outside of [DOD]” and explaining that “the ‘routine
use’ exception specifically states that disclosure is allowed ‘for a routine use
as defined in subsection (a)(7) of [the Act]’”); cf. Shayesteh v. Raty, No.
02:05-CV-85TC, 2007 WL 2317435, at *5 (D. Utah Aug. 7, 2007) (concluding
that disclosures were proper under subsection (b)(1) and explaining that
purpose of disclosures was compatible with purpose of collection under
subsection (b)(3)).
The routine use disclosure exception requires an agency to: (1) publish the routine
use to provide constructive notice; and (2) disclose records only when compatible
with the purpose for which the record was collected; some courts also have required
agencies to provide actual notice in accordance with subsection (e)(3)(C).
An agency must meet two requirements for a proper routine use disclosure
under this exception: (1) an agency must publish the routine use in the
Federal Register to provide constructive notice; and (2) the disclosure of the
record must be compatible with the purpose for which the record was
collected. See, e.g., Britt v. Naval Investigative Serv., 886 F.2d 544, 547-50
(3d Cir. 1989); Brunotte v. Johnson, 892 F. Supp. 2d 199, 207 (D.D.C. 2012);
Shannon v. Gen. Elec. Co., 812 F. Supp. 308, 316 (N.D.N.Y. 1993).
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has added a third requirement
for this exception, which the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit subsequently adopted: actual notice at the time the information is
collected from the individual of the purpose(s) for which the information
will be used. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3)(C); Covert v. Harrington, 876 F.2d
751, 754-56 (9th Cir. 1989) (discussed below); USPS v. Nat’l Ass’n of Letter
Carriers, 9 F.3d 138, 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993).

Federal Register Constructive Notice
Before relying on the routine use disclosure exception, an agency must publish in
the Federal Register each routine use, including the categories of users and the
purpose of such use.
The notice requirement of the routine use exception “is intended to serve
as a caution to agencies to think out in advance what uses [they] will
make of information.” 120 Cong. Rec. 40,881 (1974), reprinted in Source
Book at 987, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Indeed, a routine use could be deemed facially invalid if it fails to satisfy
subsection (e)(4)(D), and specify “the categories of users and the purpose
of such use.” See Britt, 886 F.2d at 547-48 (dictum) (suggesting that
routine use, 50 Fed. Reg. 22,802-03 (May 29, 1985) (permitting disclosure
to “federal regulatory agencies with investigative units” is overbroad
because it “does not provide adequate notice to individuals as to what
information concerning them will be released and the purposes of such
release); cf. Krohn v. DOJ, No. 78-1536, slip op. at 4-7 (D.D.C. Mar. 19,
1984) (“[T]o qualify as a ‘routine use,’ the agency must . . . publish in the
Federal Register . . . ‘each routine use of the records contained in the
system, including the categories of users and the purpose of such use.’”),
reconsideration granted & vacated in non-pertinent part, (D.D.C. Nov. 29,
1984) (discussed below).
The scope of the routine use disclosure exception is limited to the published terms
of the claimed routine use.
It is well settled that the “scope of [a] routine use[ ] is confined by the
published definition.” Doe v. Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Fla., 768 F.2d
1229, 1231 (11th Cir. 1985); see also Parks v. IRS, 618 F.2d 677, 681-82 (10th
Cir. 1980); Tran v. Treasury, 351 F. Supp. 3d 130, 137 (D.D.C. 2019); Local

1976), aff’d, 573 F.2d 184 (4th Cir. 1978). In other words, a particular
disclosure is unauthorized if it does not fall within the clear terms of the
routine use. See, e.g., Swenson v. USPS, 890 F.2d 1075, 1078 (9th Cir. 1989)
(stating that, consistent with Federal Register notice, “[d]isclosure may be
made to a congressional office from the record of an individual in
response to an inquiry from the congressional office made at the request
of that individual”); Tijerina v. Walters, 821 F.2d 789, 798 (D.C. Cir. 1987)
(VA’s unsolicited letter notifying state board of bar examiners of possible
fraud did not qualify for Privacy Act’s routine use exception because the
published routine use only permitted disclosure based upon official
request of state agency and no such request was made); Doe v. DiGenova,
779 F.2d 74, 86 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding routine use exception inapplicable
to VA psychiatric report because published routine use allowed referral of
records to law enforcement officials only when records themselves
indicated violation of law, and record itself did not “indicate[ ] . . . a
potential violation of law”); Tran, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 137 (holding that
routine use allowing disclosure to “a Federal . . . agency . . .[of]
information relevant or necessary to hiring or retaining an employee . . .
or other benefit” did not permit intra-agency disclosure of plaintiff’s
performance evaluation in connection with plaintiff’s detail request);

grounds, 876 F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1989).
When interpreting a claimed routine use, courts have generally deferred to
agency interpretation.
An agency’s construction of its routine use should be entitled to
deference. See Air Force v. FLRA, 104 F.3d 1396, 1402 (D.C. Cir. 1997)
(according great deference to OPM’s interpretation of its routine use);
FLRA v. Treasury, 884 F.2d 1446, 1455-56 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (“For purposes
of determining the scope of OPM’s routine use notice . . . an official OPM
interpretation would be entitled to great deference.”); Makowski v.
United States, 27 F. Supp. 3d 901, 912 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (deferring to, and
finding reasonable, agencies’ interpretation and application of Enhanced
Border Security Act because Court found statute ambiguous as to what it
required FBI to do upon receiving plaintiff’s fingerprints, thus finding
publication requirement of FBI’s routine use exception to have been met);
Radack v. DOJ, 402 F. Supp. 2d 99, 106 n.7 (D.D.C. 2005) (“The court must
grant ‘great deference’ to agency interpretations of routine uses.”); cf.
Stafford, 437 F. Supp. 2d at 1119 (relying on SSA regulations for
proposition that “SSA generally would consider a use to be compatible if
it relates to determining eligibility for needs-based income maintenance . .
. or related medical benefits for low-income people” and concluding that
SSA’s disclosure of child abuse suspect’s “precise medical diagnosis to
[California Child Protective Services] . . . was not compatible with the
purpose for which the information was collected”). But see NLRB v.
USPS, 790 F. Supp. 31, 33 (D.D.C. 1992) (rejecting Postal Service’s
interpretation of its own routine use).
Compatibility
The term “compatible” is not defined in the Privacy Act, and agencies must
assess, on a case-by-case basis, when a disclosure is compatible in accordance with
the routine use disclosure exception.
The precise meaning of the term “compatible” is uncertain and must be
assessed on a case-by-case basis. According to OMB, the “compatibility”
concept encompasses (1) functionally equivalent uses and (2) other uses
that are necessary and proper. OMB Call Detail Guidance, 52 Fed. Reg. at
12,993, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-87-cd.
In Britt, an early, leading case on “compatibility,” the Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit ruled that the Naval Investigative Service’s gratuitous

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

disclosure of records, describing a then-pending criminal investigation of
a Marine Corps reservist, to that individual’s civilian employer (the
Immigration and Naturalization Service) was not “compatible” with the
“case-specific purpose for collecting” such records. 886 F.2d at 547-50.
Holding that the employment/suitability purpose for disclosure was
incompatible with the criminal law enforcement purpose for collection,
the Third Circuit deemed significant that “[t]here is nothing in the record
suggesting that the [Immigration and Naturalization Service] was
conducting its own criminal investigation of the same activity or any
other activity” by the subject and that the records at issue concerned
“merely a preliminary investigation with no inculpatory findings.” Id. at
549-50. Employing especially broad language, the Third Circuit pointedly
condemned the agency’s equating of “compatibility” with mere
“relevance” to the recipient entity, observing that “[t]here must be a more
concrete relationship or similarity, some meaningful degree of
convergence, between the disclosing agency’s purpose in gathering the
information and in its disclosure.” Id. (citing Covert, 876 F.2d at 755
(dictum)); see also Chichakli v. Tillerson, 882 F.3d 229, 233-34 (D.C. Cir.
2018) (holding that purpose of collection of plaintiff’s identifying
information by State Department and Office of Foreign Assets Control
was to investigate whether to designate plaintiff for economic sanctions
and implement sanctions, which was “precisely aligned” with purpose of
disclosure – to implement sanctions by making information public);

and its purpose in disclosing report to plaintiff’s new agency was
precisely same, to prevent misconduct by plaintiff at another national

because disclosure was compatible with one of purposes for collection,
even if not compatible with main purpose for collection).
The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit interpreted the term
“compatibility” in considering a routine use that provided for disclosure
to labor organizations as part of the collective bargaining process. The
court stated that “common usage” of the word would require simply that
“a proposed disclosure would not actually frustrate the purposes for
which the information was gathered.” USPS, 9 F.3d at 144. The D.C.

Circuit recognized the “far tighter nexus” required by the Third and
Ninth Circuits in Britt and Swenson, which is consistent with the
legislative history, but stated:

imposed by section 552a(a)(7) cannot be understood to prevent
an agency from disclosing to a union information as part of the
collective bargaining process.
Id. at 145. In a concurring opinion, Judge Williams agreed with the
disposition of the case, but noted that he did not share the “belief that the
meaning of ‘compatible’ . . . may depend on the identity of the entity to
which information is being disclosed.” Id. at 147 n.1 (Williams, J.,
concurring). Rather, seeing “no conflict between the purposes for which
the information was collected and those for which it will be disclosed,” he
found the disclosure to be compatible without further inquiry. Id. at 14647. But cf. Pontecorvo v. FBI, No. 00-1511, slip op. at 10-11 (D.D.C. Sept.
30, 2001) (recognizing the D.C. Circuit’s holding in USPS case, but finding
“the test articulated by the Third and Ninth circuits to be controlling” in
the non-labor law context).
OMB guidelines, and some courts, have found that routine use disclosures to law
enforcement agencies in the context of investigations or prosecutions, or when the
record indicates a possible violation of law, are “compatible” disclosures under
the routine use disclosure exception.
Two examples of “compatible” routine uses frequently occur in the law
enforcement context. First, in the context of investigations or
prosecutions, law enforcement agencies routinely may share law
enforcement records with one another. See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed.
Reg. at 28,955, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (“Records in
law enforcement systems may also be disclosed for law enforcement
purposes when that disclosure has properly been established as a ‘routine
use’; e.g., . . . transfer by a law enforcement agency of protective
intelligence information to the Secret Service.”); see also, e.g., 28 U.S.C.
§ 534 (2018) (requiring Attorney General to exchange criminal records
with “authorized officials of the Federal Government . . . , the States . . . ,
Indian tribes, cities, and penal and other institutions”).

Second, agencies routinely may disclose to law enforcement agencies for
purposes of investigation or prosecution any records indicating a possible
violation of law (regardless of the purpose for collection) if the head of the
law enforcement agency specifically requests the record in writing from
the agency that maintains the record. See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed.
Reg. at 28,953, 28,955, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75

opcl/paoverview_sourcebook; see also, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 535(b) (2018)
(requiring agencies of executive branch to report expeditiously to U.S.
Attorney General “[a]ny information, allegation, matter, or complaint”
relating to crimes involving government officers and employees).
These compatible use disclosures to law enforcement agencies have been
criticized on the ground that they circumvent the more restrictive
requirements of subsection (b)(7). See Privacy Commission Report, at
517-18, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_ppsc; see also Britt, 886 F.2d
at 548 n.1 (dictum); Covert, 667 F. Supp. at 739, 742 (dictum). They never
have been challenged successfully on that basis, however. Indeed, courts
routinely have upheld disclosures made pursuant to such routine uses.
See, e.g., Bansal v. Pavlock, 352 F. App’x 611, 613-14 (3d Cir. 2009)
(upholding disclosure of detainee’s recorded telephone conversations by
Marshals Service to government case agent, who disclosed recording to

agencies for ‘court-related purposes’ including ‘civil court actions’”);

foreign customs officials likewise involved in investigation of possible
infractions of foreign tax and customs laws was “permitted by the ‘routine
use’ exception and d[id] not constitute a violation of the Privacy Act”);
Little v. FBI, 793 F. Supp. 652, 655 (D. Md. 1992) (finding that disclosure
did not violate Privacy Act prohibition because it was made pursuant to
routine use that allows disclosure of personnel matters to other
government agencies when directly related to enforcement function of
recipient agency), aff’d on other grounds, 1 F.3d 255 (4th Cir. 1993).
The courts have found, however, that a disclosure does not fall within a
compatible routine use if the agency is not sharing with a law
enforcement agency in the context of an investigation or prosecution,
there is no possible violation of law, or the law enforcement agency head
has not specifically requested the record in writing. For example, a
disclosure is not compatible if it is made to agencies other than the
appropriate ones. See Dick v. Holder, 67 F. Supp. 3d 167, 179 (D.D.C.
2014) (holding that FBI’s disclosure of information to law enforcement
agencies was not compatible with routine use because information “was
not disseminated just to ‘appropriate Federal, State, or local agenc[ies]’”).
Similarly, disclosures are not compatible with a routine use if the record
does not reveal a potential violation of law. In Covert, 667 F. Supp. at 73639, the District Court for the Eastern District of Washington held that a
routine use permitting the Department of Energy’s Inspector General to
disclose to the DOJ relevant records when “a record” indicates a potential
violation of law did not permit the disclosure of personnel security
questionnaires submitted by the plaintiffs because such questionnaires, on
their face, did not reveal potential violations of law. The court rejected the
agency’s argument that disclosure was proper because each questionnaire
was disclosed as part of a prosecutive report that (when viewed as a
whole) did reveal a potential violation of law. Id. at 736-37. Further, the
court found that the Inspector General’s disclosure of the questionnaires
to the DOJ (for a criminal fraud prosecution) was not compatible with the
purpose for which they originally were collected by the Department of
Energy (for a security-clearance eligibility determination),
notwithstanding the fact that the Inspector General subsequently acquired
the questionnaires – on an intra-agency “need to know” basis pursuant to
5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(1) – for the purpose of a fraud investigation. Id. at 73739.
On cross-appeals, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment on other grounds. Covert,

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

876 F.2d at 754-56. The panel majority held that the Department of
Energy’s failure to provide actual notice of the routine use on the
questionnaires at the time of original collection, under subsection
(e)(3)(C), precluded the Department of Energy from later invoking that
routine use under subsection (b)(3). Id. at 755-56; see also Puerta v. HHS,
No. 99-55497, 2000 WL 863974, at *1-2 (9th Cir. June 28, 2000) (following
Covert but finding that agency had provided notice of routine use on
form used to collect information), aff’g No. EDCV 94-0148, slip op. at 7
(C.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 1999); USPS, 9 F.3d at 146 (citing Covert with approval
and remanding case for factual determination as to whether subsection
(e)(3)(C) notice was given); Stafford, 437 F. Supp. 2d at 1119-20 (adhering
to Covert and finding that SSA notified plaintiff of potential uses “on
three occasions when collecting her information,” even though these
notifications were non-specific references to the Federal Register);
Pontecorvo, No. 00-1511, slip op. at 12 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2001) (stating that
agency must comply with subsection (e)(3)(C) “in order to substantiate an
exception for ‘routine use’”). Prior to Covert, no other court had required
actual notice. See the additional discussion under “5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3) Notice Requirements,” below.
Since Krohn v. DOJ, agencies have narrowed the scope of their routine use
disclosures during legal proceedings, disclosing only records “arguably relevant
to the litigation.”
Although initially agencies published broad routine uses, they have been
narrowed since the District Court for the District of Columbia issued its
decision in Krohn v. DOJ, No. 78-1536, slip op. at 4-7 (D.D.C. Mar. 19,
1984). In Krohn, the court invalidated an FBI routine use allowing for
“dissemination [of records] during appropriate legal proceedings,”
finding that such a routine use was impermissibly “vague” and was
“capable of being construed so broadly as to encompass all legal
proceedings.” In response to Krohn, OMB issued guidance to agencies in
which it suggested a model routine use – employing a “relevant and
necessary to the litigation” standard – to permit the public filing of
protected records with a court. OMB Bedell Memo, https://www.justice
.gov/paoverview_omb-85. Many agencies, including the DOJ, have
adopted “post-Krohn” routine uses designed to authorize the public filing
of relevant records in court. See, e.g., 66 Fed. Reg. 36,593, 36,594 (July 12,
2001) (routine use [number 7] applicable to records in DOJ’s “Civil
Division Case File System”); 63 Fed. Reg. 8,666, 8,667-68 (Feb. 20, 1998)
(routine uses [letters “o” and “p”] applicable to records in U.S. Attorney’s
Office’s “Civil Case Files”).

The “post-Krohn” routine uses, such as the ones cited above that employ
an “arguably relevant to the litigation” standard, have withstood
challenges in the courts. See, e.g., Jackson v. FBI, No. 02-C-3957, 2007 WL
2492069, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 28, 2007) (allowing U.S. Attorney’s filing in
court of plaintiff’s unsuccessful application for FBI employment during
pendency of plaintiff’s Title VII suit because application was “at the very
heart of his civil suit”); Russell v. GSA, 935 F. Supp. 1142, 1145-46 (D.
Colo. 1996) (finding disclosure in public pleadings of information
regarding investigation of plaintiff was permissible under routine use
providing for disclosure in proceeding before court where agency is party
and records are determined “to be arguably relevant to the litigation”);
Osborne v. USPS, No. 94-30353, slip op. at 6-9 (N.D. Fla. May 18, 1995)
(holding on alternative ground that disclosure of plaintiff’s injurycompensation file to retired employee who had prepared file and who
had been subpoenaed by plaintiff and was expecting to be deposed on
matters documented in file was proper pursuant to routine use providing
for disclosures “incident to litigation” and “in a proceeding before a
court” because “deposition was a proceeding before [the] Court”); Sheptin
v. DOJ, No. 91-2806, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6221, at *6-7 (D.D.C. Apr. 30,
1992) (finding no wrongful disclosure where agency routine uses permit
use of presentence report during course of habeas proceeding). Such
challenges could arise from an argument that the routine use does not
satisfy the “compatibility” requirement of subsection (a)(7) of the Act, cf.
Britt, 886 F.2d at 547-50 (holding mere “relevance” to recipient entity is
improper standard for “compatible” routine use disclosure).
Courts generally have held that routine use disclosures to further an
investigation or enabled the receiving or disclosing agency to fulfill its mission
are “compatible” disclosures under the routine use disclosure exception.
The courts generally have found that disclosing information is pursuant
to a compatible routine use when the information furthered an
investigation or enabled either agency to fulfill its mission. See, e.g.,
Taylor v. United States, 106 F.3d 833, 836-37 (8th Cir. 1997) (finding

Actual Notice
The Ninth and D.C. Circuits also require that an agency give actual notice
to an individual at the time the information is collected in accordance with
the notice requirements of subsection (e)(3)(C). Covert, 876 F.2d at 754756; USPS v. Nat’l Ass’n of Letter Carriers, 9 F.3d at 140; accord Puerta v.

No. EDCV 94-0148, slip op. at 7 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 1999); cf. Stafford v. SSA,
437 F. Supp. 2d 1113, 1119-20 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (adhering to Covert and
finding that SSA notified plaintiff of potential uses “on three occasions
when collecting her information”; explaining that notice need not
“anticipate and list every single potential permutation of a routine use in
order to invoke this exception”; and stating, “The Court is not persuaded
that Congress intended to place such an impractical burden on federal
agencies, which would in effect severely curtail the very exception that
Congress sought to carve out in the interest of practicality.”). The Court
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cited this aspect of Covert with approval
and remanded a case for determination of whether (e)(3)(C) notice was
provided, stating that “[a]lthough the statute itself does not provide, in so
many terms, that an agency’s failure to provide employees with actual
notice of its routine uses would prevent a disclosure from qualifying as a
‘routine use,’ that conclusion seems implicit in the structure and purpose
of the Act.” USPS v. Nat’l Ass’n of Letter Carriers, 9 F.3d at 146; see also
Minshew v. Donley, 911 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1073 (D. Nev. 2012) (“While a
report to a non-federal employer falls within a routine use, Air Force has
failed to respond to [plaintiff’s] argument that OPM did not inform

[plaintiff] on the form which OPM used to collect the information, or on a
separate form provided to [plaintiff], that [plaintiff’s] federal employer
may make unsolicited disclosures to private employers regarding the
circumstances surrounding [plaintiff’s] separation from federal
employment.”). But cf. Thompson v. State, 400 F. Supp. 2d 1, 16-17
(D.D.C. 2005) (discussed below under Agency Requirements, “5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(e)(3) - Inform Individuals when Asking to Collect Information”).
Additional Routine Use Matters
Some, but not all, courts of appeals have required agencies to invoke the routine
use disclosure exception to disclose certain records to unions.
Four courts have required an agency to invoke a routine use to permit
disclosure to unions of names of employees on the theory that refusal to
so disclose was an unfair labor practice under the National Labor
Relations Act. See NLRB v. USPS, No. 92-2358, 1994 WL 47743, at *3-4
(4th Cir. Feb. 16, 1994); NLRB v. USPS, 888 F.2d 1568, 1572-73 (11th Cir.
1989); NLRB v. USPS, 841 F.2d 141, 144-45 & n.3 (6th Cir. 1988); NLRB v.
USPS, 790 F. Supp. 31, 33 (D.D.C. 1992); see also USPS v. Nat’l Ass’n of
Letter Carriers, 9 F.3d at 141-46 (holding that “if the Postal Service could
disclose the information under [its routine use] then it must disclose that
information, because in the absence of a Privacy Act defense the
arbitrator’s award must be enforced,” but remanding case for
determination as to whether proper (e)(3)(C) notice was given before
requiring invocation of routine use); FLRA v. Navy, 966 F.2d 747, 761-65
(3d Cir. 1992) (alternative holding) (en banc) (holding that release to union
of home addresses of bargaining unit employees pursuant to routine use
was required under Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act).
But cf. NLRB v. USPS, 660 F.3d 65, 70-72 (1st Cir. 2011) (ruling that USPS
routine use for disclosure “[a]s required by applicable law . . . to a labor
organization” did not require automatic disclosure of aptitude tests to
union because National Labor Relations Act did not require that
disclosure, but instead NLRB was required to balance “the interests of the
Union in the information against the privacy interests of the employees”).
In addition, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in
Air Force v. FLRA, granted enforcement of a Federal Labor Relations
Authority decision requiring the Air Force to disclose to a union a
disciplinary letter that was issued to a bargaining unit employee’s
supervisor. 104 F.3d 1396, 1399, 1401-02 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The court held
that the Federal Labor-Management Relations Statute required disclosure
[111]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

of the letter; that because the “Union’s request f[ell] within the Act’s
‘routine use’ exception, the Privacy Act d[id] not bar disclosure”; and that
the union therefore was entitled to disclosure of the letter. Id. at 1401-02.
The D.C. Circuit has held that the routine use disclosure exception does not
permit disclosures solely based on a federal subpoena, as such disclosures are not
permitted under the court order disclosure exception.
The D.C. Circuit concluded that a routine use for complying with a
subpoena was inconsistent with the Privacy Act. See Doe v. Stephens, 851
F.2d 1457, 1465-67 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding that a VA routine use –
permitting disclosure of records “in order for the VA to respond to and
comply with the issuance of a federal subpoena” – was invalid under the
Administrative Procedure Act because it was inconsistent with the
Privacy Act as interpreted in Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d at 78-84, which
had found that disclosures pursuant to subpoenas were not permitted by
the subsection (b)(11) court-order exception). But cf. Osborne v. USPS,
No. 94-30353, slip op. at 6-9 (N.D. Fla. May 18, 1995) (holding on
alternative ground that disclosure of plaintiff’s injury-compensation file to
retired employee who had prepared file and who had been subpoenaed
by plaintiff and was expecting to be deposed on matters documented in
file was proper pursuant to routine use that “specifically contemplates
that information may be released in response to relevant discovery and
that any manner of response allowed by the rules of the forum may be
employed”).
Notwithstanding the required FOIA disclosure and the consumer reporting
agency disclosure exceptions, the Privacy Act disclosure provision does not
provide for nonconsensual disclosures that are governed by other statutes, and
agencies should rely on the routine use disclosure exception for such disclosures.
The Privacy Act does not provide for nonconsensual disclosures that are
governed by other statutes except for the FOIA (subsection (b)(2)) and the
Debt Collection Act (subsection (b)(12)). See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 653 (2018)
(establishing “Parent Locator Service” and requiring agencies to comply
with requests from HHS for addresses and places of employment of
absent parents “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law”).
Recognizing this difficulty, the OMB 1975 Guidelines advise that
“disclosures, which are in effect congressionally mandated ‘routine uses,’”
should be deemed “routine uses” under subsections (e)(11) and (e)(4)(D).

written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research
or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not
individually identifiable.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(5).
Comment:
OMB guidelines suggest that the statistical research disclosure exception is
intended to reduce the likelihood that agencies utilize statistical records to
“reconstruct” individually identifiable records.
The term “statistical record” is defined in the Act as a record that is not used
[113]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

in making individual determinations. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(6). One might
question whether this exception to subsection (b) is anomalous, because the
information to be released is arguably not a “record,” see 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(a)(4), or a “disclosure,” see 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b), as it is not identifiable
to any individual. The OMB 1975 Guidelines, however, provide a plausible
explanation, stating, “[o]ne may infer from the legislative history and other
portions of the Act that an objective of this provision is to reduce the
possibility of matching and analysis of statistical records with other records
to reconstruct individually identifiable records.” 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,954,

agency which maintains the record specifying the particular portion desired

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought.” 5 U.S.C. §
552a(b)(7).
Comment:
The law enforcement request disclosure exception allows certain disclosures, upon
written request, to another agency or instrumentality for civil or criminal law
enforcement purposes.
This provision allows agencies to disclose records to federal law
enforcement agencies and, “upon receipt of a written request, [to] disclose a
record to another agency or unit of State or local government for a civil or
criminal law enforcement activity.” OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at
28,955, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75.
A request for records under the subsection (b)(7) exception must be for civil
or criminal law enforcement purposes. See United States v. Collins, 596 F.2d
166, 169 (6th Cir. 1979) (holding, among other reasons, disclosure of reports
authored by someone suspected of fraud satisfied criminal law enforcement
activity disclosure condition); SEC v. Dimensional Entm’t Corp., 518 F.
Supp. 773, 774-75, 777 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (finding disclosure was proper
because SEC asked Parole Commission to release transcript in question for
purpose of assisting SEC with its attempt to secure injunctive relief against
defendant after SEC presented evidence that defendant will likely continue
his unlawful activity).
While the head of the agency or instrumentality must generally make the written
request for the law enforcement request disclosure exception, agencies may, when
necessary, delegate this responsibility to officials no lower than the “section chief”
level.
The request must be submitted in writing and generally must be from the
head of the agency or instrumentality. See Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74, 85
(D.C. Cir. 1985) (concluding that VA’s disclosure of veteran’s medical
records in response to federal grand jury subpoena was not authorized
because federal grand jury subpoena is issued by federal prosecutors, not
head of an agency); Doe v. Naval Air Station, 768 F.2d 1229, 1233 (11th Cir.
1985) (“[E]xemption (b)(7) requires a written request for disclosure by the
head of the agency making such request to the agency which maintains the
record.”); see also Reyes v. Supervisor of DEA, 834 F.2d 1093, 1095 (1st Cir.
1987) (noting the record lacked an indication that FBI, United States
Probation Office, AUSA, and BOP made a written request for records);

Record-requesting authority may be delegated to lower-level agency
officials when necessary, but not below the “section chief” level. The
Department of Justice has delegated record-requesting authority to the
“head of a component or a United States Attorney, or either’s designee.” 28

would be—
…

the health or safety of an individual if upon such disclosure notification is
transmitted to the last known address of such individual.” 5 U.S.C. §
552a(b)(8).
Comment:
Under this exception, agencies may disclose records under emergency
conditions that affect an individual’s health or safety. See Schwarz v.

services to investigate possible child abuse); Schwarz v. Treasury, 131 F.
Supp. 2d 142, 146-47 (D.D.C. 2000) (citing and agreeing with Schwarz v.
INTERPOL), aff’d, No. 00-5453, 2001 WL 67463 (D.C. Cir. May 10, 2001);

such valid life and death situations as an airplane crash or epidemic”).
OMB guidelines, in apparent conflict with the text of the health or safety disclosure
exception, states that the individual on whom the record pertains “need not
necessarily be the individual whose health or safety is at peril.”
According to OMB 1975 Guidelines, the individual about whom records are
disclosed “need not necessarily be the individual whose health or safety is at
peril; e.g., release of dental records on several individuals in order to
identify an individual who was injured in an accident.” 40 Fed. Reg. at
28,955, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (unsubstantiated
allegations that fail to be “compelling circumstances” also fail to justify the
release of records to an individual who requested disclosure but who is not
the subject of the records). This construction, while sensible as a policy
matter, appears to conflict with the actual wording of subsection (b)(8),
although the wording of this provision is not precise.

The congressional disclosure exception does not authorize the disclosure of a record

would be—
…
(11) pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.” 5 U.S.C. §
552a(b)(11).
Comment:
The Privacy Act does not prohibit the disclosure of relevant records during
discovery when disclosed consistent with the Privacy Act’s disclosure provision;
agencies frequently utilize the court order disclosure exception during discovery.
Subsection (b)(11) permits a court of competent jurisdiction to order
disclosure of Privacy Act protected information that would otherwise be
prohibited from disclosure without prior written consent of the individual
to whom the record pertains.
As a general proposition, the Privacy Act does not act as a shield against
discovery of relevant records that are otherwise protected under the Privacy
Act, and the records may become discoverable through litigation if ordered
by a court. Laxalt v. McClatchy, 809 F.2d 885 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The essential
point of this exception is that the Privacy Act “cannot be used to block the
normal course of court proceedings, including court-ordered discovery.”

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The court order disclosure exception does not, itself, confer federal jurisdiction or
create a right of action to obtain a court order.
Nor does this exception confer federal jurisdiction or create a right of action
to obtain a court order for the disclosure of records. See Sheetz v. Marti, No.
10-10844, 2010 WL 2034775, at *1 (D. Mass. May 19, 2010) (stating that “in
the absence of federal question jurisdiction . . . , diversity jurisdiction . . . , or
some other statutory grant of jurisdiction, this court lacks authority to issue
a subpoena” against federal agency for records plaintiff sought in
connection with his divorce proceedings); Haydon Bros. Contracting, Inc. v.
SSA, No. 7:11-96, 2012 WL 38608, at *2-4 (E.D. Ky. Jan. 9, 2012) (stating that
where plaintiff was seeking (b)(11) order to require agency to disclose third
party’s records, “the Privacy Act permits disclosure of an individual’s
records pursuant to a court order, it does not provide expressly for a private
right of action to obtain such an order,” and “implying a civil remedy. . .is
not consistent with the legislative scheme of the Privacy Act.”); see also
Bryant v. SSA, No. 14CV5764, 2015 WL 6758094, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5,
2015).
Relevant case law focuses on two aspects of the court order disclosure exception:
what constitutes an “order of a court,” and what constitutes a court of “competent
jurisdiction.”
This (b)(11) court order exception – like the subsection (b)(3) routine use
exception – has generated a great deal of uncertainty due to its lack of
guidance on what constitutes an “order of a court” and a “court of
competent jurisdiction.” Unfortunately, neither the Act’s legislative history
nor the OMB 1975 Guidelines shed light on either of these meanings or
illuminate whether there are specific requirements one must meet to rely on
this exception. The relevant case law below provides guidance on both
prongs of this exception, however: 1) the meaning of “order of a court” and
2) when a court has “competent jurisdiction.” See 120 Cong. Rec. at 36,959,

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Meaning of “Court Order”
Judge Approved
Courts have generally interpreted the court order disclosure exception to
require the “order of a court” to be specifically approved by a judge.
To constitute a court order under subsection (b)(11), a judge must
approve the order. In Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74, 77-85 (D.C. Cir.
1985), the D.C. Circuit decisively ruled that a subpoena routinely issued
by a court clerk – such as a federal grand jury subpoena – is not a “court
order” within the meaning of this exception because it is not
“specifically approved” by a judge. Cf. Ricoma v. Standard Fire Ins.
Co., No. 5:12-CV-18, 2013 WL 1164499, at *1 n.2 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 20, 2013)
(finding proposed subpoena deficient on other grounds and discussing
request for subpoena to be signed by judge in accordance with
subsection (b)(11)); Hoffman v. Astrue, No. 3:10-CV-00214, 2011 WL
195617, at *4 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 18, 2011) (ruling that agency need not
comply with state court subpoena to disclose records because all 12
exceptions under Privacy Act are “inapposite”).
Prior to Doe v. DiGenova, the courts were split on this point. Compare
Bruce v. United States, 621 F.2d 914, 916 (8th Cir. 1980) (dictum)
(finding subpoena is not court order), and Stiles v. Atlanta Gas Light
Co., 453 F. Supp. 798, 800 (N.D. Ga. 1978) (finding that Privacy Act will
prevent disclosure of subpoenaed documents unless “the court
specifically orders them produced pursuant to section 552a(b)(11)”),
with Adams v. United States Lines, No. 80-0952, slip op. at 2-3 (E.D. La.
Mar. 16, 1981) (finding subpoena is court order). Cf. Moore v. USPS,
609 F. Supp. 681, 682 (E.D.N.Y. 1985) (finding subpoena is court order
where it is required to be approved by judge under state law).
Note that an agency cannot avoid the result in Doe v. DiGenova by
relying on a routine use that seeks to authorize disclosure pursuant to a
subpoena. See Doe v. Stephens, 851 F.2d 1457, 1465-67 (D.C. Cir. 1988)
(discussed in detail above under exception, “5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) Routine Uses”).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Standards for Issuance of a Court Order
Because the Privacy Act’s court order disclosure exception contains no
standard that governs the issuance of a court order, courts have relied on a
number of considerations, with varying degrees of clarity.
Under the Privacy Act’s subsection (b)(11) exception, there is no
standard governing the issuance of a “court order.” Unlike other
federal privacy-related or confidentiality statutes, subsection (b)(11)
contains no standard governing the issuance of an order authorizing the
disclosure of otherwise protected Privacy Act information. See, e.g., 42
U.S.C. § 290dd-2 (2018) (listing “good cause” factors to be weighed by
court in evaluating applications for orders permitting disclosure of
records pertaining to substance abuse); 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(2)(B)
(prohibiting disclosure unless, inter alia, “information is furnished in
compliance with a judicial order, or pursuant to any lawfully issued
subpoena, upon condition that parents and the students are notified of
all such orders or subpoenas in advance of the compliance therewith by
the educational institution or agency”).
However, there are a number of considerations that the courts have
used, with varying degrees of clarity, to assess whether a “court order”
was issued. These considerations include:
a) Qualified Discovery Privilege
The Privacy Act does not create heightened discovery requirements.
Some courts have held, for example, that because the Privacy Act
does not itself create a qualified discovery “privilege,” a showing of
“need” is not a prerequisite to initiating discovery of protected
records. See Laxalt v. McClatchy, 809 F.2d 885, 888-90 (D.C. Cir.
1987); see also Weahkee v. Norton, 621 F.2d 1080, 1082 (10th Cir.
1980) (noting that objection to discovery of protected records “does
not state a claim of privilege”); CFPB v. Navient Corp., No. 3:17-CV101, 2018 WL 3824367 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 10, 2018) (agreeing “with the
numerous courts that have found that the Privacy Act does not
create a qualified discovery privilege); Bowden-Walker v. Wal-Mart,
No. 3:14-cv-917, 2015 WL 13450672 (S.D. Miss. July 22, 2015); Ala. &
Gulf Coast Ry., LLC v. United States, No. CA 10-0352, 2011 WL
1838882, at *3-5 (S.D. Ala. May 13, 2011) (citing Laxalt in
determining relevance of personnel files); Bosaw v. NTEU, 887 F.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Supp. 1199, 1215-17 (S.D. Ind. 1995) (citing Laxalt with approval,
although ultimately determining that court did not have jurisdiction
to rule on merits of case); Ford Motor Co. v. United States, 825 F.
Supp. 1081, 1083 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1993) (“[T]he Privacy Act does not
establish a qualified discovery privilege that requires a party
seeking disclosure under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(11) to prove that its need
for the information outweighs the privacy interest of the individual
to whom the information relates.”); Clavir v. United States, 84 F.R.D.
612, 614 (“[It] has never been suggested that the Privacy Act was
intended to serve as a limiting amendment to . . . the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure.”); cf. Baldrige v. Shapiro, 455 U.S. 345, 360-62
(1981) (holding that Census Act constitutes statutorily created
discovery “privilege” because it precludes all disclosure of raw
census data despite need demonstrated by litigant).
b) Relevance
The D.C. Circuit has held that the only test for discovery of records is a
“relevance” standard, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Laxalt v. McClatchy establishes that
the only test for discovery of Privacy Act-protected records is
“relevance” under Rule 26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. 809 F.2d at 888-90; see also, e.g., Pa. v. Navient Corp.,

disputed records and requiring parties to resolve potential burden,

c) Balancing Need for Information and Potential Harm
Other courts have assessed court orders by balancing the potential harm to
the affected party from disclosure without restrictions and the requesting
party’s need for the record.
Courts have also assessed whether orders should be granted by
balancing the potential harm to the affected party from disclosure
without restrictions and the need of the requesting party for the
particular information. See Perry v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 734
F.2d 1441, 1447 (11th Cir. 1984) (asserting that requests for court
orders “should be evaluated by balancing the need for the disclosure
against the potential harm to the subject of the disclosure”);
Pearlstein v. BlackBerry Ltd., No. 19-mc-91091, 2019 WL 6117145 (D.
Mass. Nov. 18, 2019) (concluding that compelling disclosure without

notice, and without consideration of privacy interests of named
individuals, ran afoul of privacy interests of individuals in
nondisclosure of documents); Romeo v. Israel, No. 13-CV-61411,
2016 WL 3646858, at *2-6 (S.D. Fla. June 28, 2016) (balancing need for
disclosure of information with potential harm to subjects of
disclosure and determining that information was relevant, but in
order to protect interests of individuals in case, documents would be
reviewed in camera and only produced what is relevant to matter);

2013 WL 5816632, at *2 (D. Idaho Oct. 28, 2013) (finding that either
standard of “relevancy” or standard “balancing the need for the
disclosure against the potential harm to the subject of the
disclosure” was met and that harm to third-parties is limited since
request is “narrowly circumscribed to involve only their
performance reviews and documents pertaining to any investigation
surrounding their termination” and that protective order would
ensure confidentiality of information); Hall v. Hous. Auth. of Cnty.
of Marin, No. 12-04922, 2013 WL 5695813, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 18,
2013) (finding that plaintiffs’ need for information to support claim
seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for alleged violations of the
U.S. Housing Act “outweighs any privacy interests, especially in
light of the Protective Order and other steps, such as redaction, that
can be taken to reduce privacy concerns”); Gutierrez v. Benavides,
292 F.R.D. 401, 404-06 (S.D. Tex. 2013) (finding that “in determining
whether to grant a protective order, the court must balance the
requesting party’s need for the information against the injury that
might result if uncontrolled disclosure if compelled” and “[t]hrough
this balancing process, courts should afford due weight to the
affected party’s privacy interest”; and determining that personnel
records of federal employees other than “‘records indicating official
misconduct, abuse of power, or constitutional violations’ are to be
protected from public disclosure”); Am. Modern Select Ins. Co. v.

although court was “authorized to order discovery of confidential

disclosure against the benefits of providing relevant evidence”);
Newman, No. 81-2480, slip op. at 3 (D.D.C. Sept. 13, 1982)
(evaluating “legitimacy” of discovery requests and “need” for
records as factors governing issuance of court order); cf. Hounshel v.
Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC, No. 4:11-CV-00635, 2013 WL 5375833,
at *2 (D. Idaho Sept. 24, 2013) (finding that “[r]esolution of a privacy
objection requires a balancing of the need for the information sought
against the privacy right asserted” and granting limited order
allowing plaintiff access to third-party mental health records of
employees of defendant); Ibrahim v. DHS, No. 06-00545, 2013 WL
1703367, at 6 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 19, 2013) (ordering disclosure under
protective order and stating that “government may redact
documents only to remove information relating to third parties who
are private individuals and who are unrelated to plaintiff and her
claims (relating to her challenge of being placed on government
watch lists”). But cf. FDK Am., Inc. v. United States, 973 F. Supp. 2d
1315, 1318 (Ct. Int’l Trade Apr. 4, 2014) (holding motion for
protective order in abeyance pending plaintiff’s certification of
identity of third party who had control of documents plaintiff
sought; subsequent determination of whether third-party provides
consent, or was located outside territorial jurisdiction of the court).
Limiting Discovery with Protective Order
Courts have held that a protective order limiting discovery under the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure is a proper procedural device for protecting records
under the court order disclosure exception.
It is important to note that a protective order limiting discovery under
Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (based, if appropriate,
upon a court’s careful in-camera inspection) is a proper procedural
device for protecting particularly sensitive Privacy Act-protected
records when subsection (b)(11) court orders are sought. See Laxalt, 809
F.2d at 889-90; see also, e.g., Noble v. City of Fresno, No.
116CV01690DADBAM, 2017 WL 5665850, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 27, 2017)
(stating that Defendant’s concerns could be assuaged by “tightly
drawn” protective order specifying specific access and uses of
information); Upstate Shredding, LLC v. Northeastern Ferrous, Inc.,

Court Orders for Publicly Filing Protected Records with Courts
Agencies may affirmatively disclose Privacy Act-protected records during
litigation, so long as the disclosure is made in accordance with the Privacy
Act’s disclosure provision.
As noted above, the Act’s legislative history indicates that a court is not
a “person” or “agency” within the meaning of subsection (b), and that
the Act was “not designed to interfere with access to information by the
courts.” 120 Cong. Rec. at 36,967, reprinted in Source Book at 958-59,

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

during the course of litigation without consent of the subject of the
records, by definition the disclosure constitutes a subsection (b)
disclosure. See Laningham v. Navy, No. 83-3238, slip op. at 2-3 (D.D.C.
Sept. 25, 1984), summary judgment granted (D.D.C. Jan. 7, 1985), aff’d
per curiam, 813 F.2d 1236 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (concluding that because
court had issued an order allowing the Navy to file documents, Navy
had “grounds for believing its actions lawful” pursuant to section
552a(b)(11)). Thus, such public filing is proper only if it is undertaken
pursuant to: (1) the subsection (b)(3) routine use exception (previously
discussed), or (2) the subsection (b)(11) court order exception.
Where the routine use exception is unavailable, an agency should
obtain a subsection (b)(11) court order permitting such public filing. Cf.
DiGenova, 779 F.2d at 85 n.20 (“This is not to say that a prosecutor, a
defendant, or a civil litigant, cannot submit an in camera ex parte
application for a [subsection (b)(11)] court order.”). However, in light
of Laningham, agencies should take care to apprise the court of the
Privacy Act-related basis for seeking the order. In Laningham, the
district court ruled that the government’s nonconsensual disclosure of
plaintiff’s “disability evaluation” records to the United States Claims
Court was improper – even though such records were filed only after
the agency’s motion for leave to file “out of time” was granted. Id. The
court held that subsection (b)(11) applies only when “for compelling
reasons, the court specifically orders that a document be disclosed,” and
it rejected the agency’s argument that the exception applies whenever
records happen to be filed with leave of court. Id. at 4.
The Court of Veterans Appeals has issued a “standing order” that permits the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to routinely file relevant records from veterans’
case files.
One unique solution to the problem of filing Privacy Act-protected
records in court is illustrated by In re A Motion for a Standing Order, in
which the Court of Veterans Appeals issued a “standing order”
permitting the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to routinely file relevant
records from veterans’ case files in all future proceedings with that
court. 1 Vet. App. 555, 558-59 (Ct. Vet. App. 1990) (per curiam); cf.
Perkins v. United States, No. 99-3031, 2001 WL 194928, at *3 (D.D.C.
Feb. 21, 2001) (order) (authorizing parties to seek admission into
evidence at trial of any materials subject to the court’s stipulated
protective order pursuant to subsection (b)(11)).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Meaning of “Competent Jurisdiction”
The D.C. Circuit has equated the term “competent jurisdiction” with “personal
jurisdiction.”
One of the few Privacy Act decisions to mention this oft-overlooked
“competent jurisdiction” requirement is Laxalt v. McClatchy. 809 F.2d at
890-91. In that case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit appeared to equate the term “competent jurisdiction” with
“personal jurisdiction” and noted that the requests for discovery of the
nonparty agency’s records “were within the jurisdiction of the District
Court for the District of Columbia” as “[n]either party contends that the
District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the FBI’s custodian of
records.” Id.
Of course, where an agency is a proper party in a federal case, the district
court’s personal jurisdiction over the agency presumably exists, and thus,
court-ordered discovery of the agency’s records is proper under
subsection (b)(11).
However, where a party seeks discovery of a nonparty agency’s records
pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum issued under Rule 45 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, Laxalt suggests that the district court issuing the
discovery order must have personal jurisdiction over the nonparty agency
in order to be regarded as a court of “competent jurisdiction” within the
meaning of subsection (b)(11). See 809 F.2d at 890-91; cf. Mason v. S. Bend
Cmty. Sch. Corp., 990 F. Supp. 1096, 1097-99 (N.D. Ind. 1997) (determining
that SSA’s regulations “generally do not authorize the release of . . .
records upon order of a court, even a federal court, in the absence of a
special circumstance as defined by the statutes and regulations,” and thus,
finding SSA not to be in contempt of court for failure to comply with prior
order compelling SSA, a nonparty, to produce documents). But cf.
Lohrenz v. Donnelly, 187 F.R.D. 1, 8-9 (D.D.C. 1999) (finding that
nonparty agency made requisite showing of good cause for court to enter
protective order without discussing jurisdiction over nonparty agency).
The issue of whether personal jurisdiction exists in this situation is not
always clear – particularly where the nonparty agency’s records are kept
at a place beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the district court that issued
the discovery order. Indeed, this very issue was apparently raised but not
decided in Laxalt, 809 F.2d at 890-91 (finding it unnecessary to decide
whether federal district court in Nevada would have had jurisdiction to
order discovery of FBI records located in District of Columbia).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Some, but not all, courts have held that state courts lack “competent jurisdiction”
when issuing state court orders for the disclosure of a nonparty federal agency’s
records.
Likewise, the existence of “competent jurisdiction” is questionable
whenever a state court orders the disclosure of a nonparty federal
agency’s records because the doctrine of “sovereign immunity” will
ordinarily preclude state court jurisdiction over a federal agency or
official. See, e.g., Boron Oil Co. v. Downie, 873 F.2d 67, 70-71 (4th Cir.
1989) (holding state court subpoena constitutes “action” against United
States and thus sovereign immunity applied even though EPA was not
party in suit); Bosaw, 887 F. Supp. at 1210-17 (finding state court lacked
jurisdiction to order federal officers to produce documents because
government did not explicitly waive its sovereign immunity and, because
federal court’s jurisdiction in this case was derivative of state court’s
jurisdiction, federal court was likewise barred from ordering officers to
produce documents); Sharon Lease Oil Co. v. FERC, 691 F. Supp. 381, 38385 (D.D.C. 1988) (holding state court subpoena quashed as state court
lacked jurisdiction to compel nonparty federal official to testify or
produce documents absent waiver of sovereign immunity); see also
Moore v. Armour Pharm. Co., 129 F.R.D. 551, 555 (N.D. Ga. 1990) (citing
additional cases on point); cf. Louisiana v. Sparks, 978 F.2d 226, 235 n.15
(5th Cir. 1992) (noting that “[t]here is no indication that [subsection
(b)(11)] evinces congressional intent to broadly waive the sovereign
immunity of [federal] agencies . . . when ordered to comply with state
court subpoenas”); Longtin v. DOJ, No. 06-1302, 2006 WL 2223999, at *2-3
(D.D.C. Aug. 3, 2006) (citing Sparks, rejecting plaintiff’s argument that
subsection (b)(11) is a “sweeping waiver of sovereign immunity”, and
concluding that “neither the Superior Court of the District of Columbia
nor the Circuit Court for Prince George’s County, Maryland constitute[s]
a ‘court of competent jurisdiction’ . . . to issue an order compelling a
federal official to comply with a state court subpoena”).
Nevertheless, in Robinett v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., No. 02-0842,
2002 WL 31498992, at *3-4 (E.D. La. Nov. 7, 2002), aff’d per curiam, 83 F.
App’x 638 (5th Cir. 2003), the district court looked to subsection (b)(11)
and held that State Farm “properly obtained” an order from the state
court for release of plaintiff’s medical records where “plaintiff’s medical
condition was relevant to the litigation.” The court upheld the
Department of Veterans Affairs’ “determination that plaintiff’s records
were subject to release based on the court order.” In upholding the
district court’s decision, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
[132]

specifically stated that the medical records were “released pursuant to the
exception for orders of a court of competent jurisdiction contained in 5
U.S.C. § 552a(b)(11).” 83 F. App’x at 639; see also Moore v. USPS, 609 F.
Supp. 681, 682 (E.D.N.Y. 1985) (assuming without explanation that state
court subpoena, required by state law to be approved by judge,
constituted proper subsection (b)(11) court order; issue of “competent
jurisdiction” was not addressed).
In addition, at least one state court has ruled that it has “competent
jurisdiction” to issue a subsection (b)(11) court order permitting the
disclosure of a Privacy Act-protected record. Tootle v. Seaboard Coast
Line R.R., 468 So. 2d 237, 239 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984); cf. Saulter v. Mun.
Court for the Oakland-Piedmont Judicial Dist., 142 Cal. App. 3d 266, 275
(Cal. Ct. App. 1977) (suggesting that state court can order state prosecutor
to subpoena federal records for purpose of disclosing them to criminal
defendant in discovery).
Agencies that construe state court orders as providing authority to
disclose under subsection (b)(11) should be aware that compliance with
such an order might be taken by a court as acquiescence to the court’s
jurisdiction, notwithstanding applicable principles of sovereign
immunity.

12. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(12) - Debt Collection Act
“No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of
records…except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written
consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless the disclosure
would be—
…
(12) to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with section 3711(e) of
Title 31.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(12).
Comment:
This disclosure exception was added to the original eleven exceptions by the
Debt Collection Act of 1982. It authorizes agencies to disclose bad-debt
information to credit bureaus. 31 U.S.C. § 3711(e)(9)(F). Before doing so,
however, agencies must complete a series of due process steps designed to
validate the debt and to offer the individual an opportunity to repay it. See

ACCOUNTING OF CERTAIN DISCLOSURES
“Each agency, with respect to each system of records under its control, shall-(1) except for disclosures made under subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, keep
an accurate accounting of-(A) the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to any
person or to another agency made under subsection (b) of this section; and
(B) the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is
made;
(2) retain the accounting made under paragraph (1) of this subsection for at least five
years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the
accounting is made;
(3) except for disclosures made under subsection (b)(7) of this section, make the
accounting made under paragraph (1) of this subsection available to the individual
named in the record at his request; and
(4) inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute
made by the agency in accordance with subsection (d) of this section of any record
that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was
made.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(c)(1)-(4).
Comment:
With the exception of the need to know disclosure and the required FOIA disclosure
exceptions, agencies are required to keep accurate accountings of their record disclosures.
Section 552a(c) of the Privacy Act establishes requirements for agencies to follow
when accounting for disclosures of records. Subsection (c)(1) explicitly excepts both
intra-agency “need to know” disclosures and FOIA disclosures from its coverage.
See, e.g., Clarkson v. IRS, 811 F.2d 1396, 1397-98 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (finding
IRS’s internal disclosure of records to its criminal investigation units does not require
accounting).
While agencies do not need to account for disclosures made within the agency, the
agency must account for all disclosures made outside of the agency, including
disclosures pursuant to routine uses and law enforcement agencies (even though the
law enforcement agency may be exempt from disclosures to the subject individual).

[hereinafter OMB Memo 99-05], https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-99-05; see
Quinn v. Navy, No. 94-56067, 1995 WL 341513, at *1 (9th Cir. June 8, 1995) (finding
that disclosure of records within the Navy was exempt from accounting
requirements).
OMB guidelines state that an agency must be able to maintain an accurate and complete
accounting of disclosures so as to be able to respond to an individual’s request for access to
that accounting of disclosures.
Additionally, OMB stated that “[w]hile an agency need not keep a running tabulation
of every disclosure at the time it is made, the agency must be able to reconstruct an
accurate and complete accounting of disclosures so as to be able to respond to
requests in a timely fashion.” OMB Memo 99-05, B.2.d.,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-99-05; see also OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40
Fed. Reg. at 28,956, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75. Accounting of
disclosures made outside of the agency is required “even when such disclosure is . . .
with the written consent or at the request of the individual.” OMB 1975 Guidelines,
40 Fed. Reg. at 28,955, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75.
In at least one district court case, the court noted that the records themselves do not need to
contain the required accounting information.
In one case, a district court noted that although an agency is required pursuant to 5
U.S.C. § 552a(c) to keep an accurate accounting of each disclosure, there is no
requirement that the “disclosed records themselves contain ‘the date, nature and
purpose’ of each disclosure.” Sieverding v. DOJ, 693 F. Supp. 2d 93, 105-06 (D.D.C.
2010), summary affirmance granted, No. 13-5060, 2013 WL 6801184 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 11,
2013) (per curiam). The district court also stated that the accounting requirement
only “requires agencies to keep accurate accountings of their disclosures of records;
they need not account for conversations or personal visits.” Id. at 106.
Individuals have a right of access to an accounting of disclosures similar to the access right
provided by subsection (d)(1), but are exempt from accessing such an accounting: (1)
documenting law enforcement request disclosures under subsection (b)(7); and (2) subject to
the Privacy Act exemption provisions, pursuant to subsection (j) or subsection (k).
It is important to recognize that subsection (c)(3) grants individuals a right of access
to the accounting of disclosures similar to the access right provided by subsection
(d)(1). See Standley v. DOJ, 835 F.2d 216, 219 (9th Cir. 1987) (entitling plaintiff to gain
access to list, compiled by U.S. Attorney, of persons in IRS to whom disclosures of

unauthorized disclosures because provisions only cover disclosures made under
subsection (b)), aff’d in part & remanded in part on other grounds, 622 F.3d 540 (6th
Cir. 2010).
However, subsection (c)(3) makes an explicit exception “for disclosures made under

AUSA had properly requested disclosed document from legacy INS because he was
“not entitled to any accounting of disclosures” made under subsection (b)(7)) aff’d
per curiam, 61 F. App’x 80 (4th Cir. 2003).
Of course, it should not be overlooked that certain Privacy Act exemptions – 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(j) and (k) – are potentially available to shield an “accounting of disclosures”
record from release to the subject thereof under subsection (c)(3). See Vazquez v.
DOJ, 764 F. Supp. 2d 117, 120 (D.D.C. 2011) (ruling that “DOJ properly denied

INDIVIDUAL’S RIGHT OF ACCESS
“Each agency that maintains a system of records shall . . . upon request by any
individual to gain access to his record or to any information pertaining to him which
is contained in the system, permit him and upon his request, a person of his own
choosing to accompany him, to review the record and have a copy made of all or any
portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him, except that the agency may require
the individual to furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of that
individual’s record in the accompanying person’s presence.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1).
A. The Privacy Act and the FOIA
Comment:
The Privacy Act and the FOIA are often read in tandem; The Privacy Act allows
individuals to access records about themselves, while the FOIA allows the public to
access government information.
The Privacy Act provides individuals with a means to access government
records about themselves. The right of access under the Privacy Act is similar to
that of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and the statutes do overlap, but
not entirely. Compare 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1) with 5 U.S.C. § 522(a)(3)(A); see
generally Greentree v. U.S. Customs Serv., 674 F.2d 74, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1982)
(“While the Privacy Act was designed to provide individuals with more control
over the gathering, dissemination, and accuracy of agency information about
themselves, FOIA was intended to increase the public’s access to governmental
information.”). The FOIA is entirely an access statute and “is often explained as
a means for citizens to know ‘what their Government is up to.’” NARA v.
Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 171-72 (2004) (quoting DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for
Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989)); see generally FOIA Guide, at 1,
https://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1248371 (FOIA provides that “any person
has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records” that
are not subject to any of its exemptions or exclusions). By comparison, the
Privacy Act permits only an “individual” to seek access to only his own
“record,” and only if that record is maintained by the agency within a “system of
records” – i.e., is retrieved by that individual requester’s name or personal
identifier – subject to ten Privacy Act exemptions (see the discussion “Ten
Exemptions,” below). See Sussman v. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1121 (D.C.
Cir. 2007) (concluding that Privacy Act gives individuals “access only to their
own records, not to all information pertaining to them that happens to be
contained in a system of records”); see also Burton v. Wolf, 803 F. App’x 120, 122
(9th Cir. 2020) (finding that plaintiff was not entitled to records retrievable only

with identifying information of his estranged wife); Aguiar v. DEA, 334 F. Supp.
3d 130, 146 (D.D.C. 2018) (request for information about GPS contractor did not

Goldstein v. IRS, 279 F. Supp. 3d 170, 187 (D.D.C. 2017) (“Plaintiff's Privacy Act
claim fails because the information that Plaintiff seeks … is not ‘about’ him.”).
Thus, the primary difference between the FOIA and the access provision of the
Privacy Act is the scope of information accessible under each statute.
Agencies should consider individuals’ access requests under both the Privacy Act and the
FOIA.
Agencies should process an individuals’ access requests for their own records
maintained in system of records under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA,
regardless of the statute(s) cited. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(t)(1) and (2) (prohibiting

requester the right to administratively appeal any adverse determination that an
agency makes on his or her access request. However, because agencies should
process an individual’s access request under both statutes – which includes
processing the request through any administrative appeal – there is no practical
effect of this distinction. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 16.45 (2020) (explaining DOJ
Privacy Act regulation regarding appeals from denials of requests for access to
records).
B.

FOIA/Privacy Act Interface Examples: Access
Suppose John Q. Citizen writes to Agency: “Please send to me all records that
you have on me.”
For purposes of this example, assume that the only responsive records are
contained in a system of records retrieved by Mr. Citizen’s own name or
personal identifier. Thus, both the Privacy Act and the FOIA potentially apply to
the records.
1.

If No Privacy Act Exemption Applies
Result: Mr. Citizen should receive access to his Privacy Act records where
Agency can invoke no Privacy Act exemption.
The Agency cannot rely upon a FOIA exemption alone to deny Mr. Citizen
access to any of his records under the Privacy Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(t)(1)
(FOIA exemptions cannot defeat Privacy Act access); see also Martin v.
Office of Special Counsel, 819 F.2d 1181, 1184 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“If a FOIA
exemption covers the documents, but a Privacy Act exemption does not, the
documents must be released under the Privacy Act.” (emphasis added));
Hoffman v. Brown, No. 1:96cv53-C, slip op. at 4 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 26, 1996)
(agreeing with plaintiff that “no provision of the Privacy Act allows the
government to withhold or redact records concerning [his] own personnel
records” and ordering production of e-mail and other correspondence
regarding plaintiff’s employment), aff’d, 145 F.3d 1324 (4th Cir. 1998)

In other words, a requester is entitled to the combined total of what both
statutes provide. See Clarkson v. IRS, 678 F.2d 1368, 1376 (11th Cir. 1982);

between FOIA and Privacy Act exemptions “sounds like a sphinxian
riddle,” “[t]he interaction between the two statutes … boils down to a rather
straightforward edict: ‘Where a request for documents is made under both
FOIA and the Privacy Act, the responding agency must demonstrate that the
documents fall within some exemption under each Act.’” (quoting Barouch

If a Privacy Act Exemption Applies
Result: Where a Privacy Act exemption applies, Mr. Citizen is not entitled to
obtain access to his records under the Privacy Act.
But he may still be able to obtain access to his records (or portions thereof)
under the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(t)(2) (Privacy Act exemption(s) cannot
defeat FOIA access); Martin, 819 F.2d at 1184 (“[I]f a Privacy Act exemption
but not a FOIA exemption applies, the documents must be released under
FOIA.”) (emphasis added); Savada v. DOD, 755 F. Supp. 6, 9 (D.D.C. 1991)
(citing Martin and holding that agency must prove that document is exempt
from release under both FOIA and Privacy Act); see also Ehlmann v. DHS,

applied to record, “that statute cannot be used to withhold any record
‘which is otherwise accessible to [an] individual’ under FOIA”); Miller v.
United States, 630 F. Supp. 347, 348-49 (E.D.N.Y. 1986); Nunez v. DEA, 497
F. Supp. 209, 211 (S.D.N.Y. 1980). The outcome will depend upon FOIA
exemption applicability.

If No Privacy Act Exemption and No FOIA Exemption Apply
Result: The information should be disclosed.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

If Both Privacy Act and FOIA Exemptions Apply
Result: The record should be withheld, unless the agency, after careful
consideration, decides to disclose the record to the first-party requester as a
matter of administrative discretion. See Memorandum from Eric Holder,
Attorney General, for Dept. of Justice Heads of Exec. Dept. & Agencies, The
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (Mar. 19, 2009), https://www.justice.gov
/paoverview_agfoia [hereinafter AG FOIA 2009] (encouraging agencies “to
make discretionary disclosures of information” when they may legally do
so).
But remember: When an individual requests access to his own record (i.e., a
first-party request) that is maintained in a system of records, an agency must
be able to invoke properly both a Privacy Act exemption and a FOIA
exemption in order to withhold that record.
Rule: ALL PRIVACY ACT ACCESS REQUESTS SHOULD ALSO BE
TREATED AS FOIA REQUESTS.
Note also that Mr. Citizen’s first-party request – because it is a FOIA request
as well – additionally obligates Agency to search for any records on him that
are not maintained in a Privacy Act system of records. With respect to those
records, only the FOIA’s exemptions are relevant; the Privacy Act’s access
provision and exemptions are entirely inapplicable to any records not
maintained in a system of records.

C.

Records Requests and Searches
The Privacy Act does not require agencies to create records that do not exist.
The Privacy Act – like the FOIA – only requires agencies to search for existing
records; it does not require “an agency to create records that do not exist.”
DeBold v. Stimson, 735 F.2d 1037, 1041 (7th Cir. 1984); Schoenman v. FBI, 764 F.
Supp. 2d 40, 48 (D.D.C. 2011) (reiterating that “agencies are under no obligation
to create or generate records in the course of discharging their obligations under
FOIA and the Privacy Act”); Harter v. IRS, No. 02-00325, 2002 WL 31689533, at *5
(D. Haw. Oct. 16, 2002) (“the Privacy Act does not require that the IRS create
records in response to individual requests”); but see May v. Air Force, 777 F.2d
1012, 1015-17 (5th Cir. 1985) (finding that (k)(7) exemption for protecting source’s
identity is subject to “reasonable segregation requirement” that obligates agency
to create and release typewritten version of handwritten evaluation forms so as

not to reveal identity of evaluator under exemption (k)(7)); cf ACLU v. DHS, 738
F. Supp. 2d 93, 117 (D.D.C. 2010) (concluding in a FOIA case that disclosure was
appropriate where DHS produced typed renditions rather than handwritten
notes).
Individuals must specify the documents requested, and agencies need only search for
records consistent with the request.
Individuals seeking documents pursuant to the Privacy Act must identify with
sufficient specificity the documents requested. Manga v. Knox, No. CV ELH-171207, 2018 WL 3239483, at *12 (D. Md. July 3, 2018) (summarily dismissing a
plaintiff’s claim because “[a]bsent a description of the documents sought, as well
as details of the refusal to turn over the requested information, it is impossible to
determine if [plaintiff] has stated a viable claim.” (quoting Carroll v. SSA, WDQ11-3005, 2012 WL 1454858, at *2 (D. Md. Apr. 24, 2012); Fleischman v. Comm’r of
Soc. Sec., No. 3:15-CV-897-J-PDB, 2016 WL 7474577, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 29,
2016) (plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim was dismissed because he did “not allege the
substance of his request for records with sufficient specificity to indicate whether
his request was proper”); cf. Marshall v. Cuomo, 192 F.3d 473, 485 (4th Cir. 1999)
(affirming dismissal of FOIA claim where plaintiff failed to identify specific
documents requested).
The Privacy Act only requires agencies to conduct a search consistent with the
scope of the request. Ewell v. DOJ, 153 F. Supp. 3d 294, 302-03 (D.D.C. 2016) (the
Privacy Act “does not obligate an agency to conduct a search for all records
relating to a requester where a requester has asked the agency only to look for
certain records”) (emphasis in original).
The Privacy Act, consistent with the FOIA, requires an agency to conduct an adequate
and reasonable search for records.
The standard for determining the adequacy of a search pursuant to the Privacy
Act “is essentially the same” as that under the FOIA, and where the government
satisfied the requirements for a reasonable search under FOIA, it also satisfied
the Privacy Act search requirements. Jackson v. GSA, 267 F. Supp. 3d 617, 624
(E.D. Pa. 2017), aff’d, 729 F. App’x 206 (3d Cir. 2018); Hillier v. CIA, No. CV 16CV-1836, 2018 WL 4354947, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept. 12, 2018).
Under both the Privacy Act and FOIA, an agency must conduct an adequate and
reasonable search for relevant records. For example, the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit applied the FOIA standard to an access claim
brought under the Privacy Act in Chambers v. Interior, 568 F.3d 998, 1003 (D.C.
[144]

Cir. 2009). “In a suit seeking agency documents – whether under the Privacy Act
or FOIA – ‘[a]t the summary judgment stage, where the agency has the burden to
show that it acted in accordance with the statute, the court may rely on a
reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of
search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive
materials (if such records exist) were searched.’” Id. (quoting McCready v.
Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2006), which in turn quotes Valencia-Lucena
v. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C. Cir. 1999), FOIA case addressing agency
adequacy of search obligations); cf. New Orleans Workers’ Ctr. for Racial Justice
v. ICE, 373 F. Supp. 3d 16, 35 (D.D.C. 2019) (discussing adequacy of search in
FOIA context); Schulze v. FBI, No. 1:05-CV-0180, 2010 WL 2902518, at *15 (E.D.
Cal. July 22, 2010) (“While the court is of the opinion that there exists some doubt
that Congress intended that the Privacy Act provide civil remedies for an
agency’s failure to adequately search its files, . . . [t]he court, in the interests of
giving fullest consideration to Plaintiff’s claims, will follow Chambers and apply
FOIA standards to Plaintiff’s failure to search claims to the extent those claims
are asserted under the Privacy Act.”).
An agency’s search obligations “are dictated by whether the scope of the search
is reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Mobley v. CIA, 924
F. Supp. 2d 24, 44 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), aff’d, 806
F.3d 568 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Lane v. Interior, 523 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2008) (“The
search need only be reasonable, and the government may demonstrate that it
undertook an adequate search by producing ‘reasonably detailed, nonconclusory
affidavits submitted in good faith’”) (citation omitted); cf. SAI v. TSA, 315 F.
Supp. 3d 218, 243 (D.D.C. 2018) (failure to uncover records does not mean that
the search was inadequate).
In Chambers, the D.C. Circuit addressed the question of “whether [the agency]
intentionally destroyed the [record sought] after [plaintiff] requested access to
it.” Chambers, 568 F.3d at 1000. The court reversed the district court’s grant of
summary judgment to the agency, reasoning that the agency’s “search would not
be adequate under the Privacy Act if [agency] officials, aware of Chambers’s
document requests, deliberately destroyed her performance appraisal before
completing the search in order to avoid providing the document to her . . . Such
a search would not be ‘reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents’
– which is what the Privacy Act, like FOIA, requires.” Id. at 1005. In remanding
the case back to the district court, the Court of Appeals noted that “should
Chambers prevail on [her access claim], the available remedies may be limited
given that additional searches at this late date would likely prove futile,” but
went on to state that “nonetheless, she may be entitled at a minimum to
‘reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs.’” Id. at 1008. On remand, the

district court concluded that it “need not reach” the question of whether the
agency intentionally destroyed the record at issue because the plaintiff “failed to
sustain her burden of proof” on the question of “whether the document in
question ever existed.” Chambers v. Interior, No. 05-0380, 2010 WL 2293262, at
*2-3 (D.D.C. May 28, 2010).
A reasonably detailed affidavit describing the Privacy Act search can be sufficient to
establish that the search was adequate.
Agencies can generally establish that a search was adequate by submitting “a
reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of
search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive
materials (if such records exist) were searched.” Chambers v. Interior, 568 F.3d
at 1003 (internal citations omitted); see also Elgabrowny v. CIA, No. 17-CV00066, 2019 WL 1440345, at *7-11 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2019) (discussing the adequacy
of several FOIA and Privacy Act requests); Demoruelle v. VA, No. CV 16-00562
LEK-KSC, 2017 WL 2836989, at *6 (D. Haw. June 30, 2017) (finding that whether
requested information actually exists is “immaterial to whether or not the VA’s
search was adequate” where VA provided a “detailed explanation of the records
that it searched, the VA employee(s) who performed the search, and the process
that it used for the search”).
An affidavit describing a FOIA and Privacy Act search is “reasonably detailed” if
it includes “the search terms and the type of search performed, and aver[s] that
all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist) were
searched.” Sandoval v. DOJ, No. CV 16-1013 (ABJ), 2019 WL 316168, at *4
(D.D.C. Jan. 24, 2019) (quoting Oglesby v. Army, 920 F. 2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2010).
On the other hand, agency affidavits that “do not denote which files were
searched, or by whom, do not reflect any systematic approach to document
location, and do not provide information specific enough to enable [the
requester] to challenge the procedures utilized” are insufficient to support
summary judgment. Sandoval v. DOJ, 2019 WL 316168, at *4, (quoting Weisberg
v. DOJ, 627 F.2d 365, 371 (D.C. Cir. 1980)); see also SAI v. TSA, 315 F. Supp. 3d at
246 (concluding that “without evidence regarding the temporal scope” of the
agency’s search, it was “impossible to know whether the search was adequate”
and summary judgment was not appropriate); Defs. of Wildlife v. Border Patrol,
623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 92 (D.D.C. 2009) (finding declaration deficient where it failed
to detail types of files searched, filing methods, and search terms used).

[146]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Agencies have the burden of justifying the withholding of records, and courts review
those decisions de novo.
The Privacy Act places the burden to justify withholding of records on the
agency, and provides for de novo review of decisions to withhold records. See 5
U.S.C. § 552a(g)(3)(A); Louis v. Labor, 419 F.3d 970, 977 (9th Cir. 2005); Becker v.
IRS, 34 F.3d 398, 408 n.26 (7th Cir. 1994); Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d 694, 697–
98 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc); Erwin v. State, 2013 WL 6452758, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Dec.
9, 2013) (finding that “agency bears the burden of establishing that the search
was adequate … [b]ecause of the ‘asymmetrical distribution of knowledge’” in
FOIA and Privacy Act cases “where the agency alone possesses, reviews,
discloses, and withholds the subject matter of the request” (quoting Judicial
Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 146 (D.C. Cir. 2006))). Thus, no deference is
due an agency’s determination of which records to disclose and which are
exempt. Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. 614, 618-19 (2004) (distinguishing de novo review
from “any form of deferential review”).

requests for medical records, see the discussion below under “Agency Rules, 5

Individuals.” For additional information regarding document searches in the
FOIA context, see generally FOIA Guide at 57-58, https://www.justice.gov
/oip/page/file/1199421/download#page=40.
D. Third Party Interests
Courts have split over how to handle records that, if released under the Privacy Act,
would violate a third party’s privacy interests.
A particularly troubling and unsettled problem under the Privacy Act arises
where a file retrieved by the requester’s name or personal identifier contains
information pertaining to a third party that, if released, would invade that third
party’s privacy.
This problem arises only when a requester seeks access to a record contained in a
non-law enforcement system of records – typically a personnel or background
security investigative system – inasmuch as agencies are generally permitted to
exempt the entirety of their criminal and civil law enforcement systems of
records from the subsection (d)(1) access provision pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
§§ 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
The problem stems from the fact that unlike the FOIA, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6),
[147]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

(7)(C), the Privacy Act does not contain any exemption that protects a third
party’s privacy. Cf. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(5) (protecting only confidential sourceidentifying information in background security investigative systems). The
Privacy Act’s access provision simply permits an individual to gain access to “his
record or to any information pertaining to him” that is contained in a system of
records and retrieved by his name or personal identifier. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1).
The courts of appeals that have squarely addressed this issue have reached
different conclusions. Compare Voelker v. IRS, 646 F.2d 332, 333-35 (8th Cir.
1981), with Sussman v. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1120-21 (D.C. Cir. 2007). In
Voelker, the Eighth Circuit held that where the requested information –
contained in a system of records and retrieved by the requester’s name – is
“about” that requester within the meaning of subsection (a)(4)’s definition of
“record,” all such information is subject to the subsection (d)(1) access provision.
Voelker v. IRS, 646 F.2d at 334. In construing subsection (d)(1), the Eighth
Circuit noted that there is “no justification for requiring that information in a
requesting individual’s record meet some separate ‘pertaining to’ standard
before disclosure is authorized [and i]n any event, it defies logic to say that
information properly contained in a person’s record does not pertain to that
person, even if it may also pertain to another individual.” Id. Relying on the
importance of the access provision to the enforcement of other provisions of the
Privacy Act, and the lack of any provision in the exemption portion of the statute
to protect a third party’s privacy, the Eighth Circuit rejected the government’s
argument that subsection (b) prohibited disclosure to the requester of the
information about a third party. Id. at 334-35. A careful reading of Voelker
reveals that the Eighth Circuit appeared to equate the term “record” with “file”
for subsection (d)(1) access purposes. Cf. Wren v. Harris, 675 F.2d 1144, 1146-47
(10th Cir. 1982) (per curiam) (concluding that district court improperly relied on
FOIA Exemption 6 to withhold certain third-party information without
considering whether under Privacy Act request was for access “to his (own)
record or to any information pertaining to him,” or for “records” contained in a
“system of records,” and whether they were exempt from disclosure under
Privacy Act exemptions); Henke v. Commerce, No. 94-0189, 1996 WL 692020, at
*4 (D.D.C. Aug. 19, 1994) (rejecting government’s argument that information
contained in one individual’s record is exempt from disclosure requirements of
Privacy Act simply because same information is also contained in another
individual’s records), aff’d on other grounds, 83 F.3d 1445 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Ray
v. DOJ, 558 F. Supp. 226, 228 (D.D.C. 1982) (ruling that requester was entitled to
access, under subsection (c)(3), to addresses of private persons who had
requested information about him because no Privacy Act exemption justified
withholding such information, notwithstanding that agency’s “concern about
possible harassment [sic] of these individuals may be legitimate”), aff’d, 720 F.2d

216 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (unpublished table decision).
Other courts, however, have found that certain information, although contained
in a file or document retrieved by an individual’s name, did not qualify as a
Privacy Act record because it was not “about” that individual. For example,
Voelker’s rationale was rejected by DePlanche v. Califano, 549 F. Supp. 685, 69398 (W.D. Mich. 1982), a case involving a father’s request for access to a social
security benefits file indexed and retrieved by his social security number that
contained the address of his two minor children. In denying the father access to
the children’s address, the court reasoned that such third-party information,
although contained in the father’s file, was not “about” the father, and therefore
by definition was not his “record” within the meaning of subsection (a)(4), nor
was it information “pertaining” to him within the meaning of the subsection
(d)(1) access provision. Id. at 694-96. In distinguishing Voelker, the court relied
upon an array of facts suggesting that the father might harass or harm his
children if their location were to be disclosed. Id. at 693, 696-98; see also Murray
v. BOP, 741 F. Supp. 2d 156, 161 (D.D.C. 2010) (concluding that, although names
of individuals who visited plaintiff in prison and dates and times of their visits
“certainly pertain[] to him in a generic sense,” and “include[] his name and
identifying number . . ., the balance of the information requested pertains to the
third party visitors personally; the information is not ‘about’ the plaintiff and
therefore is not a ‘record’”); Nolan v. DOJ, No. 89-A-2035, 1991 WL 36547, at *10
(D. Colo. Mar. 18, 1991) (holding names of FBI agents and other personnel were
not requester’s “record” and therefore “outside the scope of the [Privacy Act]”),

telephone extensions of FBI agents and personnel were not “about” plaintiff and
thus were properly withheld); Springmann v. State, No. 93-1238, slip op. at 8 &
n.1 (D.D.C. Apr. 21, 1997) (citing Nolan and holding that name of foreign official
who provided information to State Department and names of foreign service
officers (other than plaintiff) who were denied tenure were “not accessible to
plaintiff under the Privacy Act because the identities of these individuals d[id]
not constitute information ‘about’ plaintiff, and therefore [we]re not ‘records’
with respect to plaintiff under the Privacy Act”); Hunsberger v. CIA, No. 922186, slip op. at 3-4 (D.D.C. Apr. 5, 1995) (citing Nolan and holding that names of
employees of private insurance company used by Director of Central Intelligence
and Director’s unique professional liability insurance certificate number

4:90-CV- 156, slip op. at 9-11 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 14, 1992) (citing DePlanche, supra,
with approval and arriving at same result, but conducting analysis solely under
FOIA Exemption 6), aff’d, 972 F.2d 346 (6th Cir. 1992) (unpublished table
decision).
The District Court for the District of Columbia was confronted with a more
complex version of this issue of third-party information when the subject of a
letter requested access to it and the agencies withheld it to protect the author’s
privacy interests. Topuridze v. USIA, 772 F. Supp. 662 (D.D.C. 1991),
reconsidering Topuridze v. FBI, No. 86-3120, 1989 WL 11709 (D.D.C. Feb. 6,
1989). In Topuridze, the issue of access to third-party information in a
requester’s file was further complicated by the fact that the information was
“retrievable” by both the requester’s identifier and the third party’s identifier,
i.e., “dual retrieval.” Topuridze v. FBI, No. 86-3120, 1989 WL 11709, at *1 (D.D.C.
Feb. 6, 1989). In apparent contradiction to the subsection (d)(1) access provision,
subsection (b) prohibits the nonconsensual disclosure of an individual’s record
contained in a system of records retrieved by his name or personal identifier to
any third party. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b). Because the letter was both the
requester’s and the third party’s Privacy Act record, the government argued that
subsection (b), though technically not an “exemption,” nevertheless restricts
first-party access under subsection (d)(1) where the record is about both the
requester and the third-party author, and is located in a system of records that is
“retrievable” by both their names. See Topuridze v. FBI, No. 86-3120, 1989 WL
11709, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 6, 1989); Topuridze v. USIA, 772 F. Supp. at 665-66.
Although the court had previously ruled that the document was not about the
author, see Topuridze v. FBI, No. 86-3120, 1989 WL 11709, at *2-3 (D.D.C. Feb. 6,
1989), on reconsideration it ruled that it need not reach that issue, finding that
“[b]ecause the document is without dispute about the [requester], it must be
released to him in any event.” 772 F. Supp. at 665. On reconsideration, the court
embraced Voelker and rejected the government’s argument that subsection (b)
created a “dual record exemption” to Privacy Act access. Id. at 665-66.
However, the D.C. Circuit reached a result different from those reached in
Voelker and Topuridze, although the court did not mention either of those cases.
Sussman, 494 F.3d 1106. The Sussman court concluded that information
retrieved about the requestor and another third party could not be disclosed to
the requestor unless the third party had consented. The U.S. Marshals Service
had processed Sussman’s subsection (d)(1) request “by searching for records
indexed to his name” and found only one document. Sussman v. Marshals Serv.,
No. Civ. A. 03-610, 2005 WL 3213912, at *1 (D.D.C. Oct. 13, 2005). Sussman
argued that the Marshals Service performed an inadequate search and identified
a “Wanted Poster” that the Marshals Service had issued for Keith Maydak,
[150]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

which listed “Michael Sussman” as an alias for “Keith Maydak.” 494 F.3d 1109.
The Marshals Service conducted a second search, “now taking into account
Sussman’s connections to Maydak.” Id. at 1110. The second search yielded more
than 800 pages of documents “relating to Sussman.” Id. The district court stated
that “the [Marshals Service] searched Keith Maydak’s files for records related or
pertaining to [Sussman] or that mentioned [Sussman] by name.” 2005 WL
3213912, at *2. The Marshals Service disclosed only some of these records to
Sussman. 494 F.3d at 1110. Sussman brought a subsection (d)(1) claim against
the Marshals Service. Id. The D.C. Circuit “interpret[ed] 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1) to
give parties access only to their own records, not to all information pertaining to
them that happens to be contained in a system of records.” Id. at 1121. The
court explained that “[f]or an assemblage of data to qualify as one of Sussman’s
records, it must not only contain his name or other identifying particulars but
also be ‘about’ him. . . . That is, it must actually describe him in some way.” Id.;
see also Aguirre v. SEC, 671 F. Supp. 2d 113, 122 (D.D.C. 2009) (declining to
dismiss claim seeking access to record that “clearly contains plaintiff’s name and
describes him, his history at the SEC and details related to his termination”
because record “sufficiently describes plaintiff to satisfy the standard established
by Sussman”). Thus, the court held, “the Marshals Service must disclose to
Sussman those materials – and only those materials – contained in records about
him, the release of which would not violate 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b).” Id. In a footnote,
the court explained that “[i]f certain materials pertain to both Sussman and other
individuals, from whom the Marshals Service has received no written consent
permitting disclosure, the Privacy Act would both require (5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1))
and forbid (id. § 552a(b)) their disclosure.” Id. at n.9. In such a situation,
subsection (d)(1) must give way because “the consent requirement in § 552a(b) is
one of the most important, if not the most important, provisions in the Privacy
Act.” Id.; see also Mobley v. CIA, 924 F. Supp. 2d 24, 57 (D.D.C. 2013) (following
Sussman and denying plaintiff access to information about plaintiff but also
about third-party individuals who did not provide written consent to have their
information disclosed); Anderson v. Treasury, No. 76-1404, slip op. at 13 (D.D.C.
July 19, 1977) (presaging Sussman by finding name of third- party complainant
in requester’s file to be “about” complainant and, therefore, denying requester
access to complainant’s name).
The D.C. Circuit’s opinion in Sussman seriously calls into question the validity of
Topuridze, insofar as Topuridze could be read to require an agency to disclose to
a requester “those materials -- contained in records about him” even if the
release of those materials would violate the subsection (b) rights of the nonrequesting party. See Sussman, 494 F.3d at 1121. While Sussman controls in the
D.C. Circuit, which has universal venue for Privacy Act matters, the holding in
Voelker remains undisturbed in the Eighth Circuit.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Individuals are not required to provide a reason for requesting access to records, but
agencies must verify individuals’ identities before releasing requested records.
A requester need not state his reason for seeking access to records under the
Privacy Act, but an agency should verify the identity of the requester in order to
avoid violating subsection (b). See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,95758, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75; see also 5 U.S.C. § 552a(i)(1)
(criminal penalties for disclosure of information to parties not entitled to it); 5
U.S.C. § 552a(i)(3) (criminal penalties for obtaining records about individual
under false pretenses); cf., e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 16.41(d) (2020) (DOJ regulation
requiring requestor to verify identity).
Agencies are not obligated to turn over documents that are created after the date of an
access request, but, in the FOIA context, courts have held that agencies must act
reasonably and notify the requestor when setting a cut-off date.
Although subsection (d)(1) “carries no prospective obligation to turn over new
documents that come into existence after the date of the request,” Crichton v.
Cmty. Servs. Admin., 567 F. Supp. 322, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), the Courts have
acknowledged that agencies may set a cut-off date for FOIA searches, but have
imposed limitations such as reasonableness and notice to the requestor. For
example, the D.C. Circuit has held that under the FOIA, a date-of-request cut-off
policy regardless of circumstances – as opposed to a date-of-search cut-off policy
– was unreasonable under the facts of that case. Pub. Citizen v. State, 276 F.3d
634, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Leopold v. DOJ, 411 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1102 (C.D. Cal.
2019) (“the agency generally uses the date the search was run as the cut-off
date”); Prop. of the People, Inc. v. DOJ, 405 F. Supp. 3d 99, 120 (D.D.C. 2019)
(“[T]he FBI’s ‘unpublicized temporal limitation of its searches’ was improper.”
(quoting McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095, 1101 (D.C. Cir. 1983))); Vento v. IRS,
714 F. Supp. 2d 137, 144–45 (D.D.C. 2010) (concluding that a date of request
cutoff was appropriate and harmonizing Pub. Citizen v. State).

AGENCY REQUIREMENTS
The Privacy Act requires agencies maintain systems of records according to certain
standards. The Act includes 11 such requirements which are discussed in turn below.
A. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(1) - Maintain Only Relevant and Necessary Information
“Each agency that maintains a system of records shall –
(1) maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is
relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be
accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President.”
5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(1).
Comment:
Agencies can only keep records that are “relevant and necessary” for a purpose “required
to be accomplished” by law.
This subsection “authorizes the Government to keep records pertaining to an
individual only when they are ‘relevant and necessary’ to an end ‘required to be
accomplished’ by law. NASA v. Nelson, 562 U.S. 134, 142 (2011); Reuber v.

Directly from the Individual
“Each agency that maintains a system of records shall –

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

(2) collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject
individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an
individual’s rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(e)(2).
Comment:
In order to obtain relief under subsection (e)(2) of the Privacy Act, a plaintiff
must establish that: (1) the agency failed to elicit information directly from the
plaintiff to the greatest extent practicable; (2) the violation of the Act was
intentional or willful; and (3) this action had an adverse effect on the plaintiff.
Waters v. Thornburgh, 888 F.2d 870, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Waters involved a
Justice Department employee whose supervisor became aware of information
that raised suspicions concerning the employee’s unauthorized use of
administrative leave. 888 F.2d at 871-72. Without first approaching the
employee for clarification, the supervisor sought and received from a state board
of law examiners verification of the employee’s attendance at a bar examination.
Id. at 872. In finding a violation of subsection (e)(2) on these facts, the D.C.
Circuit ruled that “[i]n the context of an investigation that is seeking objective,
unalterable information, reasonable questions about a subject’s credibility cannot
relieve an agency from its responsibility to collect that information first from the
subject.” Id. at 873 (emphasis added); accord Dong v. Smithsonian Inst., 943 F.
Supp. 69, 72-73 (D.D.C. 1996) (“concern over Plaintiff’s possible reaction to an
unpleasant rumor” did not warrant Smithsonian Institution’s “fail[ure] to elicit
information regarding her alleged unauthorized courier trip directly from her”),
rev’d on grounds of statutory inapplicability, 125 F.3d 877 (D.C. Cir. 1997)
(ruling that “Smithsonian is not an agency for Privacy Act purposes”).
The OMB 1975 Guidelines suggest several factors to be evaluated in determining
whether it is impractical to contact the subject first. 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,961,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75; see also 120 Cong. Rec. 40,407,
reprinted in Source Book at 863, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_
sourcebook.
Courts generally have not required agencies to obtain information directly from the
subject individual where the individual could interfere with evidence or is accused of
misconduct.
The D.C. Circuit in Waters distinguished its earlier decision in Brune v. IRS, 861
F.2d 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1988), which had permitted an IRS supervisor to contact
taxpayers to check on an agent’s visits to them without first interviewing the
agent, based upon the “special nature of the investigation in that case – possible

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

false statements by an IRS agent” and the concomitant risk that the agent, if
contacted first, could coerce the taxpayers to falsify or secret evidence. Waters,
888 F.2d at 874; see also Velikonja v. Mueller, 362 F. Supp. 2d 1, 19-20 (D.D.C.
2004) (“seeking records from an electronic door log is very different from asking
[plaintiff’s] colleagues, rather than her, about her schedule” as “[t]he door log
provided the most objective source of information about her actual entry times to
the building, and unlike the proof of bar exam attendance in Waters, the records
could not be obtained from plaintiff”), aff’d in pertinent part & rev’d in part sub
nom. Velikonja v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d 122 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (per curiam).
Consistent with Brune, two other decisions have upheld the IRS’s practice of
contacting taxpayers prior to confronting agents who were under internal
investigations. See Alexander v. IRS, No. 86-0414, 1987 WL 13958, at *6-7 (D.D.C.
June 30, 1987); Merola v. Treasury, No. 83-3323, slip op. at 5-9 (D.D.C. Oct. 24,
1986).
In addition, the courts have often followed Brune rather than Waters where there
was an indication that the subject of the records previously harassed or
threatened other potential witnesses or where it would not have made a
difference had the subject been contacted first. For example, the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit relied on Brune and the OMB guidelines and
regulations to hold that subsection (e)(2) had not been violated by an
investigator looking into charges of misconduct by an Assistant U.S. Attorney
who had interviewed others before interviewing her. Hudson v. Reno, 130 F.3d
1193, 1205 (6th Cir. 1997). Given that the district court had found that the AUSA
“was suspected of making false statements and she was allegedly intimidating
and threatening people and otherwise dividing the U.S. Attorney’s office,” the
Sixth Circuit held that “[a]ll of these practical considerations demonstrate that
[the investigator] did not violate the Privacy Act when he interviewed others
before interviewing [her].” 130 F.3d at 1205.
Moreover, in a case involving a misconduct investigation into whether an agency
employee had been intoxicated on the job, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit went so far as to observe that “[s]o long as the agency inevitably will
need to interview both [the employee] and others, the Act takes no position on
the order in which they [a]re approached.” Hogan v. England, 159 F. App’x 534,
537 (4th Cir. 2005). See also Carton v. Reno, 310 F.3d 108, 112-13 (2d Cir. 2002)
(permitting “a preference to interview [plaintiff] last” when investigating
misconduct complaint against him because of plaintiff’s “authority as an INS
agent” and existing “specific allegations that [plaintiff] had already terrorized
and intimidated the complainants”); Cardamone v. Cohen, 241 F.3d 520, 527-28
(6th Cir. 2001) (finding it “impracticable to think that charges of employee

“subjective allegations of employee mistreatment”); Carlson v. GSA, No. 04-C7937, 2006 WL 3409150, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 21, 2006) (ruling that agency did not
violate subsection (e)(2) “by not interviewing [an agency employee] first” since
“[t]he issues under investigation [regarding the employee’s undisclosed arrest]
could not have been resolved by objective evidence within [the employee’s]
possession”; and concluding that “[t]he Act does not require the agency to
undertake a piecemeal investigation by obtaining objective evidence first and
then interviewing third party witnesses as to the more subjective claims”);

of an investigation into allegations made by coworkers that plaintiff helped

interviews therefore would not have altered the investigation’s impact on
plaintiff’s reputation”); Mumme v. Labor, 150 F. Supp. 2d 162, 173 (D. Me. 2001)

where plaintiff was not timely interviewed in investigation despite agency’s
claim plaintiff was in position to intimidate third parties or encourage collusion).
The Eighth and D.C. Circuits have suggested that an agency does not “collect”
information within the meaning of subsection (e)(2) when it already exists in its own
files.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has examined the issue of whether a
“collection” subject to the requirements of subsection (e)(2) occurs when an
agency reviews its own files to obtain information. Darst v. SSA, 172 F.3d 1065
(8th Cir. 1999). The Eighth Circuit held that because the “situation merely
involved a review of the agency’s file,” the agency “did not contact third party
sources to gather information,” and because “the indications of impropriety
were apparent from the face of the documents and from the sequence of events”
reflected in the file, there was “no need to interview Darst about the sequence of
events,” and thus no violation of subsection (e)(2). Id. at 1068. The Eighth
Circuit further stated that “[a]s the district court noted, the Privacy Act does not
require that the information be collected directly from the individual in all
circumstances,” and that “[h]ere the information in the [agency] file obviated the
need to interview Darst or third persons.” Id.; see also Brune v. IRS, 861 F.2d at
1287 (stating that “investigations of false statement charges, by their nature,
involve a suspect who has already given the government his version of the
facts”); Velikonja, 362 F. Supp. 2d at 20 (holding that agency was not required to
interview plaintiff before examining “electronic door logs” to compare them
with her sworn attendance sheets because objective proof – “electronic door
logs” – could not be obtained from plaintiff).
Several courts have held that agencies generally meet the subsection (e)(2) requirement
where they give individuals the opportunity to provide information.
In several cases, the courts have found that an agency satisfied its section (e)(2)
obligations by giving an individual an opportunity to provide information, even
if the individual did not actually provide it. See Olivares v. NASA, No. 95-2343,
1996 WL 690065, at *2-3 (4th Cir. Dec. 3, 1996) (finding that defendant had
contacted plaintiff directly before contacting universities to verify academic
credentials where plaintiff was given opportunity to provide information in his
employment application and personal interview), aff’g per curiam 882 F. Supp.
1545 (D. Md. 1995); Hubbard v. EPA, 809 F.2d 1, 6 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (defendant

1867106 (E.D.N.Y Jan. 29, 2018) (magistrate’s recommendation) (finding

rather than on recordkeeping requirements and, therefore, outside Court’s
purview) adopted, 2018 WL 1089736 (E.D.N.Y. Feb 26, 2018).
In a few cases, the courts have concluded that the subsection (e)(2) requirement was not
triggered.
Agencies are not obligated to obtain information from the subject individual
directly if those records are exempt from section (e)(2), the individual has not
made a sufficiently detailed allegation, or the agency was authorized to obtain
the information from another source. See Gadson v. John Doe, No. 3:15-CV00040-KRG, 2016 WL 3469383 (W.D. Pa. May 24, 2016) (magistrate’s

5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3) - Inform Individuals when Asking to Collect Information
“Each agency that maintains a system of records shall –
...
(3) inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, on the form
which it uses to collect the information or on a separate form that can be retained
by the individual – (A) the authority (whether granted by statute, or by executive
order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and
whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; (B) the
principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;
(C) the routine uses which may be made of the information, as published
pursuant to paragraph (4)(D) of this subsection; and (D) the effects on him, if
any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(e)(3).
Comment:
OMB guidelines state that the subsection (e)(3) notice requirement is intended to give
individuals sufficient information to enable them to decide whether to supply
information.
The OMB 1975 Guidelines explain that “[i]mplicit in this subsection is the notion
of informed consent since an individual should be provided with sufficient
information about the request for information to make an informed decision on
whether or not to respond.” 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,961, https://www.justice.gov/
paoverview_omb-75. The OMB 1975 Guidelines also note that subsection (e)(3)
is applicable to both written and oral (i.e., interview) solicitations of personal
information. Id.
Most courts have afforded agencies broad latitude in determining the content of their
subsection (e)(3) notices.
Generally, an agency does not need to explain “all of [its] rules and regulations”
[162]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

on “one small form” to meet the substantive requirements of subsection (e)(3).
Glasgold v. Sec’y of HHS, 558 F. Supp. 129, 150 (E.D.N.Y. 1982); see also Field v.
Brown, 610 F.2d 981, 987 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (holding that the agency’s form
“contained all the elements required by 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3)”).
In evaluating the requirements of subsection (e)(3)(A), “[n]othing in the Privacy
Act requires agencies to employ the exact language of the statute to give effective
notice.” United States v. Wilber, 696 F.2d 79, 80 (8th Cir. 1982) (per curiam)
(finding that an IRS notice was in compliance with subsection (e)(3)(A) even
though it did not use the word “mandatory”); see also Bartoli v. Richmond, No.
00-1043, 2000 WL 687155, at *3 (7th Cir. May 23, 2000) (finding that the IRS
sufficiently gave notice pursuant to subsection (e)(3)(A) by citing section 6001 of
the Internal Revenue Code as authority for its field examination); United States
v. Bressler, 772 F.2d 287, 292-93 (7th Cir. 1985) (following Wilber); cf. Thompson
v. State, 400 F. Supp. 2d 1, 17 (D.D.C. 2005) (finding that “[t]he very uses of the
information to which plaintiff specifically objects (i.e., giving it to [other offices
within the agency] and placing it in her security file) . . . can be reasonably
inferred from the warning given,” which stated that the information was being
collected for an “administrative inquiry regarding misconduct or improper
performance”; further stating that plaintiff could infer from this warning that “if
she provided information revealing misconduct by her, the agency might use it
to make a determination adverse to her”).
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has gone so far as to rule in favor of an
agency even though the agency “clearly did not follow the Act’s requirements
because the [form] did not indicate whether filling out the form was voluntary or
mandatory or, alternatively, because [plaintiff’s] supervisors ordered him to fill
out the form even though filling it out was voluntary.” Sweeney v. Chertoff, 178
F. App’x 354, 357 (5th Cir. 2006). The court held that the appellant’s injury was
“sufficiently attenuated from any violation of the Act’s requirements to preclude
a finding of causation.” Id. The court reasoned that the Privacy Act did not
provide the remedy for the plaintiff’s damages – which arose from his
punishment for insubordination based on his refusal to fill out the form –
because “the Privacy Act is not the proper channel by which to challenge internal
agency disciplinary actions with which one disagrees.” Id. at 358 & n.3.
One court has held that a notice that informed witnesses of an investigation into
allegations of misconduct but did not warn of the investigation subject’s possible
termination as an outcome, met the requirements of subsection (e)(3)(B) because
the “text of the statute clearly requires” that the witnesses be notified of the
“purpose” of the interview “not [its] possible results.” Cardamone v. Cohen, No.
3:97CV540H, slip op. at 4-5 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 30, 1999), aff’d, 241 F.3d 520, 529-30

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

(6th Cir. 2001); cf. Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F.2d 788, 798 n.6 (9th Cir. 1980)
(noting that when plaintiff provided information to agency “albeit originally in
connection with a check for a top secret security clearance,” he “must have
known that information which disclosed grounds for being discharged could be
used in discharge proceedings”), overruled on other grounds by Witt v. Depart.
of Air Force, 527 F.3d 806, 820-821 (9th Cir. 2008); Thompson, 400 F. Supp. 2d at
16 (ruling that agency need not “tell an individual that she is the subject of an
investigation” in order to provide her with “informed consent” where agency
notified employee that purpose of collection was to assess her “suitability for
continued employment”).
In addition, several courts have found in criminal cases that subsection (e)(3)(D)
does not require an agency to provide notice of the specific criminal penalty that
may be imposed for failure to provide information. See, e.g., United States v.
Bishop, 946 F.2d 896, at *4 (6th Cir. Oct. 23, 1991) (unpublished table decision)
(per curiam); Bressler, 772 F.2d at 292-93; United States v. Bell, 734 F.2d 1315,
1318 (8th Cir. 1984) (per curiam); Wilber, 696 F.2d 79, at 80; United States v.
Annunziato, 643 F.2d 676, 678 (9th Cir. 1981); United States v. Rickman, 638 F.2d
182, 183 (10th Cir. 1980); United States v. Gillotti, 822 F. Supp. 984, 988 (W.D.N.Y.
1993).
Some courts have determined that an agency’s failure to provide notice of the routine
uses which may be made of the information consistent with the subsection (e)(3) notice
requirement precluded later reliance on that routine use to disclose the information in
compliance with the Privacy Act’s disclosure provisions.
In Covert v. Harrington, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit held that an agency component’s failure to provide actual notice of a
routine use under subsection (e)(3)(C), at the time at which information was
submitted, precluded a separate component of the agency, the Inspector General,
from later invoking that routine use as a basis for disclosing such information.
876 F.2d 751, 755-56 (9th Cir. 1989); see also Puerta v. HHS, No. 99-55497, 2000
WL 863974, at *1-2 (9th Cir. June 28, 2000) (following Covert, but finding that

788-790 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (holding that disclosure of social security records to

agency must comply with subsection (e)(3)(C) “to substantiate an exception for
‘routine use’”). But see OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,961-62,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (“It was not the intent of
[subsection (e)(3)] to create a right the nonobservance of which would preclude
the use of the information or void an action taken on the basis of that
information.”).
The courts have split on whether the subsection (e)(3) notice requirement applies when
the agency solicits information from a third party.
Some authorities have concluded that subsection (e)(3) is inapplicable when an
agency solicits information about an individual from a third party. See Gardner
v. United States, No. 96-1467, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2195, at *19 (D.D.C. Jan. 29,
1999) (noting that although it is correct that the Privacy Act mandates actual
notice of routine uses, “information in the instant case was not gathered from
Plaintiff, but from third parties”), summary affirmance granted on other
grounds, No. 99-5089, 1999 WL 728359 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 4, 1999) (per curiam);
McTaggart v. United States, 570 F. Supp. 547, 550 (E.D. Mich. 1983) (finding
individual lacks standing to complain of insufficient Privacy Act notice to third
party); Truxal v. Casey, 2 Gov’t Disclosure Serv. (P-H) ¶ 81,391, at 82,043 (S.D.
Ohio Apr. 3, 1981); cf. United States v. The Inst. for Coll. Access & Success, 956 F.
Supp. 2d 190, 198 (D.D.C. 2013) (finding that “Privacy Act Notification is vague
as to what the [agency] may demand from independent third parties unrelated
to the federal government”), rev’d on other grounds, 27 F. Supp. 3d 106 (D.D.C.
2014). The OMB 1975 Guidelines support this view, but suggest that “agencies
should, where feasible, inform third-party sources of the purposes for which
information which they are asked to provide will be used.” 40 Fed. Reg. at
28,961, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75.
On the other hand, the practice of not providing notice to third parties was
condemned by the Privacy Protection Study Commission. See Privacy
Commission Report at 514, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_ppsc. In the
same vein, several courts have followed the Commission’s views on this issue.
See Usher v. Sec’y of HHS, 721 F.2d 854, 856 (1st Cir. 1983) (costs awarded to
plaintiff due to agency “intransigence” in refusing to provide information

System of records notices (SORNs) are available on agency websites and are compiled by

Privacy Act system notices are published in the Federal Register, and the

compilation of all such system notices. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(f). Those Privacy Act
Compilation Issuances contain descriptions of federal agency systems of records
maintained on individuals and procedures that federal agencies follow to assist
individuals who request information about their records. Each issuance contains
individual Privacy Act system descriptions and their governing regulations.
Privacy Act Compilation Issuances beginning in 1995 are available on the
Government Printing Office’s (GPO) Federal Digital System (FDsys) website.
See https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/PAI/. Bulk XML download of
Privacy Act Issuances can be accessed at: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/
privacy-act-issuances-bulk-xml.
In order to provide more current and convenient access to system notices, OMB
requires each agency to “list and provide links to complete, up-to-date versions
of all agency SORNs,” including citations and links to all Federal Register notices
that comprise the SORN for each system of records. OMB Circular A-108, at 2930, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-a-108. For an example, see the
Department of Justice’s publication of its systems of records. See DOJ Privacy
Act Systems of Records, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/doj-systems-records.
The Tenth Circuit concluded that an agency was not required to publish a new SORN
where the new system was composed of abstracts of two other systems of records that had
published SORNs.
The only case to discuss the subsection (e)(4) SORN requirements in any depth is
Pippinger v. Rubin, 129 F.3d 519 (10th Cir. 1997). In that case, the Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit addressed whether the Internal Revenue Service
had complied with several of the requirements of subsection (e)(4) with regard to
a computer database known as the “Automated Labor Employee Relations
Tracking System [(ALERTS)].” Id. at 524-28. The database was used by the IRS
to record all disciplinary action proposed or taken against any IRS employee and
contained a limited subset of information from two existing Privacy Act systems
[167]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

that the IRS had properly noticed in the Federal Register. See id. at 524-25. Of
particular note is that the Tenth Circuit found that ALERTS, being an
“abstraction of certain individual records” from other systems of records, did not
constitute a new system of records requiring Federal Register publication,
because it could be accessed only by the same users and only for the same
purposes as those published in the Federal Register for the original systems of
records. Id. at 526-27. Cf. Corr v. Bureau of the Pub. Debt, 987 F. Supp. 2d 711,
718 (S.D. W.Va. 2013) (finding that “SORN applies only to employee grievances
filed under the Administrative Grievance Procedure” and plaintiff cannot obtain
access to records and claim “benefit of this system after failing to comply with
the requirements that would have brought his complaints within the scope of the
SORN”).

5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(5) - Maintain Accurate, Relevant, Timely, and Complete
Records
“Each agency that maintains a system of records shall –
...
(5) maintain all records which are used by the agency in making any
determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness,
and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual
in the determination.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(5).
Comment:
The subsection (e)(5) requirement establishes a standard against which the accuracy of a
record is measured in other Privacy Act provisions, including agency dissemination and
amendment requirements, and certain causes of action.
This provision (along with subsections (e)(1) and (e)(7)) sets forth the standard to
which records must conform in the context of an amendment lawsuit, as well as
in the context of a lawsuit brought under subsection (g)(1)(C) for damages. See 5
U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A); 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C). The “accuracy, relevance,
timeliness, and completeness” standard in subsection (e)(5) is also used in
subsections (e)(6), relating to dissemination of information and (g)(1)(C).
Subsection (e)(6) states that, prior to disseminating any record about an
individual to any person other than an agency, the agency must reasonably
ensure the records in question are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for
agency purposes. The one exception to this provision is records that are released
in accordance with and as required under the Freedom of Information Act.
Specifically, subsection (g)(1)(C) provides for civil remedies for a record that
does not meet the “accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness” standard.
[168]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

As the D.C. Circuit has held, “whether the nature of the relief sought is
injunctive or monetary, the standard against which the accuracy of the record is
measured remains constant [and] that standard is found in 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(5)
and reiterated in 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C).” Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d 694,
697 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc).
In theory, a violation of this provision (or any other part of the Act) could also
give rise to a damages action under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(D). Cf. Perry v. FBI, 759
F.2d 1271, 1275 (7th Cir. 1985), rev’d en banc on other grounds, 781 F.2d 1294
(7th Cir. 1986). However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit has held that “a plaintiff seeking damages for noncompliance with the
standard set out in subsection (e)(5) must sue under subsection (g)(1)(C) and not
subsection (g)(1)(D).” Deters v. Parole Comm’n, 85 F.3d 655, 660-61 & n.5 (D.C.
Cir. 1996) (noting that although court had suggested in Dickson v. OPM, 828
F.2d 32, 39 (D.C. Cir. 1987), that subsection (g)(1)(D) could cover violation of
subsection (e)(5), “the holding in that case is limited to the scope of subsection
(g)(1)(C)”).
Agencies that do not maintain records consistent with the standards set by subsection
(e)(5) are not subject to damages claims if the records are maintained in a system of
records that is properly exempted from this requirement.
Records systems that an agency has exempted from the Privacy Act in a Federal
Register notice are not subject to civil damages actions for inaccurate or
substandard recordkeeping of those records. See e.g., Dick v. Holder, 67 F. Supp.
3d 167, 184 (D.D.C. 2014) (concluding that records were exempt from the
maintenance requirement of § 552a(e)(5) where Attorney General had
“established regulations pursuant to this subsection that exempt materials in the
FBI’s Central Records System from various provisions of the Privacy Act”);
Barnett v. United States, 195 F. Supp. 3d 4, 8 (D.D.C. 2016) (holding that because
BOP exempted certain inmate records from Privacy Act, it “follows that there
remains no remedy under the Privacy Act for harm resulting from inaccuracies
in the inmate records”); Ali v. ICE, No. 1:16-CV-037-BL, 2017 WL 4325785, at *6
(N.D. Tx. Aug. 29, 2017), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:16-CV-037C, 2017 WL 4296756 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 26, 2017). An agency’s exemption from
certain Privacy Act provisions does not foreclose a plaintiff’s opportunity to
allege violations of the Constitution, however. Cf. Abdelfattah v. U.S. Dept. of
Homeland Sec., 787 F.3d 524, 534-538 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“We have repeatedly
recognized a plaintiff may request expungement of agency records for both
violations of the Privacy Act and the Constitution.”).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The Federal Bureau of Prisons, a defendant in many amendment suits, exempted a
number of its systems of records from the subsection (e)(5) requirement in 2002.
Among the most frequently litigated subsection (e)(5)/(g)(1)(C) claims are those
brought by federal inmates against the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The
discussion of subsection (e)(5), below, includes citations to numerous cases
involving such claims. Note, however, that it was not until 2002 that the BOP
exempted many of its systems of records in a published SORN – among them,
notably, the Inmate Central Records System – from subsection (e)(5) pursuant to
subsection (j)(2). See 28 C.F.R. § 16.97(j) (codifying 67 Fed. Reg. 51,754 (Aug. 9,
2002)). This came about as a result of Sellers v. BOP, 959 F.2d 307, 309-312 (D.C.
Cir. 1992), in which the D.C. Circuit noted that “regulations governing the BOP .
. . do not exempt [the agency’s] records from section (e)(5) of the Act” and,
accordingly, remanded the case for a determination of “whether the [agency]
met the requirements of sections (e)(5) and (g)(1)(C)” with regard to the items of
information at issue.
While the subsection (e)(5) analyses contained in cases decided prior to the
promulgation of that exemption regulation remain useful resources in
interpreting subsection (e)(5), that inmates’ subsection (e)(5)/(g)(1)(C) claims
arising subsequent to August 9, 2002, should not succeed. See, e.g., Blackshear v.
Lockett, 411 F. App’x 906, 907-08 (7th Cir. 2011) (“[A]fter Sellers the [BOP]
availed itself of a Privacy Act exemption that frees it from an obligation to keep
accurate inmate files. . . . Accordingly, the damages remedy available to the
plaintiff in Sellers is no longer applicable.”); Lane v. BOP, No. 09-5228, 2010 WL
288816, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 7, 2010) (“Sellers v. Bureau of Prisons . . . does not

Courts have disagreed, however, on whether to permit claims to go forward that
arose before August 9, 2002, but were filed after that date. Compare Patel v.
United States, No. 08-1168, 2009 WL 1377530, at *1-2 (W.D. Okla. May 14, 2009)
(declining to dismiss claim on ground that record was exempt from subsection
(e)(5) because “the exemption . . . post-dates the allegedly false record”), aff’d,
399 F. App’x 355, 360 (10th Cir. 2010), with Truesdale v. DOJ, 731 F. Supp. 2d 3, 9
(D.D.C. 2010) (rejecting argument that “[b]ecause [plaintiff] had been allowed to
contest the accuracy of sentencing-related information before 28 C.F.R. § 16.97(j)

claims”; “Plaintiff cites no authority for the proposition that he need not be
subjected to a duly promulgated and published administrative regulation simply
because he demands amendment of records in existence before the effective date
of that regulation.”). See also Skinner v. BOP, 584 F.3d 1093, 1097 (D.C. Cir.
2009) (declining to decide whether “it would be impermissibly retroactive to
apply [the exemption] to [prisoner’s] lawsuit” where claim arose before date of
exemption but was filed after that date). This issue is discussed further under
“Ten Exemptions, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2) - Two General Exemptions for Central
Intelligence Agency and Criminal Law Enforcement,” below.
Agencies must take “reasonable” steps to meet the “accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and
completeness” standard, including but not limited to, correcting erroneous facts.
An agency “need not keep perfect records, but must act reasonably” to assure
accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness. See Colley v. James, 254

and provides a remedy to a claimant who demonstrates that facts underlying
judgments contained in his records have been discredited.” DeBold, 735 F.2d at
1040-41.
In addition, one court has held that where records contain disputed hearsay and
reports from informants and unnamed parties, “the records are maintained with
adequate fairness if they accurately reflect the nature of the evidence,” i.e.,
indicate that the information is a hearsay report from an unnamed informant.
Graham v. Hawk, 857 F. Supp. 38, 40 (W.D. Tenn. 1994), aff’d, 59 F.3d 170 (6th
Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision); cf. Hass v. Air Force, 848 F. Supp. 926,
931 (D. Kan. 1994) (acknowledging possibility that agency relied upon incorrect
information in making determination about plaintiff, finding still no Privacy Act
violation because no evidence was suggested that information was recorded
inaccurately).

Where agency records document judgements or evaluations based on a number of factors
or a diverse set of facts, courts generally are reluctant to question the accuracy, relevance,
timeliness, or completeness of those records.
As a general rule, courts are reluctant to disturb judgmental matters in an
individual’s record when such judgments are based on a number of factors or
when the factual predicates for a judgment or evaluation are diverse. As the
D.C. Circuit has ruled, where a subjective evaluation is “based on a multitude of
factors” and “there are various ways of characterizing some of the underlying
[factual] events,” it is proper to retain and rely on the record. White v. OPM, 787
F.2d 660, 662 (D.C. Cir. 1986); see also Mueller v. Winter, 485 F.3d 1191, 1197
(D.C. Cir. 2007) (holding amendment claim to be “doom[ed]” where “subjective
evaluation [was] based on a multitude of factors” and where “there [were]
various ways of characterizing some of the underlying events”); Westcott, 39 F.
Supp. 3d at 32 (“Even if the Court were to conclude that the plaintiff had
established that the objectively verifiable facts contained in the Reprimand were
false, several of the considerations cited by [the general] as factors influencing
his decision” ‒ such as the general’s perception of plaintiff’s attitude toward his
duties ‒ “are simply unassailable.”); Bernson v. ICC, 625 F. Supp. 10, 13 (D. Mass.
1984) (finding court cannot order amendment of opinions “to reflect the
plaintiffs’ version of the facts”); cf. Phillips v. Widnall, No. 96-2099, 1997 WL
176394, at *2-3 (10th Cir. Apr. 14, 1997) (holding that appellant was not entitled
to court-ordered amendment, nor award of damages, concerning record in her
medical files that contained “physician’s notation to the effect that [appellant]
was probably dependent upon a prescription medication,” as such notation
“reflected the physician’s medical conclusion, which he based upon a number of

objective factors and [appellant’s] own complaints of neck and low back pain,”
and “Privacy Act does not permit a court to alter documents that accurately
reflect an agency decision, no matter how contestable the conclusion may be”).
Courts have consistently determined that pure opinions and judgments do not require
amendment to satisfy the subsection (e)(5) requirement.
Many courts have held that pure opinions and judgments are not subject to
amendment. See, e.g., Barnett v. U.S., No. 15-1614 (BAH), 2016 WL 3350989

Act.”); Davidson v. Daniels, No. 07-960, 2007 WL 3232608, at *2 (D. Or. Oct. 28,
2007) (“Respondent has no authority to alter court judgments. The correction of

(stating that rating “is a highly subjective process which requires the opinions
and judgments of military professionals” and denying plaintiff’s request, which
was “in essence” that the court “determine de novo ‘a fair and accurate’ rating as
to the ‘quality’ of his service”).
The D.C. Circuit and a few district courts have found that agencies satisfy the subsection
(e)(5) requirement by maintaining verifiable information; in the atypical case where
information conflicts or the truth is not readily attainable, courts have assessed whether
agencies maintained records in a fair and reasonable manner.
In determining what steps an agency must take in order to satisfy the accuracy
standard of subsection (e)(5), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit has looked to whether the information at issue is capable of being
verified. In Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d 694, 697-701 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the D.C.
Circuit, sitting en banc, in a seven-to-four decision, held that the inclusion in a
job applicant’s record of both the applicant’s and agency interviewer’s
conflicting versions of an interview (in which only they were present) satisfies
subsection (e)(5)’s requirement of maintaining reasonably accurate records. In
rejecting the argument that the agency and reviewing court must themselves
make a credibility determination of which version of the interview to believe, the
D.C. Circuit ruled that subsections (e)(5) and (g)(1)(C) “establish as the recordkeeper’s polestar, ‘fairness’ to the individual about whom information is
gathered,” and that “the ‘fairness’ criterion does not demand a credibility
determination in the atypical circumstances of this case.” Id. at 699 (emphasis
added); see also Harris v USDA, 124 F. 3d 197 (6th Cir. 1997) (unpublished table
decision) (ruling that agency “reasonably excluded” information from the
plaintiff’s record where there was “substantial evidence that the [information]
was unreliable,” and in the absence of “verifiable information which
contradicted its investigators’ records,” the agency “reasonably kept and relied
on the information gathered by its investigators when it terminated plaintiff”);

resolve whether hearsay contained in report was true, so long as that
information was characterized as hearsay); Doe v. FBI, No. 91-1252, slip op. at 6-7
(D.N.J. Feb. 27, 1992) (following Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d at 699, and
holding that FBI fulfilled its obligations under Privacy Act by including
plaintiff’s objections to statements contained in FBI polygrapher’s memorandum
and by verifying to extent possible that polygraph was properly conducted).
Subsequently, the D.C. Circuit held that in a “typical” case, where the records at
issue are “not ambivalent” and the facts described therein are “susceptible of
proof,” the agency and reviewing court must determine accuracy as to each filed
item of information. Strang v. U.S. Arms Control & Disarmament Agency, 864
F.2d 859, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In order to “assure fairness” and render the record
“complete” under subsection (e)(5), an agency may even be required to include
contrary or qualifying information. See Strang v. U.S. Arms Control &
Disarmament Agency, 920 F.2d 30, 32 (D.C. Cir. 1990); Kassel v. VA, 709 F. Supp.
1194, 1204-05 (D.N.H. 1989).
Adhering to its holding in Strang, the D.C. Circuit later held:
As long as the information contained in an agency’s files is capable of
being verified, then, under sections (e)(5) and (g)(1)(C) of the Act, the
agency must take reasonable steps to maintain the accuracy of the
information to assure fairness to the individual. If the agency willfully
or intentionally fails to maintain its records in that way and, as a result,
it makes a determination adverse to an individual, then it will be liable
to that person for money damages. . . . [T]he agency did not satisfy the
requirements of the Privacy Act simply by noting in [the individual’s]
files that he disputed some of the information the files contained.
Sellers, 959 F.2d at 312. It is worth noting that Sellers was solely a subsection
(e)(5)/(g)(1)(C) case; the system of records at issue was exempt from access under
subsection (d). See also McCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2006)

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The D.C. Circuit has stated that subsection (e)(5) only requires an agency to address the
accuracy of a record before using it to make a determination about an individual if the
agency has no duty to amend the record pursuant to the Privacy Act’s amendment
provisions.
The D.C. Circuit has noted that where “an agency has no subsection (d) duty to
amend, upon request, it is not clear what residual duty subsection (e)(5) imposes
when an individual challenges the accuracy of a record.” Deters, 85 F.3d at 658
n.2. The court questioned whether subsection (e)(5) would still require an
agency to amend or expunge a record upon the individual’s request, or whether
the agency merely must “address the accuracy of the records at some point
before using it to make a determination of consequence to the individual.” Id.
Although stating that the Sellers opinion was “not entirely clear on this point,”
the D.C. Circuit reasoned that “the language of subsection (e)(5) . . . suggests the
latter course.” Id. (citing OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,964
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75). The court stated that subsection
(e)(5) suggests that an agency has “no duty to act on an [individual’s] challenge
and verify his record until the agency uses the record in making a determination
affecting his rights, benefits, entitlements or opportunities,” 85 F.3d at 660; see
also Bayless, 1996 WL 525325, at *6 n.19 (quoting Deters and determining that
agency “fulfilled its requisite duty by ‘addressing’ plaintiff’s allegations prior to
rendering a parole determination”); cf. Bassiouni v. FBI, No. 02-8918, 2003 WL
22227189, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 26, 2003) (holding that agency’s denial of request
to amend alleged inaccurate records about plaintiff was in and of itself a
“determination” under subsection (e)(5)), aff’d on other grounds, 436 F.3d 712
(7th Cir. 2006).
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an agency can comply with the
subsection (e)(5) requirement by simply including a complainant’s rebuttal statements
with the complainant’s records.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an agency can comply
with subsection (e)(5) by simply including a complainant’s rebuttal statement
with an allegedly inaccurate record. Fendler v. BOP, 846 F.2d 550, 554 (9th Cir.
1988) (subsections (e)(5) and (g)(1)(C) lawsuit); see also Graham, 857 F. Supp. at
40 (citing Fendler and holding that where individual disputes accuracy of
information that agency has characterized as hearsay, agency satisfies subsection
(e)(5) by permitting individual to place rebuttal in file); cf. Harris, 124 F.3d at 197
(holding that although exclusion of information from appellant’s record due to
unreliability of information was reasonable, it was “notabl[e]” that the appellant
had not contested the district court’s finding that the agency “did not prevent
him from adding to the file his disagreement with the [agency] investigators’
[179]

conclusions”). Fendler thus appears to conflict with both Doe v. United States
and Strang, as well as with the D.C. Circuit’s earlier decision in Vymetalik v. FBI,
785 F.2d 1090, 1098 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (noting that subsection (d)(2)
“guarantees an individual the right to demand that his or her records be
amended if inaccurate” and that mere inclusion of rebuttal statement was not
“intended to be [the] exclusive [remedy]”).
The Fifth Circuit and several other courts have held that to satisfy the subsection (e)(5)
“timeliness” requirement, agencies must incorporate notes into a record at the time the
records are used by the agency to make a determination about the individual.
In Chapman v. NASA, 682 F.2d 526, 528-30 (5th Cir. 1982), the Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit recognized a “timely incorporation” duty under subsection
(e)(5). It ruled that a supervisor’s personal notes “evanesced” into Privacy Act
records when they were used by the agency to effect an adverse disciplinary
action, and that such records must be placed into the employee’s file “at the time
of the next evaluation or report on the employee’s work status or performance.”
Id. at 529. In reversing the district court’s ruling that such notes were not records
within a system of records, the Fifth Circuit noted that such incorporation
ensures fairness by allowing employees a meaningful opportunity to make
refutatory notations, and avoids an “ambush” approach to maintaining records.
Id.; see also Thompson v. DOT U.S. Coast Guard, 547 F. Supp. 274, 283-84 (S.D.
Fla. 1982) (explaining Chapman). Chapman’s “timely incorporation” doctrine
has been followed in several other cases. See, e.g., MacDonald v. VA, No. 87544-CIV-T-15A, slip op. at 2-5 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 8, 1988) (stating that the counseling
memorandum used in preparation of proficiency report “became” part of VA
system of records); Lawrence v. Dole, No. 83-2876, slip op. at 5-6 (D.D.C. Dec. 12,
1985) (finding that notes not incorporated in timely manner cannot be used as
basis for adverse employment action); cf. Hudson v. Reno, 103 F.3d 1193, 1205-06
& n.9 (6th Cir. 1997) (distinguishing facts in Chapman and holding that
supervisor’s “notes about [p]laintiff’s misconduct which were kept in a locked
drawer and labeled the ‘First Assistant’s’ files do not fall within th[e system of
records] definition,” as they “were not used to make any determination with
respect to [p]laintiff”); Manuel v. VA, 857 F.2d 1112, 1117-19 (6th Cir. 1988)
(finding no duty to place records within system of records where records “are
not part of an official agency investigation into activities of the individual
requesting the records, and where the records requested do not have an adverse
effect on the individual”); Magee v. United States, 903 F. Supp. 1022, 1029-30
(W.D. La. 1995) (finding plaintiff’s file kept in a supervisor’s desk, separate from
other employee files, because of plaintiff’s concerns about access to it and with
plaintiff’s acquiescence, did “not fall within the proscriptions of maintaining a
‘secret file’ under the Act”), aff’d, 79 F.3d 1145 (5th Cir. 1996) (unpublished table

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

decision).
The subsection (e)(5) requirement does not require agencies to maintain only the most
recent information, but requires agencies to preserve records where the agency
“reasonably foresees” use of the record.
Turning to the “timeliness” requirement of subsection (e)(5)’s “accuracy,
relevance, timeliness, and completeness” standard, “timeliness” does not require
that agency records contain only information that is “hot off the presses.” White
v. OPM, 787 F.2d 660, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (rejecting argument that use of yearold evaluation violates Act, as it “would be an unwarranted intrusion on the
agency’s freedom to shape employment application procedures”); see also
Beckette v. USPS, No. 88-802, slip op. at 12-14 (E.D. Va. July 3, 1989) (stating that
“[a]ll of the record maintenance requirements of subsection 552a(e)(5), including
timeliness, concern fairness,” and finding that as to records regarding “restricted
sick leave,” “[w]iping the . . . slate clean after an employee has remained off the
listing for only six months is not required to assure fairness to the individual”;
also finding that maintenance of those records for six months after restricted sick
leave had been rescinded “did not violate the relevancy requirement of
subsection 552a(e)(5)”).
Agencies have a duty to preserve records where investigation and future
litigation is “reasonably foreseeable.” See Gerlich v. DOJ, 659 F. Supp. 2d 1
(D.D.C. 2009), aff’d in part, rev’d in part & remanded, on other grounds, 711 F.3d
161 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (holding that summary judgment was inappropriately
granted under subsections (e)(5) and (e)(7) claims and concluding “in light of the
destruction of appellants’ records, that a permissive spoliation inference was
warranted because the senior Department officials had a duty to preserve the
annotated applications and internet printouts given that Department
investigation and future litigation were reasonably foreseeable”). Agencies do
not need to keep records indefinitely, however. The Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit has held that subsection (e)(5) is “not violated by the destruction
of [a] record” that is destroyed “pursuant to [agency] records retention policy.”
Vaughn v. Danzig, 18 F. App’x 122, 124-25 (4th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (finding
that where Navy maintained record at issue in its files “at the time of the adverse
action,” the subsequent routine destruction of record was proper and, indeed,
plaintiff “cited no authority” to show that “the Privacy Act requires that records
be maintained in perpetuity”). Cf. Hunt v. VA, 888 F. Supp. 2d 48, 54 (D.D.C.
2012) (“Since plaintiff has not identified an agency record subject to testing for
accuracy, the Court must deny his motion for summary judgment because he has
not proffered any probative evidence of a Privacy Act violation.”), aff’d, 739 F.3d
706 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Cottrell v. Vilsack, 915 F. Supp. 2d 81, 91 (D.D.C. 2013)

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

(finding plaintiff had no subsection (e)(5) claim, stating that “[t]he Privacy Act
does not require that [agencies] maintain computerized records of unapproved
[agency program] applications”).
In addition to its accuracy and timeliness requirements, subsection (e)(5) requires
agencies to reasonably maintain only records that are “relevant” to an agency
determination about the individual.
Regarding the “relevance” prong of the “accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and
completeness” standard, the District Court of the District of Columbia found that
the inclusion of irrelevant documents in job candidates’ records was an
appropriate basis for a subsection (e)(5) claim. See Gerlich v. DOJ, 659 F. Supp.
2d at 16. The plaintiffs, who had applied to work for the Justice Department,
alleged that two members of the selection committee had taken the plaintiffs’
political and ideological associations into account in deselecting them for
interviews. Id. at 6. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that one official
“conducted Internet searches regarding candidates’ political and ideological
affiliations, printed out such information when it revealed liberal associations
and then attached the printouts and her own handwritten comments to the
candidates’ applications in support of her recommendations to deselect them.”
Id. The court noted that “[m]ost ‘adverse determination’ claims hinge on
inaccurate or incomplete records.” Id. at 15. Here, however, the plaintiffs
alleged that “irrelevant records (i.e., the records of their First Amendment
activities) led to an adverse determination against them (i.e., deselection by the
Screening Committee).” Id. The court rejected the Department’s argument that
the plaintiffs’ failure to allege any inaccuracy was grounds for dismissal of
plaintiffs’ (e)(5) claim: “By the plain language of (g)(1)(C), relevance stands on
equal footing with accuracy, timeliness and completeness as a basis for pursuing
money damages for an adverse determination.” Id. at 15-16. The court
concluded that “plaintiffs have met their pleading burden with respect to their
subsection (e)(5) claim” because they alleged “that they suffered an adverse
determination (deselection/non-hiring), that DOJ maintained irrelevant records
(regarding plaintiffs’ First Amendment activities) which undermined the fairness
of the hiring process, that DOJ’s reliance on those records (or the reliance of its
employees . . .) proximately caused the adverse determination, and that DOJ
(again, through its employees . . .) acted intentionally or willfully in maintaining
such records.” Id. at 16.

Stewart v. FBI, No. 97-1595, slip op. at 4 (D. Or. Mar. 12, 1999) (holding (e)(6) was
violated where agency failed to establish that it conducted reasonable efforts to
ensure accuracy of information “of a factual nature” that was “capable of being
verified”), withdrawn by stipulation as part of settlement, No. 97-1595, 2000 WL
739253 (D. Or. May 12, 2000); Gang v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, No. 76-1263, slip op.

review personnel file to determine relevance and timeliness of dated material
concerning political activities before disseminating it to Library of Congress).
Statements of opinion or judgment generally are not covered by the subsection (e)(6)
requirement.
The District Court for the District of Columbia has held that an agency was not
liable under subsection (e)(6) for damages for the dissemination of information
that plaintiff had claimed was inaccurate but that the court determined consisted
of statements of opinion and subjective evaluation that were not subject to
amendment. Webb v. Magaw, 880 F. Supp. 20, 25 (D.D.C. 1995); see also

“if the information gathered and contained within an individual’s background

false and cannot constitute inaccurate statements under the Privacy Act”); cf.

(concluding that “[b]ecause plaintiff has failed to show that there was an ‘error
in the records,’ . . . he cannot succeed under . . . (e)(6)”).
Some courts have utilized the “intentional and willful” standard for damages suits in
assessing agency compliance with the subsection (e)(6) requirement.
Other district courts considering claims under subsection (e)(6), have taken into
account the requirements of causation and intentional and willful wrongdoing in
Privacy Act damages actions, discussed below. Guccione v. Nat’l Indian Gaming
Comm’n, No. 98-CV-164, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15475, at *14-19 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 5,
1999). The court found that an administrative hearing concerning inconsistencies
in plaintiff’s employment application “smacked generally of reprimand even
though no talismanic phrases akin to reprimand were used,” and that therefore
“there was no ‘intentional’ or ‘willful’ misconduct in the [agency’s] use of the
term reprimand,” nor was there sufficient causation where the recipients of the
information also had reviewed the transcript of the administrative hearing and
could draw their own conclusions. Id. at *16-19; see also Conyers v. VA, No. 16CV-00013, 2018 WL 1867106, at *11 (E.D. N.Y. Jan. 29, 2018) (holding plaintiff
failed to state a claim under section 552a(e)(6) because plaintiff failed to “set
forth allegations that the Department personnel with whom he had contact dealt,
acted, or failed to act, in such a ‘patently egregious and unlawful [manner]’ so as
to have ‘known the conduct . . .[was] unlawful.’ Plaintiff, at best, alleges
‘administrative error’ for which the Privacy Act does not provide relief” (internal

The subsection (e)(6) requirement is not superseded by regulations governing the
National Practitioners’ Data Bank promulgated in accordance with the Health Care
Quality Improvement Act.
In addition, the District Court for the District of Columbia has concluded that
regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services
pursuant to the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, which concern collection
and dissemination of information contained in the National Practitioners’ Data
Bank, do not supersede the more stringent protections provided by subsection
(e)(6) of the Privacy Act. Doe v. Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 124, 129-32 (D.D.C.
2004).
G. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(7) - Record Describing the Exercise of Rights Guaranteed by
the First Amendment
Each agency that maintains a system of records shall -...
(7) maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights
guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by
the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and
within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(e)(7).
Comment:
Generally, agencies are prohibited from maintaining records about individuals’
First Amendment activities. The OMB 1975 Guidelines advise agencies
determining whether a particular activity constitutes exercise of a right
guaranteed by the First Amendment to “apply the broadest reasonable
interpretation.” 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,965, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview
_omb-75; see also 120 Cong. Rec. at 40,406, reprinted in Source Book at 860,

Records do not need to be in a system of records to be covered by the subsection (e)(7)
requirement, but must meet the definition of a “record” in accordance with the Privacy
Act.
The record at issue need not be within a system of records to violate subsection
(e)(7). See Maydak v. United States, 363 F.3d 512, 516-20 (D.C. Cir. 2004);

also the discussion under “Definitions, System of Records, Protections for

That said, the information at issue must meet the “record” definition under the
Privacy Act for subsection (e)(7) to be applicable. See e.g., Houghton v. State,
875 F. Supp. 2d 22, 31-32 (D.D.C. 2012) (finding that transcripts containing
reference to plaintiff’s work were not “about” plaintiff, and therefore, not record
under Privacy Act to implicate application of subsection (e)(7)); Iqbal v. FBI, No.
3:11-cv-369, 2012 WL 2366634, at *5 (M.D. Fla. June 21, 2012) (finding allegation
in complaint that stated “the agents [took] notes to aid the creation of official
reports” sufficient to “satisfy the requirement that the agency maintain[ed] a
record” in order to invoke application of subsection (e)(7)).
The record must implicate the individual’s First Amendment rights to be within the
scope of the subsection (e)(7) requirement.
The record at issue “must implicate an individual’s First Amendment rights.”
Boyd, 709 F.2d at 684; accord Banks v. Garrett, 901 F.2d 1084, 1089 (Fed. Cir.
1990); see also Elnashar v. DOJ, 446 F.3d 792, 794-95 (8th Cir. 2006) (explaining
that plaintiff “failed to identify how his First Amendment rights were
implicated” when FBI contacted him “to determine whether he had expertise

Thus, subsection (e)(7) is not triggered unless the record describes First
Amendment-protected activity. See, e.g., Maydak, 363 F.3d at 516 (finding “it
obvious that photographs of prisoners visiting with family, friends, and
associates depict the exercise of associational rights protected by the First
Amendment”); England v. Comm’r, 798 F.2d 350, 352-53 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding

Agencies are permitted to maintain a record describing how any individual exercises
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment if the agency is authorized by statute to
maintain that record.
Assuming that the challenged record itself describes activity protected by the
First Amendment, subsection (e)(7) is violated unless maintenance of the record
fits into one of the enumerated exceptions. Specifically, agencies may maintain
record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment “expressly authorized by statute.” See, e.g., Abernethy v. IRS, 909

subsection (e)(7) Privacy Act rights to allow agency to collect information
regarding employee’s exercise of religious beliefs so that accommodation could
be established).
Agencies are permitted to maintain a record describing how any individual exercises
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment that are pertinent to and within the scope of
an authorized law enforcement activity; the circuits are split on the appropriate standard
by which to determine if a record is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized
law enforcement activity.
Finally, agencies may maintain record describing how any individual exercises
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment “pertinent to and within the scope of
an authorized law enforcement activity.”
The Third, Sixth, and D.C. Circuit Courts of Appeals have adopted a “relevance”
standard to assess whether information is within the scope of the “law
enforcement activity” exception. See Patterson v. FBI, 893 F.2d 595, 602-03 (3d
Cir. 1990) (affirming dismissal of student’s subsection (e)(7) claim, and
concluding that a standard of “relevance” to a lawful law enforcement activity is
“more consistent with Congress’s intent and will prove to be a more manageable
standard than employing one based on ad-hoc review”); Jabara v. Webster, 691
F.2d 272, 279-80 (6th Cir. 1982) (holding that FBI’s overseas surveillance records
were “relevant to an authorized criminal investigation or to an authorized

(quoting Jabara, 691 F.2d at 280).
The Courts of Appeals for the Eleventh and the Ninth Circuits adopted narrower
standards, however. See MacPherson v. IRS, 803 F.2d at 482-85 (ruling ruled that
applicability of exception could be assessed only on “individual, case-by-case
basis” and that “hard and fast standard” was inappropriate, but concluding that
agency appropriately maintained notes and purchased tapes of tax protester’s
speech as “necessary to give the [IRS and Justice Department] a complete and
representative picture of the events,” notwithstanding that no investigation of
specific violation of law was involved and no past, present, or anticipated illegal
conduct was revealed or even suspected); Clarkson v. IRS, 678 F.2d at 1374-75

held that exception does not apply if record is “unconnected to any investigation
of past, present or anticipated violations of statutes [the agency] is authorized to
enforce”).
The circuits also are split on how long a record describing an individual’s First
Amendment activities continue to be “pertinent” to an authorized law enforcement
investigation.
The circuits have generally interpreted the law enforcement exception broadly
and concluded that it applies to closed investigative files. For example, the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit interpreted the law
enforcement exception in a closed investigation and concluded that, because
“[m]aterials may continue to be relevant to a law enforcement activity long after
a particular investigation undertaken pursuant to that activity has been closed,”
“[i]nformation that was pertinent to an authorized law enforcement activity
when collected does not later lose its pertinence to that activity simply because
the information is not of current interest (let alone ‘necessity’) to the agency.” J.
Roderick MacArthur Found. v. FBI, 102 F.3d 600, 602-03 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The
panel majority held that the Privacy Act does not require an agency to expunge
records when they are no longer pertinent to a current law enforcement activity.
Id. at 605; see also Afifi v. Lynch, 101 F. Supp. 3d 90, 107 (D.D.C. 2015) (finding
that closed investigation of plaintiff did not render FBI records invalid under
section (e)(7) because records may permit “the FBI to verify or evaluate any new
intelligence received, assess the reliability of other sources, and ensure
accountability regarding how the FBI responded to the information it received”);
Bassiouni v. FBI, 436 F.3d 712, 724-25 (7th Cir. 2006) (rejecting plaintiff’s
argument in national security context that FBI must be “currently involved in
law enforcement investigation” for exception to apply, concluding that FBI was
not required “to purge, on a continuous basis, properly collected information
with respect to individuals that the agency has good reason to believe may be
relevant on a continuing basis in the fulfillment of the agency’s statutory
responsibilities”).
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressed the law enforcement
exception in the context of national security and reached a conclusion similar to
that in MacArthur. See Bassiouni v. FBI, 436 F.3d at 723-25. At issue in
Bassiouni was whether the law enforcement exception covered the FBI’s
maintenance of records pertaining to a law professor who once presided over
two Arab-American associations. 436 F.3d at 724. The court found that records
maintained by the FBI for the purpose of national security (specifically,
intelligence related to international terrorism) was within subsection (e)(7)’s law
enforcement activity exception even though the FBI was not at the time involved

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

in a law enforcement activity or investigation. Id. at 723-25. The court reached
its decision based on the FBI’s assertion that it needed to maintain the records
because (1) the FBI had amended its investigative activities to make protection of
the United States against terrorist attack its top priority, (2) the FBI anticipated
“that it [would] continue to receive information about [the plaintiff]” owing to
“the nature of these investigative activities” and “the breadth of [the plaintiff’s]
contacts with the Middle East,” and (3) “the records [were] important for
evaluating the continued reliability of [the FBI’s] intelligence sources.” Id. at
724. The court opined that these purposes “fall within ‘authorized law
enforcement activity’ conducted by the FBI,” noting that “the realm of national
security belongs to the executive branch, and we owe considerable deference to
that branch’s assessment in matters of national security.” Id.
Other courts have taken a similar approach in the national security context.
Palmieri v. United States, 896 F.3d 579, 585-86 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (holding that
Naval Criminal Investigative Service did not violate subsection (e)(7) when it
assembled records concerning a government contractor’s exercise of his First
Amendment activities, including his associations and travel with Syrian
nationals, and quoting Maydak, 363 F.3d at 517, to conclude that “law
enforcement activities” is “interpreted . . . broadly to include an authorized
criminal, intelligence, or administrative investigation”) (internal citation and
quotation marks omitted).
The Ninth Circuit, however, recently held that “unless a record is pertinent to an
ongoing authorized law enforcement activity, an agency may not maintain it
under § (e)(7) of the Privacy Act.” Garris v. FBI, 937 F.3d at 1288 (9th Cir. 2019).
As the term “maintain” is defined by the Privacy Act to include both maintain
and collect, the court strictly interpreted subsection (e)(7) to read that the record
at issue must be pertinent to an authorized law enforcement activity both at the
time of collection and at the time of maintenance. Id. at 1295. The court further
found that its interpretation was consistent with its findings and holding in
MacPherson, 803 F.2d at 481-84, which upheld the maintenance of MacPherson’s
public speeches on tax protests, and also Becker v. IRS, 34 F.3d 398, 409 (7th Cir.
1994), where the 7th Circuit held that the IRS did not sufficiently justify the
maintenance of documents in Becker’s files. Id. at 1296. The court in Garris also
relied on Bassiouni, at 724-25, which concluded that the FBI’s continued
maintenance of records describing Bassiouni’s First Amendment activities did
not violate § (e)(7) of the Privacy Act, because “the act ha[d] no separate and
distinct maintenance requirement, but rather . . . the records were of continuing
relevance to an authorized law enforcement activity.” Id.
Finally, the Ninth Circuit in Garris distinguished the D.C. Circuit’s decision in J.
[191]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Roderick MacArthur Found., 102 F.3d 600, finding that the verb “maintain” is
“pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity”
exception, and not just to the record itself. Id. at 1297. The court in Garris
reasoned that first, “the ‘pertinent to ... an authorized law enforcement activity’
clause does not modify only the noun ‘record,’ because the noun ‘record’ cannot
be divorced from the verb ‘maintain’; second, the D.C. Circuit majority’s reading
also requires reading into the text words not written by Congress, that is, by
inserting the record is before ‘pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized
law enforcement activity,’ rather than relying on the word “maintain” at the
beginning of the (e)(7), which is a term explicitly defined in the Privacy Act; and
third, Congress demonstrated its ability to limit certain provisions of the Privacy
Act to only to collection, and not maintenance, as shown in subsections (e)(2),
(k)(2), and (k)(5). Id. at 1297-98. Although the investigation into Garris had
concluded, the court found that the retention of the FBI memo on Garris could
still be pertinent to an unauthorized law enforcement activity. Id. at 1298. The
court concluded though that the FBI memo and threat assessment herein did not
reveal a threat to national security, any direct nexus to terrorism, or a threat of
compromising current FBI investigations, and did not show was relevant to a
broader authorized law enforcement activity that might require its maintenance.
Id. In closing, the court in Garris stated the following:
Thus, we hold that to maintain a record, the government must
demonstrate that the maintenance of the record is pertinent to a specific
authorized law enforcement activity. We want to be exceedingly clear.
We are not holding that whenever an agency closes an investigation,
the agency must expunge the file because the law enforcement activity
for which the record was created (or received) has ended. What we are
holding is that, if the investigation is closed (or even if it is not), and if
the government cannot articulate a sufficient law enforcement activity
to which the maintenance of the record is pertinent, the maintenance
of the record violates the Privacy Act. The reason for maintenance, so
long as it is valid and not pretextual, need not be the same reason the
record was created. Thus, in plenty of cases, the end of an investigation
will not require a record to be expunged because the maintenance of
the record will have some pertinence to an articulable, authorized law
enforcement activity … Maintenance for maintenance's sake, without
pertinence to national security or other authorized law enforcement
activity, is precisely what the Act was intended to prevent.

could not “be helpful in future enforcement activity;” court, however, appeared
to confusingly engraft the timeliness requirement of subsection (e)(5) onto
subsection (e)(7) and to confuse access under subsection (k)(2) with
requirements of subsection (e)(7)); cf. J. Roderick MacArthur Found. v. FBI, 102

Courts have upheld the subsection (e)(7) law enforcement exception in numerous and
varied law enforcement contexts.
The courts have upheld the law enforcement exception’s applicability in a
variety of contexts. See Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d 1346, 1354-55, 1360-61 (D.C. Cir.
1991) (holding that appellant was foreclosed from obtaining relief because he
had “not suffered any adverse effect,” and (e)(7) was not violated because law
enforcement exception applied to FBI records concerning investigation of
appellant’s “unauthorized possession of an explosive device” and reported
advocacy of “violent overthrow of the Government”); Wabun-Inini v. Sessions,

HHS is empowered to enforce).
Courts have not upheld the subsection (e)(7) law enforcement exception where agencies
failed to demonstrate a link between the records and an authorized law enforcement
investigation.
However, some courts have not upheld the use of this exception where there
does not appear to be a link between the records and an investigation. See

when such process becomes a matter of public record.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(8).

This provision becomes applicable when subsection (b)(11) “court order”

requirements of this section, including any other rules and procedures adopted
pursuant to this section and the penalties for noncompliance.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(e)(9).
Comment:
Courts have given agencies deference on the manner by which they develop, and instruct
their employees on, their rules of conduct to satisfy the subsection (e)(9) requirement.
Pursuant to this provision, agencies are required to establish rules of conduct
governing the maintenance of systems of records but have broad latitude to
determine what those rules of conduct will be so long as the rules are
“reasonable.” “[A]gencies have broad discretion to [choose] among alternative
methods of securing their records commensurate with their needs, objectives,
procedures, and resources” and “[c]ivil liability is reserved for those lapses that
constitute an extraordinary departure from standards of reasonable conduct.”
Convertino v. DOJ, 769 F. Supp. 2d 139, 153 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Kostyu v.
United States, 742 F. Supp. 413, 417 (E.D. Mich.1990)), rev’d and remanded on
other grounds, 684 F.3d 93 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (reversing district court’s summary
judgment and ruling that district court committed abuse of discretion in denying
appellant’s motion to stay summary judgment to allow for further discovery).
In Convertino, the court concluded that the Privacy Act “only requires that each
covered employee understand the proper handling of systems of records over
which he or she has responsibility as well as records that he or she is responsible
for maintaining” and “[j]ust because certain DOJ employees did not associate
their knowledge and training regarding records system management with the
words ‘Privacy Act’ does not mean that they were not, in fact, properly
instructed in records system management.” Convertino v. DOJ, 769 F. Supp. 2d
at 153-54; see also Doe v. DOJ, 660 F. Supp. 2d 31, 43 (D.D.C. 2009) (“[A]lthough
plaintiff suggests that DOJ violated (e)(9) by failing to formally train [an agency
employee], the Privacy Act does not specify how the agency must ‘instruct’ its
personnel, and plaintiff has provided no support for his suggestion that listing
rules and requirements on the Internet is inappropriate.” (citations omitted));

5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(10) - Establish Safeguards
“Each agency that maintains a system of records shall -...
(10) establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any
anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in
substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual
on whom information is maintained.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(10).
Comment:
Some, but not all, courts have deferred to agencies on the manner by which they
promulgate rules or implement administrative, technical, or physical safeguards to
satisfy the subsection (e)(10) requirement.
This provision may come into play when documents are allegedly “leaked” or an
agency allegedly fails to adequately safeguard documents. See, e.g., Pilon v.
DOJ, 796 F. Supp. 7, 13 (D.D.C. 1992) (stating that because subsection (e)(10) is
more specific than subsection (b), it governs with regard to allegedly inadequate
safeguards that resulted in disclosure); Kostyu v. United States, 742 F. Supp. at
414-17 (finding alleged lapses in IRS document-security safeguards were not
willful and intentional); cf. Paige v. DEA, 665 F.3d 1355, 1361 (D.C. Cir. 2012)
(finding that even though plaintiff did not raise subsection (e)(10) claim at
district court and finding no violation of subsection (b), stating “the widespread
circulation of the accidental discharge video demonstrates the need for every
federal agency to safeguard video records with extreme diligence in this internet
age of iPhones and YouTube with their instantaneous and universal reach;
DEA’s treatment of the video-recording – particularly the creation of so many
different versions and copies – undoubtedly increased the likelihood of
disclosure and, although not an abuse of a system of records, is far from a model
of agency treatment of private data”).
Although section (e)(10) requires agencies to enact appropriate safeguards, “the
Act does not prescribe specific technical standards, leaving the agencies to
manage their own information security.” Atkins v. Mabus, No. 12CV1390, 2014
WL 2705204, at *5,*7 (S.D. Cal. June 13, 2014) (finding plaintiff’s evidentiary

showing regarding “appropriateness” of agency’s safeguards sufficient to
withstand summary judgment, but ultimately granting summary judgment for
agency because plaintiff failed to demonstrate willful or intentional failure to
safeguard), rev’d & remanded on other grounds, 654 F. App’x 878 (9th Cir. 2016).
Similarly, where an agency has made efforts to promulgate rules or enact
safeguards, the courts have generally relied on those steps as a sufficient agency
defense. Dick v. Holder, 67 F. Supp. 3d 167, 186 (D.D.C. 2014) (granting motion
to dismiss on basis that “DOJ, and by extension the FBI, has ‘promulgated
extensive regulations . . . that safeguard its Privacy Act-protected records” and
plaintiff “failed to identify any rule or safeguard that was breached or that
should have been in place but was not” (quoting Doe v. DOJ, 660 F. Supp. 2d 31,
43 (D.D.C. 2009))); Thompson v. State, 400 F. Supp. 2d 1, 23 (D.D.C. 2005)
(concluding that “a reasonable jury could not find that this failure amounted to a
reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights” where agency kept record “in a sealed
envelope that was addressed to [plaintiff] and clearly marked ‘To Be Opened
Only by Addressee,’” but did not “take the further precaution of keeping
confidential information in a locked file cabinet” (internal quotation marks
omitted)), aff’d, 210 F. App’x 5 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (unpublished tabled decision); see
also Conyers v. VA, No. 16CV00013, 2018 WL 1867106, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 29,
2018) (magistrate’s recommendation) (dismissing for failure to state claim
because plaintiff “fail[ed] to identify any specific rule or regulation that the [VA]
failed to develop or implement”) (citing Doe, 660 F. Supp. 2d at 43), adopted,
(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2018); Delaittre v. Berryhill, No. C15-1905, 2017 WL 6310483, at
*3, *5 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 11, 2017) (non-Privacy Act case rejecting plaintiff’s
motion to lift confidentiality designations of documents citing agency’s
obligations under (e)(10)). Another district court has held that conclusory
allegations predicated on the fact that confidential information was forwarded to
an unintended recipient are not sufficient to establish a subsection (e)(10)
violation. See Fleury v. USPS, No. 00-5550, 2001 WL 964147, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Aug.
21, 2001).
Courts have found that repeated warnings of information security risks that go unheeded
can be evidence of a willful or intentional failure to safeguard systems of records in
accordance with the subsection (e)(10) requirement.
Even so, however, the agency’s authority is not without limits. For example,
repeated warnings of information security risks that go unheeded are evidence
of a willful or intentional failure to safeguard. Compare In re OPM Data Sec.
Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (OPM’s decision “to continue
operating in the face of [] repeated and forceful [information security] warnings,
without implementing even the basic steps needed to minimize the risk of a

significant data breach, is precisely the type of willful failure to establish
appropriate safeguards that makes out a claim under the Privacy Act.”) and
AFGE v. Hawley, 543 F. Supp. 2d 44, 52 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding that
plaintiff’salleged “recurring, systemic, and fundamental deficiencies in
[defendant’s] information security,” as demonstrated in an Office of Inspector
General report, “if proven, would support a finding that defendants were
warned of the deficiencies in their information security but failed to establish
proper safeguards”), with Kelley v. FBI, 67 F. Supp. 3d 240, 263-64 (D.D.C. 2014)
(finding that “citation of multiple [media] articles does not suffice to create an
inference of intentional and willful failure to establish safeguards, especially
since the entities involved already had several published safeguards in place.”).
One district court has found that disclosures that are the result of “official
decisions” by an agency “cannot be the basis for a claim under subsection
(e)(10).” Chasse v. DOJ, No. 1:98-CV-207, slip op. at 16-17 (D. Vt. Jan. 14, 1999)
(magistrate’s recommendation), adopted, (D. Vt. Feb. 9, 1999), aff’d on other
grounds sub nom. Devine v. United States, 202 F.3d 547 (2d Cir. 2000).
Additionally, another district court held that a genuine issue of material fact
existed as to whether the VA intentionally or willfully violated subsection (e)(10)
by failing to install “patches” on its computer system to allow tracing of a user’s
access to the social security numbers of certain employees. See Schmidt v. VA,
218 F.R.D. 619, 634-35 (E.D. Wis. 2003).
To establish that an agency violated the subsection (e)(10) requirement, an individual
must establish an adverse effect and causation between the agency’s violation and the
established adverse effect.
In order to state a claim under the Privacy Act for a violation of this subsection,
plaintiffs must allege that an agency’s failure to comply “ha[d] an adverse effect”
on him and establish a “causal connection between the agency violation and the
adverse effect.” Lugo v. DOJ, 214 F. Supp. 3d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2016), citing Doe v.
DOJ, 660 F. Supp. 2d 31, 49 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Mandel v. OPM, 244 F. Supp.

5 U.S.C. § 552a(f)(3) - Establish Procedures for Disclosure of Records to
Individuals
“The rules shall –
...
(3) establish procedures for the disclosure to an individual upon his request of
his record or information pertaining to him, including special procedure, if
deemed necessary, for the disclosure to an individual of medical records,
including psychological records, pertaining to him.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(f)(3).
Comment:
Many, but not all, courts have held that agency rules for the disclosure of medical records
to an individual may not create, in effect, a new substantive exemption from accessing
such medical records not otherwise authorized by the Privacy Act; agencies, however,
have the freedom to promulgate special procedures to limit the potential harm from such
access.
In the past, a typical regulation consistent with this provision would have
allowed an agency to advise an individual requester that his medical records
would be provided through a designated physician who would determine which
records should be disclosed to the individual. However, as a result of a Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit opinion, Benavides v. BOP, 995 F.2d
269 (D.C. Cir. 1993), such regulations are no longer valid. In Benavides, the D.C.
Circuit held that subsection (f)(3) is “strictly procedural . . . merely authoriz[ing]
agencies to devise the manner in which they will disclose properly requested
non-exempt records” and that “[a] regulation that expressly contemplates that
the requesting individual may never see certain medical records [as a result of
the discretion of the designated physician] is simply not a special procedure for
disclosure to that person.” Id. at 272. The D.C. Circuit concluded that the Justice
Department’s subsection (f)(3) regulation at issue, 28 C.F.R. § 16.43(d) (1992), “in
effect, create[d] another substantive exemption” to Privacy Act access, and was,
therefore, “ultra vires.” 995 F.2d at 272-73.
Nevertheless, the D.C. Circuit in Benavides rejected the argument that the
Privacy Act requires direct disclosure of medical records to the individual.
Recognizing the “potential harm that could result from unfettered access to
medical and psychological records,” the court provided that “as long as agencies
guarantee the ultimate disclosure of the medical records to the requesting
individual . . . they should have freedom to craft special procedures to limit the

potential harm.” Id. at 273; accord Bavido v. Apfel, 215 F.3d 743, 748-50 (7th Cir.
2000) (finding that the “Privacy Act clearly directs agencies to devise special
procedures for disclosure of medical records in cases in which direct
transmission could adversely affect a requesting individual,” but that “these
procedures eventually must lead to disclosure of the records to the requesting
individual”; further finding exhaustion “not required” because agency’s
regulations “trapped” plaintiff by requiring him to “formally designate[] a
representative” and “[t]o name such a representative would amount to
conceding his case”); Melvin v. SSA, No. 5:09-CV-235, 2010 WL 1979880, at *5 &
n.3 (E.D.N.C. May 13, 2010) (explaining that “SSA amended the regulation [at
issue in Bavido] in such a way that ensures the ultimate disclosure of records”
and, therefore, allowing plaintiff to proceed with her Privacy Act claims), aff’d
per curiam, 442 F. App’x 870 (4th Cir. 2011); cf. Simmons v. Reno, No. 97-2167,
1998 WL 964228, at *1 (6th Cir. Dec. 29, 1998) (citing Benavides and questioning
district court’s reliance on SSA regulation that required designation of medical
representative for receipt of all medical records), vacating & remanding No.
4:96CV214 (W.D. Mich. Sept. 30, 1997).
As a result of the Benavides decision, prior case law applying (and thus
implicitly upholding) subsection (f)(3) regulations, such as the Justice
Department’s former regulation on this point, is unreliable. See, e.g., Cowsen-El
v. DOJ, 826 F. Supp. 532, 535-37 (D.D.C. 1992); Becher v. Demers, No. 91-C-99-S,

683 F.2d 420 (D.C. Cir. 1982).
Nevertheless, some courts, without addressing the holding in Benavides, have
upheld the denial of access pursuant to agency regulations that require the
designation of a representative to review medical records. See Hill v. Blevins,
No. 3-CV-92-0859, slip op. at 5-7 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 12, 1993) (finding SSA procedure

was “capable of repetition” it had “not been shown to evade review”).
Although there is no counterpart provision qualifying a requester’s independent
right of access to his medical records under the FOIA, the D.C. Circuit found it
unnecessary in Benavides to confront this issue. See 995 F.2d at 273. In fact, only
two courts have addressed the matter of separate FOIA access and the possible
applicability of 5 U.S.C. § 552a(t)(2) (addressing access interplay between Privacy
Act and FOIA), one of which was the lower court in a companion case to
Benavides. See Smith v. Quinlan, No. 91-1187, 1992 WL 25689, at *4 (D.D.C. Jan.
13, 1992) (stating court did “not find Section 552a(f)(3) as implemented [by 28
C.F.R. § 16.43(d)] and Section 552a(t)(2) to be incompatible”; reasoning that “if
Congress had intended Section 552a(t) to disallow or narrow the scope of special
procedures that agencies may deem necessary in releasing medical and
psychological records, it would have so indicated by legislation”), rev’d &

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

CIVIL REMEDIES
The Privacy Act provides four separate and distinct civil causes of action. See 5
U.S.C. § 552a(g). Two civil causes of action provide for injunctive relief – amendment
lawsuits under (g)(1)(A) and access lawsuits under (g)(1)(B). The remaining two
causes of action provide for compensatory relief in the form of monetary damages –
damages lawsuits under (g)(1)(C) and (g)(1)(D).
A. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A) - Amendment Lawsuits
“Whenever any agency . . . makes a determination under subsection (d)(3) . . .
not to amend an individual’s record in accordance with his request, or fails to
make such review in conformity with that subsection . . . the individual may
bring a civil action against the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A).
Comment:
When an agency does not amend an individual’s record as requested or does not
otherwise comply with the requirements of subsection (d)(3) -- which also
establishes, e.g., time limits and notification requirements -- the Privacy Act
specifically authorizes individuals to seek redress in federal court. This section
discusses the requirements for such amendment lawsuits.
1.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
Individuals must exhaust their administrative remedies prior to bringing
amendment suits against an agency.
In order to pursue a civil action for amendment of a record, an individual
must exhaust administrative remedies by making an amendment request to
the agency and requesting administrative review. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2)(3). The requirement to make an amendment request to the agency and to
seek administrative review before filing an action in civil court is
jurisdictional in nature because it is imposed by the Act itself. As explained
in greater detail below under “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(B) - Access Lawsuits,” it
is important to note that the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies
in Privacy Act access lawsuits is only jurisprudential in nature, as it is not
imposed by the Act itself.
The exhaustion principle is well established in the Privacy Act case law in
the amendment context. Courts have consistently required the individual to
file a request for amendment of his or her records, in conformity with the
[206]

plaintiff argued that by denying her request for access the agency had
prevented her from exercising her right to request amendment. See Smith v.

n.15 (holding that plaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies by
requesting amendment of records even though plaintiffs had argued that
“they cannot ask the CIA[] to amend that which the CIA refuses to admit
exists”).
In amendment suits, exhaustion of administrative processes generally includes
exhaustion of administrative appeals.
In addition, many courts have required an individual to administratively
appeal the agency’s denial of his or her amendment request before
commencing a subsection (g)(1)(A) lawsuit. See Jernigan v. Air Force, No.

[208]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

An agency’s failure to meet its own deadlines does not exempt an individual from
the exhaustion requirement; court jurisdiction exists, however, as soon as an agency
fails to comply with the amendment provision’s administrative appeal time
requirement.
Although subsection (d)(2)(A) requires an agency to “acknowledge in
writing such receipt” of an amendment request within ten working days,
subsection (d)(2)(B) merely requires an agency to “promptly” make the
requested correction or inform the individual of its refusal to amend. In
construing this language, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit has held that “[t]he statute provides no exemption from
administrative review when an agency fails, even by several months, to
abide by a deadline, and none is reasonably implied.” Dickson v. OPM, 828
F.2d 32, 40-41 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (requiring exhaustion of subsection (d)(3)
administrative appeal remedy even when agency did not respond to initial
amendment request for 90 days (citing Nagel, 725 F.2d at 1440-41)). But see
Schaeuble v. Reno, 87 F. Supp. 2d 383, 389-90 (D.N.J. 2000) (holding further
exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required where plaintiff had
requested amendment and agency had not responded for six months;
stating that “[a] six month delay is not a ‘prompt’ response,” and that
“[m]oreover, not only has the [agency] not indicated that it will make a final
determination . . . by any certain date, the Privacy Act does not bind the
[agency] to any definite timeframe for administrative action, which weighs
in favor of waiving the exhaustion requirement”).
In contrast to subsection (d)(2)(B), subsection (d)(3) requires an agency to
make a final determination on administrative appeal from an initial denial
of an amendment request within 30 working days (unless, for good cause
shown, the head of the agency extends this 30-day period). Thus, court
jurisdiction exists as soon as an agency fails to comply with the time
requirements of subsection (d)(3); “[t]o require further exhaustion would
not only contradict the plain words of the statute but also would undercut
[C]ongress’s clear intent to provide speedy disposition of these claims.”
Diederich v. Army, 878 F.2d 646, 648 (2d Cir. 1989).
Individuals who are not informed of their right to administratively appeal an agency
decision are treated as having “exhausted” administrative remedies.
After denying an amendment request, an agency must inform the
complainant of the right to administratively appeal that denial or the
complainant is not penalized for failing to exhaust his or her administrative
remedies before filing a civil action. In Harper v. Kobelinski, 589 F.2d 721
[209]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

(D.C. Cir. 1978) (per curiam), and Liguori v. Alexander, 495 F. Supp. 641
(S.D.N.Y. 1980), the agencies denied amendment requests but failed to
inform the plaintiffs of their rights to administratively appeal those
decisions. In light of the Act’s requirement that agencies inform
complainants whose amendment requests have been denied of the available
administrative remedies, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2)(B)(ii), the courts in Harper
and Liguori refused to penalize the plaintiffs for their failures to exhaust.
Harper, 589 F.2d at 723; Liguori, 495 F. Supp. at 646-47; see also Germane v.
Heckler, 804 F.2d 366, 369 (7th Cir. 1986) (discussing Harper and Liguori
with approval); Mahar v. Nat’l Parks Serv., No. 86-0398, slip op. at 7-11
(D.D.C. Dec. 23, 1987) (same); cf. Ertell v. Army, 626 F. Supp. 903, 909-10
(C.D. Ill. 1986) (rejecting agency’s exhaustion defense where it first told
employee, in response to his amendment request, that it had destroyed the
record but later used same record against him, ruling that employee was not
required to make new request or appeal initial action).
The D.C. Circuit has held that individuals must seek judicial review of adverse
employment decisions under the Administrative Procedures Act prior to filing civil
Privacy Act suit.
D.C. courts have held that civil suits may not be filed until the individual
has sought judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act
(“APA”). For example, in White v. U.S. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 589 F.2d 713,
715-16 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (per curiam), the D.C. Circuit held that,
notwithstanding any exhaustion of administrative remedies, an amendment
action is “inappropriate and premature” where the individual had not yet
sought judicial review (under the APA) of adverse employment decisions,
because granting Privacy Act relief “would tend to undermine the
established and proven method by which individuals . . . have obtained
review from the courts.” Cf. Douglas v. Farmers Home Admin., No. 911969, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9159, at *4-5 (D.D.C. June 26, 1992) (dismissing
damages action under Privacy Act where plaintiff had not sought review
under Administrative Procedure Act of allegedly inaccurate property
appraisal). But see Churchwell v. United States, 545 F.2d 59, 61 (8th Cir.
1976) (finding probationary employee could proceed with due process claim
for hearing even though Privacy Act remedy was available to her because
“the failure to pursue one particular remedy has [no] bearing on the
viability of the other form of relief”).

Standard and Scope of Review
“In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(A) of this

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

section, the court may order the agency to amend the individual’s record in
accordance with his request or in such other way as the court may direct. In
such a case the court shall determine the matter de novo.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(2)(A).
Comment:
After an individual exhausts his or her administrative remedies by making
an amendment request to the agency and requesting administrative review
pursuant to subsections (d)(2) and (d)(3), the individual may challenge the
agency’s refusal to amend the individual’s record in federal district court. In
such amendment actions, brought under subsection (g)(1)(A), “the court
may order the agency to amend the individual’s record in accordance with
his request or in such other way as the court may direct,” and “may assess
against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs
reasonably incurred” in any case in which the complainant has
“substantially prevailed.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(2)(A), (B).
Amendment suits are reviewed in the federal courts de novo.
In a subsection (g)(1)(A) action, the court “shall determine the matter de
novo.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(2)(A). “De novo review does not contemplate that
the court will substitute its judgment for the [agency’s], but rather that the
court will undertake an independent determination of whether the
amendment request should be denied.” Nolan v. DOJ, No. 89-A-2035, 1991
WL 134803, at *3 (D. Colo. July 17, 1991), appeal dismissed in pertinent part
on procedural grounds, 973 F.2d 843 (10th Cir. 1992); see also Doe v. United
States, 821 F.2d 694, 697-98 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (holding that “[d]e novo means
. . . a fresh, independent determination of ‘the matter’ at stake”). The
applicable standards in amendment lawsuits are accuracy, relevancy,
timeliness, and completeness. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2)(B)(i). But see Doe v.
United States, 821 F.2d at 697 n.8, 699 (stating that “whether the nature of
the relief sought is injunctive or monetary, the standard against which the
accuracy of the record is measured remains constant” and “[t]hat standard is

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Individuals may not bring civil suit for an agency’s failure to amend records that do
not exist.
“[A]n individual’s request for amendment must relate to an existing record
that is maintained within one of the agency’s systems of records.”
Crummey v. SSA, 794 F. Supp. 2d 46, 58 (D.D.C. 2011), aff’d per curiam, No.
11-5231, 2012 WL 556317 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 6, 2012). The plaintiff in Crummey
– who “believe[d] that the Social Security Administration created a trust . . .
when it assigned him a Social Security Number and a Social Security Card”
– had “draft[ed] an agreement designed to reflect the alleged creation of the
Trust.” 794 F. Supp. 2d at 49. The plaintiff brought a subsection (g)(1)(A)
claim seeking a court order requiring the SSA “to amend its records to add
the Trust Agreement to the SSA’s Master Files, or to somehow incorporate
its contents therein.” Id. at 52. The court reviewed the categories of records
listed in the applicable system of records notice, see 75 Fed. Reg. 82,123
(Dec. 29, 2010), and determined that “[n]one of the information set forth in
the Trust Agreement falls within this universe.” 794 F. Supp. 2d at 58. “In
short,” the court concluded, “the Trust Agreement and the information
contained therein do not correspond to an ‘item, collection, or grouping’ of
information in the Master Files,” and granted summary judgment to the
SSA. Id. at 59.
Once records have been amended, the amendment claim is moot.
Once a request for amendment is complied with and the identified records
have been amended, the amendment claim is moot. See, e.g., Conley, 2011
WL 1256611, at *7; Blanton v. Warden, No. 7:10-cv-00552, 2011 WL 1226010,
at *2-3 (W.D. Va. Mar. 30, 2011); Garza v. Pearson, No. 5:08-cv-300, 2009 WL

(D.D.C. 1997), summary affirmance granted, No. 97-5330, 1998 WL 315583
(D.C. Cir. May 12, 1998).
There are several matters that are not subject to court review under the amendment
provisions of the Privacy Act, including tax liability determinations, judicial and
quasi-judicial decisions, and criminal convictions and sentences.
Tax liability determinations are not subject to court review under the
Privacy Act. In the Internal Revenue Code, Congress expressly removed the
jurisdiction of the district courts under Privacy Act subsection (g) to order
the amendment of IRS records concerning tax liability. 26 U.S.C. § 7852(e)
(providing that subsection (g), as well as subsections (d)(2), (3) and (4),
“shall not apply, directly or indirectly,” to any “determination of the

curiam).
In addition, consistent with the OMB 1975 Guidelines, courts have routinely
expressed disfavor toward litigants who attempt to invoke the subsection
(g)(1)(A) amendment remedy as a basis for collateral attacks on judicial or
quasi-judicial determinations recorded in agency records. See 40 Fed. Reg.
at 28,969, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75; see also Jackson v.

quasi-judicial or administrative proceeding” lies “outside the scope of the
Privacy Act”); Jones v. MSPB, 216 F. App’x 608, 609 (8th Cir. 2007) (affirming

exist to allow applicants to obtain such a ‘do-over’ of their security forms in
the guise of an administrative ‘correction’”); Doe v. HHS, 871 F. Supp. 808,
814-15 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (“[T]he specific reporting provisions encompassed in
the [Health Care Quality Improvement] Act supersede[] any claims

Criminal court convictions and sentences are generally not subject to civil
amendment court review under the Privacy Act. Federal prisoners
frequently attempt to invoke the subsection (g)(1)(A) amendment remedy as
a basis for a collateral attack on a conviction or the duration of a sentence.
Just as in the damages context – discussed in the “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C) Damages Lawsuits for Failure to Assure Fairness in Agency Determination”
section, below – courts have frequently ruled that unless the conviction or
sentence has been invalidated in a prior proceeding, the prisoner’s exclusive
remedy is a writ of habeas corpus. See, e.g., Reeves v. BOP, 885 F. Supp. 2d
384, 389 (D.D.C. 2012) (“A civil action under the Privacy Act is not the
proper means by which a federal prisoner may secure a reduction in the

5903088, at *3 (W.D. Wis. Nov. 26, 2012) (holding that a prisoner’s claim to
amend his presentence report cannot succeed because the individual
defendants were immune and that BOP “cannot be ordered to amend
plaintiff’s presentence report because it has no authority to take such an
action”); King v. Johns, No. 4:10cv1835, 2010 WL 4065405, at *1 (N.D. Ohio
Oct. 14, 2010) (“[A] complaint seeking relief under . . . § 552a is not a
permissible alternative to a petition for writ of habeas corpus if the plaintiff
essentially challenges the legality of his confinement.”); Truesdale v. DOJ,
731 F. Supp. 2d 3, 11 (D.D.C. 2010) (dismissing Privacy Act claims because a
ruling in plaintiff’s favor would impact the duration of his confinement, and
should be brought in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus “not by way of a
suit brought under the Privacy Act”); Davis v. United States, No. 09-1961,
2010 WL 2011549, at *1 n.1 (D. Md. May 18, 2010) (“[T]o the extent Petitioner
believes that his sentence should be modified, such claims may only be
made in the context of a habeas petition.”); Brown v. BOP, 498 F. Supp. 2d.
298, 303-04 (D.D.C. 2007) (“The Privacy Act is not the proper means by
which a prisoner may collaterally attack his sentence absent a showing that
his sentence has been invalidated in a prior proceeding.”); Forrester v.
Parole Comm’n, 310 F. Supp. 2d 162, 168-70 (D.D.C. 2004) (concluding that
reaching plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim seeking order to expunge information
“would have a probabilistic impact on his confinement . . . and therefore
plaintiff may only raise [such a claim] in a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus”); Graham v. Hawk, 857 F. Supp. 38, 40-41 (W.D. Tenn. 1994) (“The
Privacy Act is not a means of circumventing [habeas] exhaustion
requirement.”), aff’d, 59 F.3d 170 (6th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table
decision). Similarly, the D.C. Circuit has concluded that the Privacy Act
amendment provisions do not allow for amendment of military records:
“The proper means by which to seek a change to military records is through
a proceeding before the . . . Board for Correction of Military Records,” not
under the Privacy Act. Glick v. Army, No. 91-5213, 1992 WL 168004, at *1
(D.C. Cir. June 5, 1992) (per curiam); see also Cargill v. Marsh, 902 F.2d 1006,
1007-08 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal of Privacy Act
claim and concluding proper means to seek substantive change in military
records is through proceeding before the Boards for Correction of Records);
Walsh v. Hagee, 900 F. Supp. 2d 51, 60 (D.D.C. 2012) (“For [plaintiff] to
obtain injunctive relief to amend his military record, he must proceed under
10 U.S.C. § 1552.”); Doe v. Navy, 764 F. Supp. 1324, 1327 (N.D. Ind. 1991)
(“[P]laintiff is not free to choose to attempt amendment of his military
records under the Privacy Act alone without resort to the records correction
board remedy.”); cf. Hardy, 692 F. Supp. 2d at 80-81 (rejecting claim seeking
correction of Army memorandum of reprimand including “implication that

[plaintiff] intentionally misrepresented his educational credentials” because
“the Army’s judgment is based on accurate facts” and because plaintiff
“presents the same facts that have been considered by various Army boards
and asks [the court] to substitute [its] judgment for theirs”); Walker v.
United States, No. 93-2728, 1998 WL 637360, at *14 (E.D. La. Sept. 16, 1998)
(citing Cargill and finding plaintiff’s claim “unavailing” to extent that he “is
attempting to use the Privacy Act as a vehicle for his collateral attack on the
Army’s allegedly improper failure to correct his military records”), aff’d, 184
F.3d 816 (5th Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision). But see Diederich v.
Army, 878 F.2d 646, 647-48 (2d Cir. 1989) (holding that “Privacy Act claims
were properly before the district court” and that plaintiff was not required
to further exhaust administrative remedies before asserting claim for
amendment of military records where his direct request to Army for
correction had been stalled before appeals board for several months); see
also Def. Priv. Bd., Advisory Opinions No. 4, Corrections of Military
Records Under the Privacy Act, in Judge Advocate General’s School, U.S.
Army, JA 235, Government Information Practices – Casebook, A-13 (March
2000), https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_ja-235 (affording review under
Privacy Act for factual matters only but noting that challenges to judgmental
decisions may be made to the Boards for Correction of Military or Naval
Records).
Finally, several courts have ruled that statutes that provide other avenues of
redress, such as the CSRA, can bar certain kinds of subsection (g)(1)(C)
damages actions. These cases are discussed below under “5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(1)(C) - Damages Lawsuits for Failure to Assure Fairness in Agency
Determination.”
The courts are split as to whether records that are exempt from the Privacy Act’s
access provision are also exempt from the Privacy Act’s amendment suits.
The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have
concluded that records that are exempt from access under the Privacy Act
are not subject to amendment suits. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit held that a plaintiff had no right to amend the record at issue even
though that record was only “exempt from the access requirements of the
Act.” Smith v. United States, 142 F. App’x 209, 210 (5th Cir. 2005) (per
curiam) (emphasis added). In other words, the court explained, “the scope
of accessibility and the scope of amendment under the Privacy Act are
coextensive.” Id. The plaintiff in Smith had sought to amend a report that
was “prepared in response to [his Federal Tort Claims Act] claim.” Id. The
Fifth Circuit explained that because this report “was prepared in reasonable
[218]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

anticipation of a civil suit or proceeding” within the meaning of the
subsection (d)(5) exemption, “[t]he report is . . . also exempt from the
amendment requirements of the Act.” Id. Thus, the court concluded, the
amendment claim was “barred by exemption.” Id. Subsection (d)(5) is
discussed below under “Ten Exemptions.”
The Smith court agreed with earlier cases in the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth and Seventh Circuits. The Ninth Circuit held that “Congress
intended to provide the remedies of amendment or expungement only for
records that are accessible under the Privacy Act.” Baker v. Navy, 814 F.2d
1381, 1385 (9th Cir. 1987) (finding that plaintiff’s ability to access record
under FOIA or because of personal knowledge of its existence, did not
permit him to amend record because it was not contained in system of
records as required for access by subsection (d)(1) of Privacy Act). Similarly,
the Seventh Circuit concluded that “you cannot amend a document if you
don’t have access to it.” Wentz v. DOJ, 772 F.2d 335, 338 (7th Cir. 1985)
(alternative holding) (concluding that amendment was not appropriate
because the record was exempt from access under subsection (d)(1),
pursuant to subsection (j)(2)).
The Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia, First, and Fourth
Circuits also have concluded that courts do not have jurisdiction under
subsection (g)(1)(A) to order the amendment of records addressed by the
Civil Service Reform Act’s (CSRA) comprehensive remedial scheme. See
Wills v. OPM, No. 93-2079, 1994 WL 22349, at *3-4 (4th Cir. Jan. 28, 1994)
(alternative holding) (per curiam) (unpublished table decision) (finding
jurisdiction was proper under CSRA where challenge to merits of statement
on SF-50 was actually complaint regarding adverse employment decision);

Remedies
The Privacy Act allows for broad injunctive remedies in amendment suits,
including expungement.
The Act provides for broad injunctive remedies, contemplating
“expungement [of inaccuracies] and not merely redress by supplement.”
R.R. v. Army, 482 F. Supp. 770, 774 (D.D.C. 1980); see also Smith v. Nixon,
807 F.2d 197, 204 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Hobson v. Wilson, 737 F.2d 1, 65-66 (D.C.
Cir. 1984), overruled in part on other grounds, Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty.
Narcotics Intel. & Coord. Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993).
Once an agency offers to destroy a record in response to an expungement
request, the lawsuit is at an end, and the agency cannot be compelled to
affirmatively determine and announce that the challenged record violated
the Act. See Reuber v. United States, 829 F.2d 133, 144-49 (D.C. Cir. 1987);
see also Comm. in Solidarity v. Sessions, 929 F.2d 742, 745 n.2 (D.C. Cir.
1991); Metadure Corp. v. United States, 490 F. Supp. 1368, 1375 (S.D.N.Y.
1980). But see Doe v. U.S. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 483 F. Supp. 539, 551
(S.D.N.Y. 1980).
The expungement remedy often is sought in cases asserting constitutional
claims in addition to Privacy Act claims, such as claims for violation of the
Fourth Amendment’s due process protections. As the District of Columbia
Circuit Court of Appeals has stated, “Congress’s provision of specific
Privacy Act remedies does not bar” a plaintiff’s equitable Constitutional
claims. Abdelfattah v. DHS, 787 F.3d 524, 534 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that
“[w]e have repeatedly recognized a plaintiff may request expungement of
agency records for both violations of the Privacy Act and the Constitution”);
see Chastain v. Kelley, 510 F.2d 1232, 1235-38 (D.C. Cir. 1975); Doe v. Air
Force, 812 F.2d 738, 740-41 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (explaining that expungement of
records seized from plaintiff’s Air Force barracks may be “available as a
remedy if it is determined that the retained copies and information were

unconstitutionally obtained”); Fendler v. Parole Comm’n, 774 F.2d 975, 979
(9th Cir. 1985); Ezenwa v. Gallen, 906 F. Supp. 978, 986 (M.D. Pa. 1995); cf.
Johnson v. Sessions, No. 92-201, 1992 WL 212408, at *2 (D.D.C. Aug. 19,
1992) (refusing to invoke equitable powers to expunge plaintiff’s arrest
record because court did not have jurisdiction to order FBI to violate its own
regulations which require FBI to wait for authorization from appropriate
judicial authority before expunging arrest record); NTEU v. IRS, 601 F.
Supp. 1268, 1273 (D.D.C. 1985) (“Although the [inherent equitable power to
order the expungement of a record] is most frequently employed to
vindicate express or implied constitutional or statutory rights . . . the
remedy need not always be so limited.”).
However, when such equitable remedies are requested pursuant solely to
the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction – “which recognizes federal courts’
jurisdiction over some matters (otherwise beyond their competence) that are
incidental to other matters” – the courts generally have not permitted
equitable expungement. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511
U.S. 375, 378 (1994). Following Kokkonen, a number of circuits have found
that Federal courts do not maintain “inherited” powers ancillary to its
original action to hear requests for equitable expungement of records;
jurisdiction must be grounded in the Constitution or by statute. United
States v. Wahi, 850 F.3d 296, 302 (7th Cir. 2017); Doe v. United States, 833
F.3d 192, 199 (2d Cir. 2016); United States v. Field, 756 F.3d 911, 916 (6th Cir.
2014); United States v. Coloian, 480 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 2007); United States
v. Meyer, 439 F.3d 855, 862 (8th Cir. 2006); United States v. Dunegan, 251
F.3d 477, 479 (3d Cir. 2001); United States v. Sumner, 226 F.3d 1005, 1014
(9th Cir. 2000).

5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(B) - Access Lawsuits
“Whenever any agency . . . refuses to comply with an individual request under
subsection (d)(1) of this section [the individual may bring a civil action against
the agency].” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(B).
Comment:
Subsection (g)(1)(B) authorizes an individual to bring a civil suit against an
agency that refuses to comply with the individual’s access request. Sovereign
immunity is not a defense in such cases. See In re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt.
Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 61 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (noting that Privacy Act
“provides . . . a waiver of sovereign immunity”); Braun v. USPS, No. 16-2079,
2017 WL 4325645, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept. 17, 2017) (concluding that Privacy Act

access lawsuit is not barred by sovereign immunity, because Act is statutory
waiver of such immunity).
1.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
Requesters must exhaust administrative remedies before filing access suits under
subsection (g)(1)(B); unlike amendment suits under subsection (g)(1)(A), the
exhaustion requirement in access suits is not jurisdictional.
Just as under the FOIA, a requester must comply with agency procedures
and exhaust all available administrative remedies – through pursuit of an
access request to the agency and, if that request is denied, through an
administrative appeal – prior to bringing a subsection (g)(1)(B) action.
The exhaustion requirement cannot be found in the language of the Privacy
Act itself, and arises instead from jurisprudential exhaustion principles.
Thus, it is not jurisdictional. Because “[t]he language in [subsections (d)(1)
and (g)] does not expressly require exhaustion of particular administrative
remedies,” there is no statutory requirement for exhaustion related to a
request for access to records. Taylor v. Treasury, 127 F.3d 470, 476 (5th Cir.
1997). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted that, “[w]henever
the Congress statutorily mandates that a claimant exhaust administrative
remedies, the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional because it is
tantamount to a legislative investiture of exclusive original jurisdiction in
the agency.” Id. at 475. However, in “the absence of a statutory
requirement of exhaustion . . . the jurisprudential doctrine of exhaustion
controls. . . . The jurisprudential exhaustion doctrine is not jurisdictional in
nature.” Id. (citations omitted). The Fifth Circuit concluded that the
plaintiff’s “failure to exhaust administrative remedies did not constitute a
jurisdictional bar to assertion of his claim [for access to records, but] . . .
application of the jurisprudential exhaustion doctrine in this case indicates
that . . . [plaintiff’s] claims under the Privacy Act must be dismissed for
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Id. at 476-77.
The Courts of Appeals for the Third and Ninth Circuits also have
recognized a jurisprudential exhaustion requirement in Privacy Act cases.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit followed Taylor and stated, “To
the extent exhaustion of administrative remedies is required, it is not a
jurisdictional prerequisite.” Wadhwa v. VA, 342 F. App’x 860, 862-63 (3d
Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (citing Taylor, 127 F.3d at 475-76) (emphasis added).
Rather, courts have required plaintiffs seeking access to records to exhaust
administrative remedies pursuant to the “jurisprudential exhaustion
[222]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

doctrine.” See, e.g., id. The Third Circuit “disagree[d] with the District
Court’s conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction to entertain [plaintiff’s] claim [for
access to records] under the Privacy Act because [plaintiff] failed to exhaust
his administrative remedies.” 342 F. App’x at 862. See also Buckley v.
Schaul, 135 F. App’x 960, 960 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that “even in the
absence of an explicit exhaustion requirement, a district court may in its
discretion require such exhaustion”).
As noted above in the section entitled, “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A) Amendment Lawsuits,” access lawsuits differ in this respect from
amendment lawsuits. See also, e.g., Kvech v. Holder, No. 10-cv-545, 2011
WL 4369452, at *8 (D.D.C. Sept. 19, 2011) (“While the Privacy Act requires
that plaintiffs first resort to administrative remedies for denials of requests
to amend records, . . . the statute does not contain a similar requirement
with respect to an access claim.”). Because subsection (d)(2) regarding
amendment by its terms requires exhaustion, that requirement is
jurisdictional in nature. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2); see also Quinn v. Stone,
978 F.2d 126, 137-38 (3d Cir. 1992) (“These provisions entail a requirement
that the plaintiff exhaust her administrative remedies before she can take
advantage of [subsection (g)(1)(A)]” (citing Dickson v. OPM, 828 F.2d 32, 4041 (D.C. Cir. 1987))). But see Singh v. DHS, No. 1:12cv00498, 2013 WL
1704296, at *10-12 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 19, 2013) (following Taylor, a Privacy Act
access case, and finding exhaustion requirement for the plaintiff’s
amendment claim as non-jurisdictional).
Plaintiffs’ access requests must conform to agency regulations to exhaust
administrative remedies.
Nearly all courts have concluded that plaintiffs fail to exhaust
administrative remedies if their access requests do not conform to agency
regulations. See, e.g., Vaughn v. Danzig, 18 F. App’x 122, 125 (4th Cir. 2001)
(per curiam) (affirming district court’s summary judgment for agency
because plaintiff’s “telephonic request for the record before it was destroyed
did not comply with the requirement for submitting a request under the
Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, or Navy regulations
implementing those statutes”); Taylor, 127 F.3d at 473-78 (upholding
dismissal of plaintiff’s request because plaintiff’s “Privacy Act requests
plainly did not comply with [agency] regulations because he did not list the
systems that he wished to have searched, their location, and the business
address of the systems officer”); Powell v. IRS, 317 F. Supp. 3d 266 (D.C.C.
2018) (concluding that plaintiff failed to exhaust all but one request because

In access suits, plaintiffs generally must file an administrative appeal to exhaust
administrative remedies.
The courts also generally have dismissed a plaintiff’s complaint for failure to
exhaust administrative remedies if the plaintiff did not file an administrative
appeal to an agency’s denial of the access request. See Lopez v. NARA, 301
F. Supp. 3d 78, 90 (D.D.C. 2018) (dismissing plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim for

2248711, at *2 (D.D.C. May 29, 2008) (excusing failure to file administrative

written explanation of the partial grant of [p]laintiff’s appeal as required by
[its] regulation”), aff’d, No. 01-2256 (1st Cir. June 12, 2002).
An agency’s failure to meet its own deadlines does not constructively exhaust an
individual’s administrative remedies.
The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and several district courts have
noted that an individual cannot “constructively exhaust” administrative
remedies under the Privacy Act – i.e., deem that administrative remedies are
exhausted where the agency failed to timely respond – because “the Privacy
Act contains no equivalent to FOIA’s ‘constructive exhaustion’ provision [5
U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)].” Pollack v. DOJ, 49 F.3d 115, 116 n.1, 118-19 (4th Cir.
1995) (indicating that only FOIA claim was properly before district court
because “Privacy Act contains no equivalent to FOIA’s ‘constructive
exhaustion’ provision which . . . enabled the district court to review his
FOIA request”); see also Kearns v. FAA, 312 F. Supp. 3d at 107 (D.D.C. 2018)
(concluding that although plaintiff argued that he “‘constructively
exhausted’ his Privacy Act claims, . . . the law is clear that such a route to
exhaustion is not available under the statute”); Gadd, 2010 WL 60953, at *12
(citing Pollack and dismissing access claim for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies); Barouch v. DOJ, 962 F. Supp. 2d at 68 (stating that
no equivalent constructive exhaustion provision exists under Privacy Act
and finding “that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with
respect to his [Privacy Act] request to EOUSA” and accordingly, court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction); Sussman v. DOJ, No. 03-3618, 2006 WL
2850608, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2006) (“The Privacy Act . . . does not allow

“since plaintiff has sought an action in equity, and has not exhausted his
administrative remedies through administrative appeal . . . plaintiff is
barred from seeking injunctive relief under the Privacy Act”).
An agency’s failure to comply with its own regulations, however, can

Standard and Scope of Review
Access suits are reviewed in the federal courts de novo.
The civil remedies subsection for access suits establishes parameters for such
suits, including the standard of judicial review. In civil actions for access,
courts “shall determine the matter de novo.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(3)(A). See
Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d 694, 697-98 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc); Barouch
v. DOJ, 87 F. Supp. 3d 10, 32 (D.D.C. 2015). Courts may review records in
camera to determine whether any of the exemptions set forth in subsection
(k) apply. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(3)(A). Furthermore, in Privacy Act access
cases, courts may rely on agency affidavits or declarations to enter summary
judgment in favor of the government, e.g., an affidavit describing search
terms and type of search performed to demonstrate that agency conducted
an adequate search. Elgabrowny v. CIA, No. 17-CV-00066, 2019 WL 1440345
(D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2019) (citing Chambers v. Interior, 568 F. 3d 998, 1003 (D.C.
Cir. 2009)). For more detailed discussions of these topics, see “Individual’s
Right of Access” section above and “Ten Exemptions, Seven Specific
Exemption Rules Agencies May Promulgate” section below.
Once an agency provides the requested records, any pending access claim is moot.
Several courts have recognized that jurisdiction to consider a Privacy Act
access claim exists only if the government has failed to comply with a
request for records; once a request is complied with and the responsive
records have been disclosed, a Privacy Act access claim is moot. See Jackson
v. Shinseki, 526 F. App’x 814, 817 (10th Cir. 2013) (affirming district court’s
decision that plaintiff’s claim was moot because “defendants had ‘provided
[appellant] with copies of all responsive documents in their possession,’
thus agency was ‘discharg[ed]of their obligations under the Privacy Act’”);
Campbell v. SSA, 446 F. App’x 477, 480 (3d Cir. 2011); Yonemoto v. VA, 305

(asserting that Privacy Act claim for access was moot where magistrate

Some courts have required plaintiffs to allege that an agency’s failure to provide
access was improper, not simply that the request was denied.
To maintain an access lawsuit under subsection (g)(1)(B), the plaintiff must
allege not only that access was requested and denied, but also that the
denial or failure to act on the request was improper. See Camper v. NSA,

Most courts have considered access to tax records under the Internal Revenue Code,
rather than the Privacy Act.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled that “the
specific provisions of [26 U.S.C.] § 6103 rather than the general provisions of
the Privacy Act govern the disclosure of . . . tax information” and that
“individuals seeking ‘return information’ . . . must do so pursuant to § 6103
of the Internal Revenue Code, rather than the Privacy Act.” Lake v. Rubin,
162 F.3d 113, 115-16 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In reaching this conclusion, the D.C.
Circuit looked to the legislative history of § 6103 and embraced an earlier
ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Cheek v. IRS, 703
F.2d 271, 272 (7th Cir. 1983) (per curiam), that similarly had held that § 6103
“displaces” the Privacy Act and shields tax return information from release
to a first-party requester. See also Kendrick v. Wayne Cnty., No. 10-13752,
2011 WL 2580675, at *1-2 (E.D. Mich. June 29, 2011); Paige v. IRS, No. 1P-8564-C, slip op. at 3-4 (S.D. Ind. Jan. 13, 1986); cf. Maxwell v. O’Neill, No. 0001953, 2002 WL 31367754, at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 12, 2002) (“while [section] 6103
may supersede the Privacy Act, it does not supersede the FOIA”), aff’d, No.
04-5082 (D.C. Cir. May 27, 2005). But cf. Sinicki v. Treasury, No. 97 CIV.
0901, 1998 WL 80188, at *3-5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 1998) (finding Cheek
unpersuasive in context of wrongful disclosure claim and denying motion to
dismiss Privacy Act claim, stating that “the language, structure, purpose
and legislative history of Section 6103 do not make manifest and clear a
legislative intent to repeal the Privacy Act as it applies to tax return
information”).
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has interpreted 26 U.S.C.
§ 7852(e) to likewise prevent Privacy Act access to records pertaining to tax
liability. Jacques v. IRS, 972 F.2d 1339 (unpublished disposition), 1992 WL

12, 1999). The Ninth Circuit’s rationale differs from the rationale applied by
the D.C. Circuit, however. Cf. Lake v. Rubin, 162 F.3d at 114-16 (affirming
judgments of district court “not on the jurisdictional rationale contained in”
opinions in the Ninth Circuit based on § 7852, which the D.C. Circuit

Remedies
Courts can order agencies to produce the requested records; monetary damages,
however, are not available in access cases.
In access lawsuits, courts can enjoin the agency from withholding records
and order their production to the individual. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(3)(A);
Kursar v. Transportation Sec. Admin., 581 F. Supp. 2d 7, 19 (D.D.C. 2008)

5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C) - Damages Lawsuits for Failure to Assure Fairness in
Agency Determination
“Whenever any agency . . . fails to maintain any record concerning any
individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is
necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications,
character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual that may be
made on the basis of such record, and consequently a determination is made
which is adverse to the individual . . . the individual may bring a civil action
against the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C).
Comment:
Subsection (g)(1)(C) allows individuals to sue an agency for failure to maintain records
with such “accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness” as is necessary to assure
fairness in agency determinations.
This section provides a civil remedy against an agency that does not maintain its
records in accordance with the requirements of section (e)(5) of the Privacy Act.
The standard for maintaining records under this provision is identical to the
standard under subsection (e)(5), which requires agencies to maintain records
used in making determinations about individuals “with such accuracy,
[231]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure
fairness to the individual in the determination.” See, e.g., Bettersworth v. FDIC,
248 F.3d 386, 390 n.3 (5th Cir. 2001) (explaining that the “statutory obligation”
imposed by subsection (e)(5) “is made enforceable by substantively identical
language in subsection 552a(g)(1)(C)”); Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d 694, 698
n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc) (concluding that agency record met accuracy
standard although subsection (e)(5) “uses the phrase ‘reasonably necessary to
assure fairness’ whereas subsection (g)(1)(C)] does not include the word
‘reasonably.’ We attribute no substantive significance, for the issue at hand, to
the omission of the word ‘reasonably’ in § 552a(g)(1)(C).”); Gard v. Dep’t of
Educ., 789 F. Supp. 2d 96, 106 (D.D.C. 2011) (explaining that claim alleging
violation of subsection (e)(5) “is entirely duplicative” of claim alleging violation
of subsection (g)(1)(C) because “[c]laims predicated upon violations of Section
552a(e)(5) . . . must be brought under 552a(g)(1)(C)”).
The key element of the standard – the necessity ‘to assure fairness in any
determination’ – calls for a balanced judgment, one inherently involving a
reasonableness criterion. Edison v. Army, 672 F.2d 840, 843 (11th Cir. 1982)
(concluding that although it “must be read in pari materia with subsection
(e)(5),” “[i]f the court determines that the agency has done what is reasonable in
assuring the accuracy of the information, no more is required.”).
Assuming that an individual meets the requirements for establishing an agency’s
failure to maintain a record concerning an individual with “accuracy, relevance,
timeliness, and completeness,” “actual damages” sustained by the individual,
but in no case less than $1000, are recoverable. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4)(A). The
meaning of “actual damages” and the $1000 minimum recovery provision are
discussed below under “Principles Applicable to Damages Lawsuits, Actual
Damages.”
1.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
Most courts have concluded that plaintiffs are not required to exhaust
administrative remedies to obtain damages under (g)(1)(C).
Most courts have concluded that exhaustion of administrative remedies is
not a prerequisite to a civil action for damages under subsection (g)(1)(C).
For example, in Hewitt v. Grabicki, 794 F.2d 1373, 1379 (9th Cir. 1986), the
Ninth Circuit contrasted subsection “(g)(1)(A) (action for order to amend
record permitted when agency review resulted in denial of request or
agency refused to review)” with subsection “(g)(1)(C) (permits action where
agency’s failure to maintain proper records results in adverse determination

against individual)” to conclude that “[e]xhaustion of administrative
remedies is not a precondition to bringing an action for damages under the
Privacy Act.” Phillips v. Widnall, No. 96-2099, 1997 WL 176394, at *2-3 (10th
Cir. Apr. 14, 1997); Hubbard v. EPA, 809 F.2d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 1986), vacated in

(W.D. Mo. Apr. 29, 1992), aff’d, No. 92-3210 (8th Cir. July 9, 1993).
A few other courts have found otherwise, however, requiring plaintiff to
exhaust administrative remedies before bringing an (e)(5) claim under
(g)(1)(C). Moore v. Potter, No. 3:04-CV-1057, 2006 WL 2092277, at *8 (M.D.
Fla. July 26, 2006); see, e.g., Olivares v. NASA, 882 F. Supp. 1545, 1546, 1552
(D. Md. 1995) (concluding that plaintiff’s failure to exhaust administrative
remedies precludes damages claim under subsection (e)(5)), aff’d, 103 F.3d
119 (4th Cir. 1996) (unpublished table decision); Graham v. Hawk, 857 F.
Supp. 38, 40 (W.D. Tenn. 1994) (stating that “[e]ach paragraph of 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g) . . . requires as a prerequisite to any action that the agency refuse
an individual’s request to take some corrective action regarding his file”),
aff’d, 59 F.3d 170 (6th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision).
A provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C.
§ 1997e(a) (2018), requires inmates to exhaust administrative remedies prior
to bringing an “action . . . with respect to prison conditions,” which may
include accuracy of records and requests for correction. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).
However, when the inmate seeks remedies concerning accuracy pursuant to
subsection (e)(5)/(g)(1)(C) and correction of records under (d)(2) in a system
of records that maintains exemptions of (e)(5) and (d)(2), this provision of
the PLRA has minimal practical effect. See Barnett v. United States, 195 F.
Supp. 3d 4, 8 (D.D.C. 2016) (any claims for correction of alleged erroneous
information contained in an inmate’s central file, including presentence
reports, fails because BOP has exempted its Inmate Central Record System
from Privacy Act’s (e)(5) accuracy and (d)(2) amendment requirements
under (j)(2), 28 C.F.R. § 16.97(j)). But cf. McCulough v. BOP, No. 1:06-cv00563, 2011 WL 3568800, at *3-4 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2011) (recommending

brought by prisoners under subsection (g)(1)(D), see the discussion below
under “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C) - Damages Lawsuits for Failure to Comply
with Other Privacy Act Provisions.”
2.

Elements of a Damages Claim
In a suit for damages under subsection (g)(1)(C), an individual has the
burden of proving that: (1) he or she “has been aggrieved by an adverse
determination”; (2) the agency “failed to maintain his or her records with
the degree of accuracy necessary to assure fairness in the determination”; (3)
the agency’s “reliance on the inaccurate records was the proximate cause of
the adverse determination”; and (4) the agency “acted intentionally or
willfully in failing to maintain accurate records.” Deters v. U.S. Parole
Comm’n, 85 F.3d 655, 657 (D.C. Cir. 1996).
In most cases, courts have found that plaintiffs have not met one or more of
these elements and, therefore, were not entitled to damages
First Element: Aggrieved by Adverse Determination
Considering the first requirement for a damages suit under subsection
(g)(1)(C), the courts often have concluded that the plaintiff was not
“aggrieved” or that the agency action at issue did not constitute an
“adverse determination.” See, e.g., Bettersworth v. FDIC, 248 F.3d 386,
392-93 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding that Federal Reserve Bank letter informing
company that its application was unlikely to be approved did not
constitute “adverse determination” against plaintiff because there were
“diverse grounds relied upon in the Reserve Bank’s letter,” entity
applying was company, not plaintiff, and “informal oral or written
statements made in the deliberative process about a particular

Yusim v. SSA, 406 F. Supp. 3d 194, 196 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (finding that SSA’s
allegedly inaccurate listing of claimant’s application date for benefits did
not violate his Privacy Act rights, where he did not claim that failure to
maintain accurate records was done intentionally or willfully or that he
suffered adverse determination); Melvin v. SSA, 126 F. Supp. 3d 584, 606
(E.D.N.C. 2015) (dismissing plaintiff’s (g)(1)(C) claim because there was
“no adverse agency determination resulting from the SSA’s alleged failure
to maintain the September 29, 2010, appeal letter” and no decision had
been made by SSA with regard to plaintiff’s benefits); Scott v. Conley, 937
F. Supp. 2d 60, 78 (D.D.C. 2013) (dismissing plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim

alleged facts to show that she has suffered or is suffering any adverse
determination or effect because of BOP’s alleged failure to comply with
the requirement that it collect only ‘relevant and necessary’ information”);
Elliott v. BOP, 521 F. Supp. 2d 41, 56 (D.D.C. 2007) (“The fact that Plaintiff

do so.”); Lee v. Geren, 480 F. Supp. 2d 198, 209-10 (D.D.C. Mar. 29, 2007)
(concluding that “mere issuance of a notice of proposed termination does
not constitute an ‘adverse determination’ under the Privacy Act” and that
“[t]he only ‘adverse determination’ at issue in this case is plaintiff’s
fourteen-day suspension,” where plaintiff received notice of proposed
termination but was only suspended for two weeks); but see, e.g., Perry v.

Second Element: Failure to Maintain Accurate, Relevant, Timely and/or
Complete Records
Similarly, courts rarely have concluded that an agency failed to maintain
accurate records. See, e.g., Jones v. Luis, 372 F. App’x 967, 969-70 (11th
Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (ruling that district court properly dismissed
Privacy Act claim where plaintiff “does not allege any errors in the BOP’s
record keeping” but rather merely “alleges that [a BOP official] misused
the information in the records to make an adverse determination against”
plaintiff); Treadwell v. BOP, 32 F. App’x 519, 520-21 (10th Cir. 2002)
(finding plaintiff’s claim that BOP erroneously based his security
classification in part on nonviolent juvenile robbery offense does not
amount to violation of Privacy Act where plaintiff agreed that conviction
accurately appeared on his record but disagreed with way BOP used that
information); Williams v. BOP, No. 94-5098, 1994 WL 676801, at *1 (D.C.
Cir. Oct. 21, 1994) (asserting appellant did not establish either that agency
“maintained an inaccurate record or that it made a determination adverse
to him in reliance on inaccurate information capable of verification, the
statutory prerequisites to maintaining an action pursuant to the Privacy
Act”); Hadley v. Moon, No. 94-1212, 1994 WL 582907, at *1-2 (10th Cir.

interpretation of legal issues rather than factual errors); Hollins v. Cross,

Doe v. DOJ, 660 F. Supp. 2d 31, 43 (D.D.C. 2009) (concluding that plaintiff
“failed to show that there was an error in the records” by objecting only to
“misinterpretation of [accurate] records by DOJ employees, for which
there is no remedy under the Privacy Act”); De la Cruz-Jimenez v. DOJ,
566 F. Supp. 2d 7, 9-10 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding that plaintiff failed to
establish the threshold requirement of an inaccurate record, thus
dismissing plaintiff’s (g)(1)(C) claim); but see, e.g., Perry, 371 F.3d at 1305
(finding plaintiffs had alleged necessary elements to state claim, vacating
district’s court decision and remanding for district court to consider
complaint under Privacy Act); Fleck v. VA OIG, 2020 WL 42842, at *6-8
(denying VA’s motion to dismiss where second agency’s decision not to
hire plaintiff was adverse action, plaintiff sufficiently alleged factual
inaccuracies in OIG report, and inaccuracies led to second agency’s failure
to hire him); Ashbourne v. Hansberry, 302 F. Supp. 3d 338, 347 (D.D.C.
2018) (finding that plaintiff properly pled in her complaint that defendant
DHS failed to maintain accurate records when it intentionally and
deliberatively failed to verify facts in deciding to terminate plaintiff’s
federal employment).
Most cases brought under (g)(1)(C) involve the “accuracy” standard, but the
D.C. District Court allowed a case to proceed under the “relevance” component.
Although most litigation pursuant to sections (e)(5)/(g)(1)(C) of the
Privacy Act arises from challenges to the accuracy component of the
“accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness” standard, the District
Court for the District of Columbia has considered a claim alleging
irrelevancy. In Gerlich v. DOJ, the court noted that “[m]ost ‘adverse
determination’ claims hinge on inaccurate or incomplete records.” 659 F.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Supp. 2d 1, 15 (D.D.C. 2009), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 711 F.3d 161, 163
(D.C. Cir. 2013). Here, however, the plaintiffs alleged that “irrelevant
records (i.e., the records of their First Amendment activities) led to an
adverse [hiring] determination against them.” Id. In denying the
Department’s motion to dismiss, the court stated: “By the plain language
of (g)(1)(C), relevance stands on equal footing with accuracy, timeliness
and completeness as a basis for pursuing money damages for an adverse
determination.” Id. at 15-16 (holding that summary judgment was
inappropriately granted under subsections (e)(5) and (e)(7) claims and
concluding “in light of the destruction of appellants’ records, that a
permissive spoliation inference was warranted because the senior
Department officials had a duty to preserve the annotated applications
and internet printouts given that Department investigation and future
litigation were reasonably foreseeable”). For a more complete discussion
of Gerlich, see the discussion under “5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(5) - Maintain
Accurate, Relevant, Timely, and Complete Records” above.
Third element: Proximate Cause
Courts commonly have dismissed an individual’s (g)(1)(c) suit if that
individual did not meet the third requirement for such claims, i.e., that the
agency’s reliance on inaccurate records was the proximate cause of the
adverse determination. See, e.g., Chambers v. Interior, 568 F.3d 998, 1007
(D.C. Cir. 2009) (dismissing plaintiff’s (g)(1)(C) claim because plaintiff
failed to show specific adverse determination resulting from agency’s
failure to maintain accurate records); Hutchinson v. CIA, 393 F.3d 226,
229-30 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (concluding that plaintiff failed to show that
alleged inaccuracies proximately caused adverse determination because
record demonstrates that she was dismissed for sustained poor
performance spanning three years); Rogers v. BOP, 105 F. App’x 980, 98384 (10th Cir. 2004) (plaintiff failed to state Privacy Act claim under
(g)(1)(C) because he failed to show that inaccurate record caused his
eligibility for parole, rather than his legal ineligibility); Gowan v. Air
Force, 148 F.3d 1182, 1194 (10th Cir. 1998) (finding no adverse effect from
Air Force’s informing Wyoming Bar of court-martial charges preferred
against plaintiff where plaintiff himself later informed Wyoming Bar
without knowing Air Force had already done so); Williams v. BOP, No.
94-5098, 1994 WL 676801, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 21, 1994) (asserting
appellant did not establish either that agency “maintained an inaccurate
record or that it made a determination adverse to him in reliance on
inaccurate information capable of verification, the statutory prerequisites
to maintaining an action pursuant to the Privacy Act”); Colley v. James,

254 F. Supp. 3d 45, 67 (D.D.C. 2017) (finding that plaintiffs did not

pertaining to their appeal and there was no indication that incorrect
information had been relied upon as part of appeal); Gillman v. United
States, No. 16-00001, 2017 WL 969180, at *4-5 (D. Hawaii March 13, 2017)
(finding that plaintiff “failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue

willfully in maintaining allegedly inaccurate medical records,” and failed
to provide “evidence to show that the VA’s maintenance of allegedly
inaccurate mental health records caused a required adverse determination
or actual damages”); Ashbourne, 2015 WL 11303198, at *7-9 (finding that
plaintiff failed to allege claim under subsection (g)(1)(C) where plaintiff
did not present evidence of inaccurate record relied upon by agency
when reviewing misleading information provided by plaintiff during preemployment process); Doe v. Rogers, 139 F. Supp. 3d at 168 (dismissing
plaintiff’s (g)(1)(C) claim because “only agency ‘decision’ that arguably

any inaccurate agency report that the Secretary relied on to reach that

(notwithstanding that plaintiff’s claim (g)(1)(C) claim fails because alert
FBI issued in response to statements made by plaintiff to agency
personnel was exempt from Privacy Act’s maintenance requirements,
dismissing claim because even if court accepted plaintiff’s security
clearance suspension or mandatory fitness examination as adverse
determinations, plaintiff failed to show alert was cause of adverse
determinations); Singh v. DHS, No. 1:12-cv-00498, 2014 WL 67254, at *9-11
(E.D. Cal. Jan. 8, 2014) (dismissing plaintiff’s (g)(1)(C) and (g)(1)(D) claims

that it collect only ‘relevant and necessary’ information”); New-Howard v.

or willful conduct”), aff’d sub nom. Kellett v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 66
F.3d 306 (1st Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision); but see, e.g., Perry,

claim, vacating district’s court decision and remanding for district court to
consider complaint under Privacy Act); Fleck v. VA OIG, 2020 WL 42842,
at *6-8 (denying VA’s motion to dismiss where second agency’s decision
not to hire plaintiff was adverse action, plaintiff sufficiently alleged
factual inaccuracies in OIG report, and inaccuracies led to second agency’s

(N.D. Ill. 2014) (“[Plaintiff] has linked the alleged Privacy Act violation

against him because of its reliance on DHS’s inaccurate records, the
detainer disqualified [plaintiff] from boot camp, [plaintiff] was not
processed into boot camp until his father retained an attorney’s assistance
to prompt ICE to cancel the detainer, and the delay in processing into boot
camp caused [plaintiff] to remain incarcerated from May to July 2011,
preventing him from seeking employment.”).
Fourth Element: Intentional or Willful Conduct
Finally, plaintiffs rarely have established that an agency intentionally or
willfully failed to maintain accurate records. See, e.g., Deters v. Parole
Comm’n, 85 F.3d 655, 660 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (concluding that where Parole
Commission informed plaintiff that it would consider his challenge and
examine the accuracy of his records at parole hearing, no fact-finder could
determine that agency “flagrantly disregarded” plaintiff’s Privacy Act
rights and that “a violation (if any) could in no sense be deemed ‘patently
egregious and unlawful.’”); Yusim, 406 F. Supp. 3d at 196 (finding that
SSA’s allegedly inaccurate listing of claimant’s application date for
benefits did not violate his Privacy Act rights, where he did not claim that
failure to maintain accurate records was done intentionally or willfully or
that he suffered adverse determination); Colley v. James, 254 F. Supp. 3d
45, 67 (D.D.C. 2017) (finding that plaintiffs did not establish that the Air

appeal and there was no indication that incorrect information had been
relied upon as part of appeal); Ahuruonye v. Interior, 239 F. Supp. 3d 136,

or willful conduct”); but see Ashbourne v. Hansberry, 302 F. Supp. 3d at
347 (finding that plaintiff properly pled in her complaint that defendant
DHS failed to maintain accurate records when it intentionally and
deliberatively failed to verify facts in deciding to terminate plaintiff’s
federal employment). For additional discussion of the “intentional or
willful” standard under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4) for damages actions, see
discussion below under “Principles Applicable to Damages Lawsuits,
Intentional or Willful Standard.”

Standard and Scope of Review
Courts review (g)(1)(C) lawsuits under the standards set out in that section, not de
novo.
Unlike amendment lawsuits under subsection (g)(1)(A), courts do not
review subsection (g)(1)(C) actions under a de novo standard. Compare 5
U.S.C. § 552a(g)(2) with id. § 552a(g)(4). Instead, the courts determine
whether the standards for “accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and
completeness” set forth in subsection (g)(1)(C) have been met. See White v.
OPM, 787 F.2d 660, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“In § 552a(g)(1)(C) . . . suits for
damages, however, de novo review is not called for. Rather, the reviewing
court is to inquire whether the standard articulated in § 552a(g)(1)(C) has
been met.”); see also Sellers v. BOP, 959 F.2d 307, 312-13 (D.C. Cir. 1992);
Nolan v. DOJ, No. 89-A-2035, 1991 WL 134803, at *3 (D. Colo. July 17, 1991),
appeal dismissed in pertinent part on procedural grounds, 973 F.2d 843

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Plaintiffs cannot use subsection (g)(1)(C) lawsuits to collaterally attack agency
determinations.
Just as in the amendment context (see “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A) Amendment Lawsuits” discussion above), many courts have expressed
disfavor toward litigants who attempt to invoke the subsection (g)(1)(C)
damages remedy as a basis for collateral attacks on judicial and quasijudicial agency determinations, such as those denying benefit and or
detrimental employment decisions. See, e.g., Taylor v. Def. Fin. &
Accounting Servs., No. 2:12-2466, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 268, at *25 (E.D. Cal.
Jan. 3, 2014) (finding that plaintiff cannot use claim under (g)(1)(C) and

Middlebrooks v. Mabus, No. 1:11cv46, 2011 WL 4478686, at *5 (E.D. Va.
Sept. 23, 2011) (“Even if these claims were not untimely, . . . plaintiff’s
challenge to the accuracy of her record is a veiled attempt to relitigate her

facts are erroneously recorded but not for altering records that reflect an
administrative decision or assessments.”); Feldman, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 47

correct a factual or historical error in an official record that proximately
caused an adverse determination”); Doe v. DOJ, 660 F. Supp. 2d at 42-43
(“[P]laintiff’s arguments that defendants lacked a basis to terminate him

Similarly, subsection (g)(1)(C) lawsuits filed to attack a criminal conviction or
sentence are not cognizable.
Federal prisoners frequently attempt to invoke the subsection (g)(1)(C)
damages remedy as a basis for a collateral attack on a conviction or the
duration of a sentence. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has
explained that “such a claim is not cognizable” unless the conviction or
sentence “has been invalidated in a prior proceeding.” White v. Prob.
Office, 148 F.3d 1124, 1125-26 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam). In White, the
D.C. Circuit held that a Privacy Act claim for damages could not be brought
to “collaterally to attack” a federal prisoner’s sentence, stating that:
“Because a judgment in favor of [plaintiff] on his challenge to the legal
conclusions in his presentence report would necessarily imply the invalidity
of his sentence, which has not been invalidated in a prior proceeding, his
complaint for damages under the Privacy Act must be dismissed.” Id. at
1125-26. See also, e.g., Aguiar v. DEA, 334 F. Supp. 3d 130, 146 (D.D.C. 2018)

using “false information” to assign prisoner less favorable custody and
security classifications “is nothing more than an attempt to resurrect an
otherwise improper [petition for writ of habeas corpus]”).
Courts often have found Privacy Act damages claims under subsection (g)(1)(C)
precluded by other statutes.
As in the amendment context, 26 U.S.C. § 7852(e) (2018) (a provision of the
Internal Revenue Code) also displaces the Privacy Act’s damages remedy
for inaccurate records in matters concerning tax liability. See, e.g., Risk v.
United States, No. 07-60025, 2007 WL 9701106, at * 2 (finding that “plaintiffs’
reliance on the Privacy Act of 1974 is also misplaced since the Internal
Revenue Code explicitly states that [(g)(1)(C)] is inapplicable in tax matters”
(citing to 26 U.S.C. § 7852(e)); see also Ford v. United States, No. 91-36319,
1992 WL 387154, at *2 (9th Cir. Dec. 24, 1992); McMillen v. Treasury, 960

In Hubbard v. EPA, the leading D.C. Circuit case concerning the causation
requirement of subsection (g)(1)(C), the D.C. Circuit’s finding of a lack of
causation was heavily influenced by the Civil Service Reform Act’s (CSRA)

jurisdictional bar to district court review of government personnel practices.
See 809 F.2d at 5. Although the D.C. Circuit stopped short of holding that
the CSRA’s comprehensive remedial scheme constitutes a jurisdictional bar
to a subsection (g)(1)(C) action, it noted that “it would be anomalous to
construe the pre-existing Privacy Act to grant the district court power to do
indirectly that which Congress precluded directly: ‘the Privacy Act was not
intended to shield [federal] employees from the vicissitudes of federal
personnel management decisions.’” Id. (quoting Albright v. United States,
732 F.2d 181, 190 (D.C. Cir. 1984)); cf. Biondo v. Navy, No. 2:92-0184-18, slip
op. at 21-23 (D.S.C. June 29, 1993) (finding, based upon Hubbard, “that the
‘collateral attack’ argument complements the causation requirement of the
Privacy Act”). The concurring opinion in Hubbard argued, however, that
“[n]othing in the wording or legislative history of either Act” supports the
majority’s “suggestion that serious consideration of a Privacy Act claim in
the context of a federal personnel dispute somehow creates a potential
conflict with the” (CSRA). 809 F.2d at 12-13 (Wald, J., concurring) (citing
Molerio v. FBI, 749 F.2d 815, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1984), Albright, 732 F.2d at 188,
and Borrell v. U.S. Int’l Commc’n Agency, 682 F.2d 981, 992-93 (D.C. Cir.
1982)). That opinion also noted that circuit court precedents since the
passage of the CSRA have, “without a hint of the majority’s caution,
reviewed the Privacy Act claims of federal employees or applicants
embroiled in personnel disputes.” Id.
Although Hubbard merely applied a strict causation test where a
government personnel determination was being challenged, several more
cases have gone further and construed the CSRA’s comprehensive remedial
scheme to constitute a jurisdictional bar to subsection (g)(1)(C) damages
lawsuits challenging federal employment determinations. See Yu v. VA, 528
F. App’x 181, 184 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming district court decision that VA’s
actions that took place after plaintiff’s termination “are personnel decisions
because they ‘occurred only as result of the employment relationship’
[plaintiff] had with the VA,” and therefore, preclude Privacy Act damages
claims); Doe v. FDIC, 545 F. App’x 6, 8 (2d Cir. 2013) (stating that because
“Doe’s Privacy Act claims fall within the definition of a ‘prohibited
personnel action,’ the CSRA dictates that Doe may not pursue her claims in
federal court”); Orsay v. DOJ, 289 F.3d 1125, 1128-31 (9th Cir. 2002); Phillips

individual as a result of an adverse determination based upon such

To date, the D.C. Circuit has declined to rule that the CSRA bars a Privacy
Act claim for damages. See Kleiman v. Energy, 956 F.2d 335, 337-39 & n.5
(D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that Privacy Act did not afford relief where
plaintiff did not contest that record accurately reflected his assigned job title,

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered the interplay between
the Privacy Act and a statute that broadly precludes judicial review of VA
disability benefit decisions – 38 U.S.C. § 211(a) (later repealed, now see 38
U.S.C. § 511 (2018)) – and concluded that it barred a subsection (g)(1)(C)
damages action. Rosen v. Walters, 719 F.2d 1422, 1424-25 (9th Cir. 1983). In
Rosen, the plaintiff contended that the VA deliberately destroyed medical
records pertinent to his disability claim, thereby preventing him from
presenting all the evidence in his favor. Id. at 1424. The Ninth Circuit ruled
that such a damages claim would “necessarily run counter to the purposes
of § 211(a)” because it would require a determination as to whether “but for
the missing records, Rosen should have been awarded disability benefits.”
Id. at 1425. Further, it declined to find that the Privacy Act “repealed by
implication” 38 U.S.C. § 211(a). Id.; see also Demoruelle v. VA, No. 1600562, 2017 WL 2836989, at *5 (D. Hawaii June 30, 2017) (dismissing

(D.D.C. 1982) (“The Privacy Act was not intended to be and should not be
allowed to become a ‘backdoor mechanism’ to subvert the finality of agency
determinations.” (quoting Lyon v. United States, 94 F.R.D. 69, 72 (W.D.
Okla. 1982))). Relying on Rosen, the District Court for the District of Idaho
similarly held that the statutory scheme regarding the awarding of
retirement benefits and “Congress’s intent that OPM, MSPB and the Federal
Circuit review decisions regarding the denial of disability retirement
benefits” prohibited it from reviewing Privacy Act damages claim where
plaintiff alleged that VA’s failure to maintain file resulted in his being
denied disability retirement benefits by OPM. Braun v. Brown, No. CV 970063-S, slip op. at 7-11 (D. Idaho June 22, 1998).
Several courts have held that the provision of the Federal Employees’
Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. § 8116(c) (2018), that provides that the
liability of the United States under FECA with respect to the injury of an
employee is exclusive, operates to preclude a cause of action under the

2001), aff’d per curiam, No. 01-1491 (4th Cir. July 3, 2001). The court ruled

of competent medical evidence” and establishing that agency’s disclosure of
records caused her alleged emotional injury, “that is immaterial to the issue
of the Court’s jurisdiction”); Lyon v. United States, 94 F.R.D. 69, 72 (W.D.
Okla. 1982) (finding Privacy Act claim cannot be “a backdoor mechanism to
subvert authority bestowed upon the Secretary of Labor to handle employee
compensation claims”; stating FECA “provides the exclusive method of
presenting compensation claims resulting from on-the-job injuries of federal
employees”); cf. Jackson v. Labor, No. 2:06-CV-02157, 2008 WL 539925, at *4

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The D.C. District Court has found that a Privacy Act claim is not precluded by the
exclusivity of relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
The District Court for the District of Columbia concluded, however that a
Privacy Act claim was not precluded by the exclusivity of relief under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (2018). See Velikonja v.
Mueller, 315 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that agency “failed to
cite any cases in which a Privacy Act claim is precluded by Title VII” and
that “the court is not aware of any”), subsequent opinion, 362 F. Supp. 2d 1,
13-19 (D.D.C. 2004) (finding no inaccuracies, adverse determination, or
intentional or willful conduct), aff’d in part & rev’d in part sub nom.
Velikonja v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d 122 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (affirming on ground of
finding of no inaccuracies, adverse determination, or intentional or willful
conduct).
The courts have split as to whether the (g)(1)(C) standards apply only to the
receiving agency or to any agency.
In Perry v. FBI, 759 F.2d 1271, 1275-76 (7th Cir. 1985), reh’g en banc granted
on other grounds, 769 F.2d 450 (7th Cir. 1985), the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit, without discussing subsection (g)(1)(C), adopted a
comparatively narrower construction of subsection (e)(5), holding that
“when one federal agency sends records to another agency to be used by the
latter in making a decision about someone, the responsibility for ensuring
that the information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete lies with the
receiving agency – the agency making ‘the determination’ about the person
in question – not the sending agency.”
Subsequently, however, in Dickson v. OPM, 828 F.2d 32, 36-40 (D.C. Cir.
1987), the D.C. Circuit held that a subsection (g)(1)(C) damages lawsuit is
proper against any agency maintaining a record violating the standard of
fairness mandated by the Act, regardless of whether that agency is the one
making the adverse determination. See also Blazy v. Tenet, 979 F. Supp. 10,
19 (D.D.C. 1997) (“The adverse determination need not be made by the
agency that actually maintains the record so long as it flowed from the
inaccurate record.” (citing Dickson)), summary affirmance granted, No. 975330, 1998 WL 315583 (D.C. Cir. May 12, 1998); Doe v. U.S. Civil Serv.
Comm’n, 483 F. Supp. 539, 556 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (applying subsection (e)(5) to
agency whose records were used by another agency in making
determination about individual); R.R. v. Army, 482 F. Supp. at 773 (applying
subsection (e)(5) to agency whose records were used by another agency in
making determination about individual). In so holding, the D.C. Circuit
[252]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

noted that “the structure of the Act makes it abundantly clear that
[sub]section (g) civil remedy actions operate independently of the
obligations imposed on agency recordkeeping pursuant to [sub]section
(e)(5).” Dickson, 828 F.2d at 38. In Dickson, the D.C. Circuit distinguished
Perry on the grounds that “[a]ppellant is not proceeding under [sub]section
(e)(5), Perry does not discuss [sub]section (g)(1)(C), and the construction of
(e)(5) does not migrate by logic or statutory mandate to a separate
[sub]section on civil remedies.” 828 F.2d at 38; see also Doe v. FBI, 718 F.
Supp. at 95 n.15 (noting conflict in cases but finding that Dickson’s holding
obviated need “to enter that thicket”).
D. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(D) - Damages Lawsuits for Failure to Comply with Other
Privacy Act Provisions
“Whenever any agency . . . fails to comply with any other provision of this
section, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an
adverse effect on an individual . . . the individual may bring a civil action.”
5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(D).
Comment:
In addition to damages under subsection (g)(1)(C)’s “accuracy, relevance,
timeliness, and completeness” standard, subsection (g)(1)(D) provides a “catchall” remedies provisions that allows lawsuits for actual damages against an
agency for failure to comply with “any other provision” of the Privacy Act, if
there is an “adverse effect” on the individual.
1.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedy
Individuals are not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit
under subsection (g)(1)(D).
Exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to a civil action
for damages under subsection (g)(1)(D). Diederich v. Army, 878 F.2d 646,
648 (2d Cir. 1989); Nagel v. HEW, 725 F.2d 1438, 1441 & n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1984);
McKoy v. Spencer, No. 16-1313, 2019 WL 400615, at *4 -5 (D.D.C. Jan. 31,
2019) (finding that while claim to amend record does require exhaustion of
administrative remedies, damages claim stemming from improper
disclosure of personnel records to third parties does not); Gergick v. Austin,
No. 89-0838-CV-W-2, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7338, at *13-16 (W.D. Mo. Apr.
29, 1992), aff’d, No. 92-3210 (8th Cir. July 9, 1993); Pope v. Bond, 641 F. Supp.
489, 500 (D.D.C. 1986). But see Graham v. Hawk, 857 F. Supp. 38, 40 (W.D.

Tenn. 1994) (stating that “[e]ach paragraph of 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g) . . . requires
as a prerequisite to any action that the agency refuse an individual’s request
to take some corrective action regarding his file”), aff’d, 59 F.3d 170 (6th Cir.
1995) (unpublished table decision).
The Prison Litigation Reform Act imposes additional procedural requirements on
prisoners, however.
While “exhaustion is normally not required for damages actions under the
Privacy Act,” note that 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2018), a provision of the Prison
Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (“PLRA”), “imposes additional procedural
requirements with respect to prisoners.” Reid v. BOP, No. 04-1845, 2005 WL
1699425, at *3 (D.D.C. July 20, 2005). Specifically, § 1997e(a) provides that
“[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [any
Federal law] by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional
facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.”
42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The Supreme Court “has read the exhaustion
requirements [of § 1997e(a)] broadly to include ‘all inmate suits about prison
life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and
whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.’” Reid, 2005 WL
1699425, at *3 (quoting Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002)). In McGee
v. BOP, for example, the prisoner sued the BOP alleging unlawful
disclosure. 118 F. App’x 471, 474 (10th Cir. 2004). The Court of Appeals for
the Tenth Circuit concluded that the prisoner “failed to exhaust his
administrative remedies with respect to his Privacy Act claim” pursuant to
§ 1997e(a). Id. at 475; see also Smith v. B A Blackmon Warden FCI
Marianna, No. 5:18CV40, 2019 WL 3047081, at *6-7 (N.D. Fla. May 21, 2019)
(magistrate recommendation) (finding prisoner’s claim under Privacy Act
“must be a separate (non-habeas) filing subject to the PLRA, filing fee and
other provisions”) adopted, 2019 WL 3037921 (N.D. Fla. 2019); LugoVazquez v. Grondolsky, No. 08-986, 2010 WL 2287556, at *2-3 (D.N.J. June 2,
2010) (granting summary judgment to agency on Privacy Act claim because
plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies under § 1997e(a)); cf. Lee
v. DOJ, 235 F.R.D. 274, 289-91 (W.D. Pa. 2006) (concluding that PLRA did
not apply to allegation that “pertain[ed] to the disclosure of the [record] to a
private bank, not to the means by which it was obtained,” because allegation
“did not relate to prison life”).
2.

Elements of a Subsection (g)(1)(D) Claim
In a suit for damages under subsection (g)(1)(D), an individual has the
burden of proving that: (1) the information at issue is covered by the Privacy
[254]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Act’s provisions; (2) the agency violated a provision of the Privacy Act not
covered by the other civil remedies provisions; (3) the violation had an
“adverse effect” on the plaintiff that was a “causal nexus” between the
violation and the adverse effect; and (4) the violation was “willful or
intentional.” See, e.g., Quinn v. Stone, 978 F.2d 126, 131 (3d Cir. 1992);
Pierce v. Air Force, 512 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir. 2007). The third element of
this cause of action, which is composed of two parts – “adverse effects” and
“causation” – is discussed in detail, below. As referenced below, analysis of
the remaining elements can be found in other sections of this Overview.
First Element: Information Covered by Privacy Act
Information is generally covered by the Privacy Act if it is a “record”
maintained in a “system of records.” See Quinn, 978 F.2d at 132
(concluding that information disclosed -- hunting roster and time card -was information covered by Privacy Act because it “contained an
identifying particular (the plaintiff's name) and was maintained within a
system of records”). Certain records, however, may be subject to the
Privacy Act’s provisions, even if not maintained in a system of records.
See, e.g., McCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2006). These issues
are discussed in more detail above under the “Definitions” section.
Second Element: Catch-All Remedy Provision
Subsection (g)(1)(D) acts as a “catch-all remedy provision applicable if the
agency ‘fails to comply with any other provision’ of the Privacy Act.”
E.g., Fazaga v. FBI, 965 F.3d 1015, 1063 (9th Cir. 2020) (claim based on an
alleged violation of subsection (e)(7)); Sussman v. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d
1106 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (claimed based on an alleged violation of subsection
(b)). Plaintiffs must demonstrate that an agency’s action violated a Privacy
Act provision not otherwise captured in subsections (g)(1)(A), (g)(1)(B), or
(g)(1)(C) in order to successfully raise a claim under subsection (g)(1)(D).
Third Element: Adverse Effect had Causal Nexus to Violation
Adverse Effects
A complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a subsection
(g)(1)(D) damages claim if no “adverse effect” is alleged. See, e.g., Doe
v. Chao, 540 U.S. 614, 624 (2004) (“‘[A]dverse effect’ acts as a term of art
identifying a potential plaintiff who satisfies the injury-in-fact and
causation requirements of Article III standing, and who may

consequently bring a civil action without suffering dismissal for want of
standing to sue.”); Hunt v. VA, 739 F.3d 706, 707 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“The
district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellant’s Privacy
Act claims for damages because the claims are based on the assertion
‘that the VA’s failure to maintain accurate and complete records
adversely affected a veteran’s benefits determinations.’”); Hernandez v.
Johnson, 514 F. App’x 492, 500 (5th Cir. 2013) (holding that “although
[appellant] complained of damages dating back to 2008, he also
indicated in his deposition that he was not aware of any of the
disclosures until either 2010 or 2011,” and thus, “no reasonable jury
could find that the adverse effects [appellant] suffered were caused by
these disclosures”); Shearson v. DHS, 638 F.3d 498, 505-06 (6th Cir.
2011) (“[Plaintiff’s] request to pursue a claim under § 552a(e)(4) was
properly denied because she failed to allege or show the requisite
‘adverse effect’ from Defendants’ alleged failure to provide notice
specifically regarding the [system of records] at an earlier date.”);
McCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (remanding case for
district court to determine whether plaintiff suffered “adverse effect” by
being denied bonus); Quinn, 978 F.2d at 135 (“[T]he adverse effect
requirement of (g)(1)(D) is, in effect, a standing requirement.”); Taylor
v. FAA, 351 F. Supp. 3d 97, 103-4 (D.D.C. 2018) (finding no adverse
effect from mere improper maintenance of Plaintiff’s name, address,
and email address by the FAA); Wright v. United States, No. 4:17-CV02101, 2018 WL 4854037, at *8 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 5, 2018) (dismissing
Privacy Act claim as not satisfying standing requirements where no
particularized injury regarding plaintiff’s own data being lost was
alleged); Young v. Tryon, No. 12-CV-6251CJS, 2015 WL 309431, at *17
(W.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2015) (magistrate recommendation) (noting lack of
actual damages where complaint only alleged disclosure of medical
information caused plaintiff to be “very uncomfortable discussing his
medical issues”) adopted, 2015 WL 554807 (Feb. 11, 2015); Dick v.
Holder, 67 F. Supp. 3d 167, 182-3 (D.D.C. 2014 (finding agent failed to
provide allegations plausibly suggesting causal link between disclosure
warning and claimed adverse effects); Fletcher v. DOJ, 17 F. Supp. 3d
89, 95-96 (D.D.C. 2014) (stating in dicta that “[b]ecause the requested
court documents might be available from the [court] where they
originated [ ] plaintiff cannot show an adverse effect from the agency’s
destruction of the copies of the same records”); Reed v. Navy, 910 F.
Supp. 2d 32, 45 (D.D.C. 2012) (finding that disclosures did not cause
plaintiff to be constructively discharged because “the causal link
between the disclosures and plaintiff’s separation from [his employer]
is broken by intervening events”); Mata v. McHugh, No. 10-cv-838, 2012

“Adverse effects” include nonpecuniary and nonphysical harm as well as
monetary loss.
An “adverse effect” includes not only monetary damages, but also
nonpecuniary and nonphysical harm, such as mental distress,

For a novel interpretation of “adverse effect,” see Bagwell v. Brannon,
No. 82-8711, slip op. at 5-6 (11th Cir. Feb. 22, 1984), in which the Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found that no “adverse effect” was
caused by the government’s disclosure of an employee’s personnel file
during cross-examination while defending against the employee’s tort
lawsuit, because the “employee created the risk that pertinent but
embarrassing aspects of his work record would be publicized” and
“disclosure was consistent with the purpose for which the information
was originally collected.”

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

“Adverse effect” is a separate element from “actual damages.”
The threshold showing of “adverse effect,” which typically is not
difficult for a plaintiff to satisfy, should carefully be distinguished from
the conceptually separate requirement of “actual damages,” discussed
below. See, e.g., Fort Hall Landowners Alliance, Inc. v. BIA, 407 F.
Supp. 2d 1220, 1225 (D. Idaho 2006) (explaining that “[i]t is important
not to confuse this standing requirement with the entirely separate
element that requires proof of actual damages” and that “to satisfy the
Privacy Act’s adverse effect and causation requirements, plaintiffs need
not show actual damages from the disclosure, but must merely satisfy
the traditional ‘injury-in-fact and causation requirements of Article
III’”). As one district court has explained, “[t]he requirement of an
‘adverse effect’ requires more” than a “statement of ‘damages’ [that]
merely summarizes the alleged violations of law.” Foncello v. Army,
No. 04-604, 2005 WL 2994011, at *4 (D. Conn. Nov. 7, 2005).
The distinct nature of these two elements is demonstrated by the
Supreme Court’s review in FAA v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1441 (2012), of an
opinion by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Cooper v. FAA,
622 F.3d 1016 (9th Cir. 2010). In Cooper, the Ninth Circuit, in
construing the Privacy Act to allow for the recovery of nonpecuniary
damages, reasoned that because “mental distress or emotional harm is
sufficient to constitute an adverse effect,” a construction of the Act that
allowed a plaintiff to establish standing for an injury that results in
nonpecuniary harm, but that would not allow the plaintiff to seek
actual damages for such a nonpecuniary injury would “frustrate the
intent of Congress.” Id. at 1021. The Ninth Circuit majority further
stated that “[i]n contrast, our opinion is true to the overall objective of
the Act, allowing a plaintiff who demonstrates a nonpecuniary adverse
effect to have the opportunity to recover nonpecuniary damages.” Id.
However, on writ of certiorari a majority of the Supreme Court reversed
the Ninth Circuit’s opinion and held that the Privacy Act does not
authorize damages for nonpecuniary injuries such as mental or
emotional distress. The Supreme Court did not consider the separate
issue of “adverse effect” in its ruling. See FAA v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. at
1453; see also, Fazaga v. FBI, 916 F.3d 1202, 1249 (9th Cir. 2019) (finding
only damages and not injunctive relief available for Privacy Act
violations of the catch-all provision at § 552a(g)(1)(D)); Coleman v. U.S.,
912 F.3d 824, 836 (5th Cir. 2019) (affirming summary judgement on
Privacy Act claim against plaintiff who did not offer any evidence of
actual harm other than her own unsubstantiated allegations of

288 F. Supp. 3d 231, 236-37 (D.D.C. 2018) (finding claim that plaintiff
suffered “adverse and harmful effects” insufficient where effects
included “mental distress, emotional trauma, embarrassment,
humiliation” that are not authorized under Privacy Act and where
alleged “lost or jeopardized present and future financial opportunities”
were not supported by sufficient facts to sustain claim of actual
damages).
Causation
A showing of causation – that the violation caused an adverse effect,
and that the violation caused “actual damages,” as discussed below – is
also required. See, e.g., Beaven v. DOJ, 622 F. 3d 540, 558 (6th Cir. 2010);

injury and the violation of the Act, the injury necessarily must be
distinct and independent from the violation of the Act itself.” Schmidt

v. VA, 218 F.R.D. at 632; see also Doe v. Chao, 306 F.3d at 186 (Michaels,
J., dissenting) (“The causal prong makes it especially clear that an
adverse effect must be something distinct from the intentional and
willful violation itself. For if a violation of the Privacy Act was
sufficient to constitute an adverse effect, there could be no question of
whether the violation caused the adverse effect, and hence the causal
prong would be superfluous.”); Quinn, 978 F.2d at 135 (stating that in
addition to establishing an adverse effect sufficient to confer standing,
“plaintiff must also allege a causal connection between the agency
violation and the adverse effect”); cf. Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. 614, 627
(2004) (“The ‘entitle[ment] to recovery’ necessary to qualify for the
$1,000 minimum is not shown merely by an intentional or willful
violation of the Act producing some adverse effect.”). But cf. RomeroVargas v. Shalala, 907 F. Supp. 1128, 1134-35 (N.D. Ohio 1995) (stating,
prior to Supreme Court’s decision in Doe v. Chao, that “emotional
distress caused by the fact that the plaintiff’s privacy has been violated
is itself an adverse effect, and that statutory damages can be awarded
without an independent showing of adverse effects”; stating further in
memorandum on motion to alter or amend judgment that “[i]t is
eminently reasonable to infer that plaintiffs suffered mental distress by
the fact of knowing their personal information had been disclosed”).
Fourth Element: Intentional or Willful Standard
In addition, an agency must be found to have acted in an “intentional or
willful” manner in order for a damages action to succeed. See 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(4). This standard is discussed below under “Civil Remedies,
Principles Applicable to Damages Lawsuits, Intentional or Willful
Standard.”
3.

Standard and Scope of Review
Certain statutes preempt the Privacy Act’s remedies for alleged violations of the
Privacy Act’s disclosure provisions.
The issue of the Privacy Act’s applicability to disclosures of tax information
has been analyzed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit in Gardner v. United States, 213 F.3d 735 (D.C. Cir. 2000), aff’d, No.
96-1467, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2195, at *14-17 (D.D.C. Jan. 29, 1999). In
Gardner, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the Internal Revenue Code
preempts the Privacy Act for remedies for disclosures of tax information,
holding that 26 U.S.C. § 6103 is “the exclusive remedy for a taxpayer
[262]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

claiming unlawful disclosure of his or her tax returns and tax information.”
213 F.3d at 741-42. Similarly, although not going quite as far, the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had previously held that “[26 U.S.C.] § 6103 is a
more detailed statute that should preempt the more general remedies of the
Privacy Act, at least where . . . those remedies are in conflict.” Hobbs v.
United States, 209 F.3d 408, 412 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding § 6103 and the
Privacy Act to be “in conflict” where disclosure fell within one of the
exceptions in § 6103, and holding that “[t]o the extent that the Privacy Act
would recognize a cause of action for unauthorized disclosure of tax return
information even where § 6103 would provide an exception for the
particular disclosure, § 6103 trumps the Privacy Act”). Other courts, too,
have found the provisions of the tax code to be exclusive as to wrongful
disclosures of tax information. See Ross v. United States, 460 F. Supp. 2d
139, 151 (D.D.C. 2006) (“[Section] 6103 is the exclusive remedy for a taxpayer
claiming unlawful disclosure of his or her tax returns and information.”);
Schwartz v. Kempf, No. 4:02-cv-198, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2238, at *10-12
(W.D. Mich. Jan. 22, 2004) (citing Gardner and finding the provisions of the
Privacy Act to be “trumped by the more specific provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code found in 26 U.S.C. § 6103”); Berridge v. Heiser, 993 F. Supp.
1136, 1144-45 (S.D. Ohio 1997) (holding that 26 U.S.C. § 7431(a)(1), which
provides a mechanism for the award of civil damages for unauthorized
disclosure of tax return information (as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 6103), is the
“exclusive remedy by which [plaintiff] may bring a cause of action for
improper disclosure of return information”); Gov’t Nat’l Mortgage, Ass’n v.
Lunsford, No. 95-273, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1591, at *8 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 2, 1996)
(dismissing Privacy Act claim for wrongful disclosure (presumably brought
under subsection (g)(1)(D)) and stating that “26 U.S.C. § 7852(e) precludes
the maintenance of Privacy Act damages remedies in matters concerning
federal tax liabilities”).
Nevertheless, the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Eighth Circuits,
as well as the United States Tax Court, have readily applied the Privacy Act
as well as the provisions of the tax code to disclosures of tax return
information, with no discussion of the issue of preemption. See, e.g.,
Scrimgeour v. IRS, 149 F.3d 318, 325-26 (4th Cir. 1998) (affirming denial of
damages and finding that the agency had not acted with gross negligence
under 26 U.S.C. § 7431 or greater than gross negligence under the Privacy
Act for wrongful disclosure claims resting upon identical factual
allegations); Taylor v. United States, 106 F.3d 833, 835-37 (8th Cir. 1997)
(affirming finding that disclosures did not violate 26 U.S.C. § 6103 or
Privacy Act); Stone v. Comm’r of IRS, No. 3812-97, 1998 WL 547043, at *3
(T.C. Aug. 31, 1998) (finding that disclosures did not violate either 26 U.S.C.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

§ 6103 or Privacy Act). In addition, one district court specifically considered
the issue and arrived at the conclusion that the Privacy Act’s remedies are
available for the wrongful disclosure of tax return information. Sinicki v.
Treasury, No. 97 CIV. 0901, 1998 WL 80188, at *3-5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 1998)
(denying motion to dismiss Privacy Act wrongful disclosure claim and
stating that “the language, structure, purpose and legislative history of
Section 6103 do not make manifest and clear a legislative intent to repeal the
Privacy Act as it applies to tax return information”).
Several district courts have held that various sections of the Internal
Revenue Code prevent their exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over
Privacy Act claims brought under subsection (g)(1)(D) for alleged violations
of other provisions of the Privacy Act. See Welborn v. IRS, 218 F. Supp. 3d

Note also that some courts have held that the exclusivity provision of the
Federal Employees’ Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. § 8116(c) (2018), precludes a
cause of action under the Privacy Act. See, e.g., Smith v. Nicholson, 287 F.
App’x 402, 403-05 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (discussing where Labor
Secretary denied plaintiff’s FECA claim alleging that VA injured him by
disclosing his records “not for lack of coverage, but for insufficient proof,”
holding that “such a denial is conclusive as to FECA coverage”; “the
Secretary found FECA applicable” and “[t]hat decision precludes any
further action on [plaintiff’s] Privacy Act claim”); Richards v. CIA, 837 F.
Supp. 2d 574, 579-580 (E.D. Va. 2011) (dismissing Privacy Act claim because
“[t]he disclosures and the subsequent harm came exclusively in the context

his medical information by filing both FECA claim and Privacy Act claim);

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Subsection (g)(1)(D) suits cannot be used to collaterally attack agency
determinations.
Consistent with case law under subsection (g)(1)(C), the District Court for
the District of Columbia has stated that a plaintiff “cannot rely on any
arguable violation of the Privacy Act” under (g)(1)(D) – in that case an
alleged wrongful disclosure – to “collaterally attack” an agency personnel
decision. Hanna v. Herman, 121 F. Supp. 2d 113, 123-24 (D.D.C. 2000)

Principles Applicable to Damages Lawsuits
“In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(C) or (D) of this
section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which
was intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in an
amount equal to the sum of . . . actual damages sustained by the individual as a
result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery
receive less than the sum of $1,000.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Intentional or Willful Standard
Comment:
Damages suits under the Privacy Act require that the agency acted in an
“intentional or willful” manner.
In order for there to be any liability in a subsection (g)(1)(C) or (g)(1)(D)
damages lawsuit, the agency must have acted in an “intentional or willful”
manner. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4). The words “intentional” and “willful” in
subsection (g)(4) do not have their vernacular meanings; instead, they are
“terms of art.” White v. OPM, 840 F.2d 85, 87 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (per curiam);
see also Convertino v. DOJ, 769 F. Supp. 2d 139, 145-46 (D.D.C. 2011) (noting
that “[s]tandards of intentionality and willfulness are anything but rare in
the law” but explaining that “the Privacy Act’s intent or willfulness
requirement is peculiar to the Act and must not be confused with less
exacting standards parading under the same name from other common law
or statutory sources” (citing White)), rev’d and remanded on other grounds,
684 F.3d 93 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The Act’s legislative history indicates that this
unique standard is “[o]n a continuum between negligence and the very high
standard of willful, arbitrary, or capricious conduct,” and that it “is viewed
as only somewhat greater than gross negligence.” 120 Cong. Rec. 40,406,
reprinted in Source Book at 862, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview
_sourcebook.
While not requiring premeditated malice, see Parks v. IRS, 618 F.2d 677, 683
(10th Cir. 1980), cases analyzing subsection (g)(4) have held that, to meet the
“intentional or willful” standard, the agency’s actions must be:

-

So patently egregious and unlawful that anyone undertaking the
conduct should have known it was unlawful. E.g., Maydak v.
United States, 630 F.3d 166, 179-83 (D.C. Cir. 2010); Sussman v.

at 756-57; Albright, 732 F.2d at 189-90.

Negligence violations are insufficient to meet the “intentional or willful” standard.
A mere negligent or inadvertent violation of the Privacy Act is not enough
to clear this formidable “intentional or willful” barrier for a plaintiff seeking
damages. See, e.g., Lewis v. Mossbrooks, 788 F. App’x at 458 (concluding
that plaintiff’s complaint did not suggest that in failing to remove flag in his
record, any VA employee “‘flagrantly disregard[ed]’ Lewis’ privacy rights
or acted ‘without grounds for believing [their action] to be lawful,’ rather
than negligently.” (citations omitted)); Campbell v. SSA, 446 F. App’x 477,
479, 481 (3d Cir. 2011) (upholding district court conclusion that “there was
no record evidence to support an assertion of willful or intentional conduct”
where district court found that plaintiff’s “assertion that his wife discovered
some documents in her SSA file that should have been in his file, if true,
established nothing more than negligence”); Maydak, 630 F.3d at 179-83
(holding that BOP did not intentionally or willfully commit Privacy Act
violations because, among other reasons, records “were used only for
legitimate law enforcement purposes” and notwithstanding court’s “critical
discussion of the review and retention policies” in prior opinions, “BOP
officials were still never placed on clear notice that their practices violated
the Act”); Wilkerson v. Shinseki, 606 F.3d 1256, 1268 (10th Cir. 2010) (finding
standard not met where VA physician accessed plaintiff’s medical records
because physician testified that “he thought he could access the record so
long as he had a ‘need to know’” and “given that [plaintiff’s] health records
were relevant to whether he could continue working at the VA, [that] belief
was reasonable”); Scrimgeour, 149 F.3d at 326 (finding plaintiff did not

Parole Commission did not “‘flagrantly disregard’” plaintiff’s privacy when
it supplemented his file with rebuttal quantity of drugs attributed to him in
presentence investigation report (PSI) and offered inmate hearing
concerning accuracy of disputed report and concluding that “[e]ven if the
Commission inadvertently or negligently violated [plaintiff’s] Privacy Act
rights by not examining the accuracy of the PSI before preparing a
preliminary assessment . . . such a violation (if any) could in no sense be
deemed ‘patently egregious and unlawful’” (quoting Albright and
Laningham, infra)); Dowd v. IRS, 776 F.2d 1083, 1084 (2d Cir. 1985) (per

subsection (e)(2) claim where agency “assumed that it would be appropriate
to correspond with [plaintiff’s doctor] about [plaintiff’s] medical condition”
because “it was plaintiff’s doctor who made the first contact with the
[agency], offering unsolicited medical information on plaintiff’s behalf”);
Wiley v. VA, 176 F. Supp. 2d 747, 756-57 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (stating that even
if agency violated Privacy Act by disclosing VA claims file to employer

Daniels v. St. Louis VA Reg’l Office, 561 F. Supp. 250, 252 (E.D. Mo. 1983)

was not intentional or willful); Doe v. GSA, 544 F. Supp. 530, 541-42 (D. Md.
1982) (finding disclosure not “wholly unreasonable” where “some kind of
consent” given for release of psychiatric records and where agency
employees believed that release was authorized under GSA’s interpretation
of its own guidelines, even though court concluded that such interpretation
was erroneous).
In a number of other cases, courts have found that the plaintiff did not meet the
“intentional or willful standard” without deciding whether the agency had violated
the Privacy Act.
In addition to cases in which the court held that a mere negligent or
inadvertent violation of the Privacy Act was insufficient to meet the
“intentional or willful standard,” additional cases have concluded that
plaintiffs have failed to meet this high standard for a variety of other
reasons. See, e.g., Jacobs v. BOP, No. 12-5129, 2012 WL 6603085, at *1 (D.C.
Cir. Dec. 17, 2012) (holding that “appellant has failed to demonstrate the

authority in support of [plaintiff’s] contention that it is a violation of the
Privacy Act to transmit confidential materials (all but one of which was
covered by a transmittal cover sheet) to an unsecured fax machine, we agree

and cannot be, determinative”).
For claims based on alleged violations of subsection 552a(b), several courts have
required plaintiffs to identify the individual who disclosed the information in order
to establish that the disclosure was “intentional or willful.”
In the context of a claim for disclosure in violation of subsection 552a(b),
several courts have ruled that a plaintiff cannot show intentional or willful
conduct without identifying the individual or individuals who disclosed the
information. See, e.g., Convertino v. DOJ, 769 F. Supp. 2d 139, 146 (D.D.C.
2011) (“To meet the Privacy Act’s high standard for a showing of willfulness
or intentionality, [plaintiff] must know the leaker’s identity. . . . [L]acking
any evidence of the leaker’s identity, no reasonable fact-finder could find
that DOJ acted willfully or intentionally with regard to any leak in this
case.”), rev’d and remanded on other grounds, 684 F.3d 93 (D.C. Cir. 2012)
(reversing district court’s summary judgment and ruling that district court

Mich. Aug. 28, 2008) (“To establish that the DOJ committed a willful or

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Several district courts have allowed cases to proceed because the plaintiff sufficiently
alleged intentional or willful conduct.
Several district court decisions have found “intentional or willful” violations
of the statute, or have otherwise allowed cases to proceed after finding that
plaintiffs presented sufficient facts regarding an agency’s alleged intentional
or willful conduct. See, e.g., Ashbourne v. Hansberry, 302 F. Supp. 3d 338,
347-48 (D.D.C. Mar. 27, 2018) (“Accepting Ms. Ashbourne’s factual
allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, it is
plausible that the DHS defendants are liable for a violation of . . . the
Privacy Act.”); Kelley v. FBI, 67 F. Supp. 3d 240, 258 (D.D.C 2014) (finding
plaintiff “set forth sufficient facts about the alleged disclosure of information
about plaintiffs to the media to overcome the low threshold at the motion to
dismiss stage and create an inference of intentional and willful misconduct
that allows” plaintiff’s first claim to proceed); Babatu v. Dallas VA Med.
Ctr., No. 3:11-CV-00533, 2014 WL 626515, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 18, 2014)
(considering “scope of employment . . . to the extent that it may be probative

concluding that “an employee’s conduct, as well as the agency’s conduct, is
relevant to the determination of whether a violation was intentional or
willful”); Makowski v. United States, 27 F. Supp. 3d 901, 913 (N.D. Ill. 2014)
(finding that plaintiff “has sufficiently pleaded facts to support his claim
that DHS willfully violated its duty under the Privacy Act to maintain
accurate records” in light of fact that agency did not update plaintiff’s
citizenship status after being put on notice “not only that its record
pertaining to [plaintiff’s] citizenship status was inaccurate, but also that this
inaccuracy had the potential to contribute to an adverse immigration
enforcement determination regarding [plaintiff] – as it did with the issuance
of the 2009 detainer”); Minshew v. Donley, 911 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1072 (D.

even though purpose of disclosure was to “quell[] rumors and gossip”),
aff’d in part, vacated & remanded in part, on other grounds, 655 F.2d 327
(11th Cir. 1982).
At least two courts of appeals, the Sixth and Ninth Circuits, have found intentional
or willful Privacy Act violations.
At least two courts of appeals have found “intentional or willful” violations
of the statute – the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See Beaven v. DOJ, 622 F.3d 540, 547-53 (6th
Cir. 2010); Louis v. Labor, 19 F. App’x 487, 488-89 (9th Cir. 2001); Wilborn v.
HHS, 49 F.3d 597, 602-03 (9th Cir. 1995); Covert v. Harrington, 876 F.2d 751,
756-57 (9th Cir. 1989); cf. Oja v. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 440 F.3d 1122, 1136
(9th Cir. 2006) (concluding that “it was clear . . . that the [agency’s]
disclosures were intentional or willful” where agency posted information
about former employee on its Web site, but dismissing claim as untimely).
In Beaven, a group of BOP employees sued the agency for unlawful
disclosure after a BOP investigator left an “employee roster” containing
“sensitive personal information” on a desk in an area to which prisoners had
access. See 622 F.3d at 544-45. The district court had “found that [the
investigator’s] course of conduct resulted in a disclosure under the Privacy
Act . . . and that his actions were ‘intentional or willful’ within the meaning
of § 552a(g)(4), although his final act of leaving the folder unsecured was
‘inadvertent.’” 622 F.3d at 547; see also v. DOJ, No. 03-84, 2007 WL 1032301,
at *2, 14-17 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 30, 2007)). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit framed the “main issue” as “whether the requirement under
§ 552a(g)(4) that the district court find that ‘the agency acted in a manner
which was intentional or willful’ requires the court to find that the final act
that resulted in the disclosure was ‘intentional or willful’ or whether the
court may find that the entire course of conduct that resulted in the
disclosure was ‘intentional or willful.’” Beaven, 622 F.3d at 547. In holding
the latter to be correct, the Sixth Circuit pointed out that “[n]o court has
specifically interpreted § 552a(g)(4) in the light this panel must address” but
observed, after reviewing the case law, that courts “determining whether a
Privacy Act violation occurred have not differentiated between the final act
and the course of action that results in the final act, but rather courts
generally look to the entire course of conduct in context.” Id. at 548-50. The
Sixth Circuit went on to conclude that “the facts in the instant case support[]
the district court’s conclusion” and that the district court “did not commit
clear error in finding that [the investigator’s] course of conduct was
‘willful.’” Id. at 552. The court noted that the investigator had “carried the

folder, which he knew contain[ed] confidential and sensitive information,
into an inmate-accessible work area for the purpose of carrying out his own
investigative work should he need to call a . . . computer administrator at
home. Yet the roster [in the folder] not only listed the home telephone
numbers of . . . computer administrators but also included detailed private
and personal information related to all [of the prison facility] employees”;
and that the roster was not marked “[Limited Official Use]-Sensitive,” as
required by a BOP Program Statement, among other violations of BOP
policy. Id. The Court stated that the investigator’s “need for some of the
information . . . did not provide a legitimate basis for him to have the entire
contents of the folder with him at the time” and that his “course of conduct
that resulted in his leaving the unmarked folder in an inmate-accessible area
. . . could properly be viewed as ‘the intentional or willful failure of the
agency to abide by the Act.’” Id. at 552-53. See also Downie v. City of
Middleburg Hts., 301 F.3d 688, 697-99 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Toolasprashad,
infra, and stating that “[w]hile the Privacy Act does not provide a separate
damages remedy for the intentional or willful creation, maintenance, or
dissemination of false records in retaliation for an individual’s First
Amendment rights, we believe that retaliation on any basis clearly
constitutes intentional or willful action”).
In Louis, the plaintiff had sought reconsideration of the denial of his claim
for Federal Employees Compensation benefits by the Department of Labor.
See 19 F. App’x at 488. In denying the plaintiff’s request for reconsideration,
the Department indicated that it had considered the entirety of its prior
decision, including a portion of that prior decision that impermissibly relied
on a memorandum that had been the subject of prior litigation by the
plaintiff. See id.; see also Louis v. Labor, No. C99-5195, slip op. at 1-2 (W.D.
Wash. Oct. 15, 1999), aff’d in part, rev’d in part & remanded, Louis v. Labor,
19 F. App’x 487 (9th Cir. 2001); Louis v. Labor, No. C97-5521 (W.D. Wash.
Feb. 27, 1998) (magistrate’s recommendation), adopted, (W.D. Wash. Mar.
23, 1998); Louis v. VA, No. C95-5606 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 31, 1996). Yet, the
district court in a prior action had ordered that the agency “destroy all but
one known copy of the document” and that it “maintain that single copy in
a sealed envelope to be revealed to no person, agency, or entity.” Louis v.
Labor, No. C97-5521, slip op. at 3 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 27, 1998). The Ninth
Circuit ruled that the Department of Labor violated the Privacy Act when it
failed “to maintain its records in such a way as to indicate to the claims
examiner that it could not rely on [that memorandum] in reviewing Louis’
request for reconsideration.” 19 F. App’x at 489. The court stated that the
agency’s “disregard of both the district court’s prior decision rendering
reliance on [the memorandum] impermissible and its own assurance that it

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

would annotate the memo in its files ‘to reflect that it is not to be considered
in any future action related to Dr. Louis’ claim’ constitutes a willful failure
on the part of the government to abide by its obligations, and proximately
resulted in the government’s refusal to reconsider its earlier decision,
thereby adversely affecting [plaintiff].” Id.
In Wilborn, an attorney who had been employed by the Department of
Health and Human Services sought Privacy Act damages for an
Administrative Law Judge’s disclosure of adverse personnel information
about him in an opinion 49 F.3d at 599-602. The court ruled that the
“uncontroverted facts plainly establish that the ALJ disclosed the
information . . . without any ground for believing it to be lawful and in
flagrant disregard of the rights of Wilborn under the Privacy Act.” Id. at
602. The Ninth Circuit noted that not only was the ALJ personally familiar
with the Privacy Act and had advised his staff concerning the Act’s
disclosure prohibition, but further, that the ALJ had been informed by an
agency attorney that the language at issue was “inappropriate and should
not be included in the decision.” Id. Particularly troubling in this case was
the additional fact that all information pertaining to the adverse personnel
record was required to be, and in fact had been, removed from the system of
records by the ALJ as a result of a grievance action filed by the plaintiff. Id.
In Covert, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Department of Energy Inspector
General’s routine use disclosure of prosecutive reports, showing possible
criminal fraud, to the Justice Department violated subsection (e)(3)(C)
because, at the time of their original collection by another component of the
agency, portions of those reports – consisting of personnel security
questionnaires submitted by the plaintiffs – did not provide actual notice of
the routine use. 876 F.2d 751, 754-57 (9th Cir. 1989). The Ninth Circuit held
that the failure to comply with subsection (e)(3)(C) was “greater than grossly
negligent” even though the Inspector General was relying on statutes,
regulations, and disclosure practices that appeared to permit disclosure, and
no prior court had ever suggested that noncompliance with subsection
(e)(3)(C) would render a subsequent subsection (b)(3) routine use disclosure
improper. Compare id. at 756-57, with Chapman, 736 F.2d at 243, Wisdom,
713 F.2d at 424-25, and Bruce, 621 F.2d at 917.
The D.C. Circuit has found that plaintiffs submitted sufficient evidence to establish
that complaint alleging “willful or intentional” data breach could proceed.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not gone as far
as the Sixth and Ninth Circuits in finding an “intentional or willful”
[279]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

violation of the statute. It did find, however, that the plaintiff had submitted
sufficient evidence that a motion to dismiss was not appropriate. See In re
OPM Data Security Breach, 928 F.3d 42, 63–64 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (finding
Plaintiff’s complaint “clears that hurdle by plausibly and with specificity
alleging that OPM was willfully indifferent to the risk that acutely sensitive
private information was at substantial risk of being hacked”); Toolasprashad
v. BOP, 286 F.3d 576, 584 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (remanding case where district
court had found that record would not support finding of intentional and
willful action, and stating that, “[i]f proven, retaliatory fabrication of prison
records would certainly meet [our] definition [as articulated in Deters] of a
willful or intentional Privacy Act violation”).
Although only a few courts have addressed the issue, they have split over whether
the Privacy Act limits recovery of damages under state law or the Federal Tort
Claims Act for negligent disclosure.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that the Privacy Act –
with its stringent “greater than gross negligence” standard for liability –
does not indicate a congressional intent to limit an individual’s right under
state law to recover damages caused by the merely negligent disclosure of a
psychiatric report. See O’Donnell v. United States, 891 F.2d 1079, 1083-87
(3d Cir. 1989) (Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA” case). But see Hager v.
United States, No. 86-3555, slip op. at 7-8 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 20, 1987) (finding
Privacy Act preempts FTCA action alleging wrongful disclosure); cf. Doe v.
DiGenova, 642 F. Supp. 624, 629-30, 632 (D.D.C. 1986) (holding state
law/FTCA claim preempted by Veterans’ Records Statute, 38 U.S.C. §§ 33013302 (renumbered as 38 U.S.C. §§ 5701-5702 (2018))), aff’d in pertinent part,
rev’d in part & remanded sub nom. Doe v. Stephens, 851 F.2d 1457 (D.C. Cir.
1988).

Actual Damages
“In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(C) or (D) . . .
in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was
intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual [for]
actual damages sustained by the individual . . . but in no case shall a person
entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(4)(A).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Comment:
The Supreme Court has held that plaintiffs must show actual damages to be
“entitled to recovery” of the $1,000 minimum.
In issuing its first purely Privacy Act decision in the history of the Act, the
Supreme Court considered a decision by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit in which a divided panel held that in order to be entitled to a
statutory minimum damages award for violation of the Privacy Act, a
complainant must prove actual damages. Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. 614 (2004),
aff’g Doe v. Chao, 306 F.3d 170, 177-79 (4th Cir. 2002). Recognizing that the
Fourth Circuit’s opinion in Doe v. Chao “conflicted with the views of other
Circuits,” the Supreme Court granted certiorari. 540 U.S. at 618 (citing
Orekoya v. Mooney, 330 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2003); Wilborn v. HHS, 49 F.3d
597, 603 (9th Cir. 1995); Waters v. Thornburgh, 888 F.2d 870, 872 (D.C. Cir.
1989); Johnson v. IRS, 700 F.2d 971, 977, and n.12 (5th Cir. 1983); Fitzpatrick
v. IRS, 665 F.2d 327, 330-31 (11th Cir. 1982) (awarding statutory minimum
$1,000 damages, but denying recovery beyond the statutory minimum
because “appellant proved only that he suffered a general mental injury”).
The majority conducted “a straightforward textual analysis,” looked to the
Privacy Act’s legislative history, and ultimately, in a 6 to 3 decision,
concluded that the Fourth Circuit’s view was correct. Id. at 620-29. The
Court held that to meet the “entitle[ment] to recovery” language of
subsection (g)(4)(A) to qualify for the $1,000 minimum, showing “merely . . .
an intentional or willful violation of the Act producing some adverse effect”
is insufficient; “[the statute guarantees $1,000 only to plaintiffs who have
suffered some actual damages.” Id. at 627; deLeon v. Wilkie, No. CV 191250 (JEB), 2020 WL 210089, at *8 (D.D.C. Jan. 14, 2020) (finding plaintiff did
not suffer actual damages where his complaint was “devoid of allegations
that either incident — i.e., the disclosure of his personnel records or of his
pending disciplinary action — caused him to suffer any actual damages”);
Clutter v. Perdue, No. H-18-310, 2019 WL 1589942, at *8 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 28,

actual damages from unspecified Privacy Act violation); Taylor v. FAA, 351
F. Supp. 3d 97, 105-06 (D.D.C. 2018) (finding that because plaintiff’s
complaint “made no allegation whatsoever of pecuniary or economic harm
caused by the alleged Privacy Act violation, the court is foreclosed from
granting the $1,000 statutory award he seeks”); Otero v. DOJ, 292 F. Supp.
3d 245, 253-54 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’d sub nom. Otero v. DOJ, No. 18-5080, 2019

where court “identifies no support for an award of damages – actual or
otherwise – arising from a purported violation of the Privacy Act”);

Chichackli v. Kerry, 203 F. Supp. 3d 48, 57-58 (D.D.C. 2016) (dismissing
Privacy Act claim, in part, by finding plaintiff failed to demonstrate
“concrete and quantifiable damages” when pleading that several fraudulent
bank accounts were established in his name, fraudulent income tax returns
were filed under his social security number, and credit cards were issued
using his personal information where actual sum of damages was “still
undiscovered” and damages were “in an amount unknown at this time”);
Welborn v. IRS, 218 F. Supp. 3d 64, 82-83 (D.D.C. 2016) (dismissing Privacy
Act damages claim due to failure to plead actual damages where plaintiff
class alleged false tax returns were filed, future e-filing of taxes was
prohibited, lost time was spent dealing with ramifications of fraud, and
there was heightened risk of further identity theft); Pinkney v. VA, No. 1:07CV-00142, 2008 WL 4272749, at *5-6 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 11, 2008) (stating that
“the Supreme Court in Doe v. Chao carefully reviewed the statutory
language and legislative history and held that the minimum guarantee goes
only to victims who prove some actual damages”). As a result, the court
abrogated any prior case law that suggests that anything less than actual
damages is sufficient to entitle an individual to an award of the statutory
minimum $1,000 damages.
The District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals has considered in detail
whether plaintiff’s incurred costs constitute “actual damages.” The Court of
Appeals, in In re OPM Data Sec. Breach Litig., reversed the district court’s
decision dismissing a case involving a data breach that resulted in the
disclosure of the sensitive information of more than 20 million government
employees. 928 F.3d 42 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The court concluded that numerous
expenses that plaintiffs had alleged in its compliant incurred as a result of
the breach constituted actual damages, including legal fees to close
fraudulent accounts, unauthorized charges on a utility bill, credit protection
and/or credit repair services, new credit card accounts fraudulently opened
in plaintiffs’ names, loans taken out in plaintiffs’ names that became
delinquent, false tax returns filed using plaintiffs’ information that led to
delays in receiving federal and state tax refunds and the forgone time value
of that money, and the time plaintiffs’ took off work to resolve the
fraudulent tax return filing and to close a fraudulently opened account. Id.
at 64-66. Thus, the court determined that the plaintiffs adequately alleged
actual damages.

[282]

Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

After years of differing opinions in the circuits, in 2004, the United States Supreme
Court limited “actual damages” to pecuniary or monetary damages, abrogating
earlier cases that had found to the contrary.
Although Doe v. Chao settled the issue of whether actual damages are
required to recover either the statutory minimum or damages beyond the
minimum, and that actual damages include out-of-pocket expenses, the
Supreme Court did not rule explicitly on the issue of whether nonpecuniary
damages for mental injury – such as emotional trauma, anger, fear, or fright
– satisfy the definition of actual damages. Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. at 627 n.12
(noting division among Courts of Appeals on “the precise definition of
actual damages,” and stating “[t]hat issue is not before us, however”). Until
the Supreme Court answered this question eight years later in FAA v.
Cooper, 566 U.S. 284 (2012), discussed below, lower courts were divided on
the issue. Compare, e.g., Jacobs v. Nat’l Drug Intelligence Ctr., 548 F.3d 375,
378 (5th Cir. 2008), Johnson v. IRS, 700 F.2d at 974-80 (finding nonpecuniary
damages recoverable), and Parks v. IRS, 618 F.2d 677, 682-83, 685 (10th Cir.
1980) (stating that plaintiffs had “alleged viable claims for damages” where
only alleged adverse effect was “psychological harm”), with Fanin v. VA,
572 F.3d 868, 872 (11th Cir. 2009) (following Fitzpatrick in requiring
pecuniary losses), cert. denied sub nom. Perkins v. VA, 130 S. Ct. 1755
(2010), Hudson v. Reno, 130 F.3d 1193, 1207 n.11 (6th Cir. 1997) (citing
plaintiff’s failure to show “actual damages” as additional basis for affirming
district court decision and stating that “the weight of authority suggests that
actual damages under the Privacy Act do not include recovery for ‘mental
injuries, loss of reputation, embarrassment or other non-quantifiable
injuries’” (citing Fitzpatrick)), DiMura v. FBI, 823 F. Supp. 45, 47-48 (D.
Mass. 1993) (finding that “‘actual damages’ does not include emotional
damages”). See generally Doe v. Chao, 306 F.3d at 181-82 (finding that
plaintiff had “utterly failed to produce evidence sufficient to permit a
rational trier of fact to conclude that he suffered any ‘actual damages,’” and
thus stating that “we need not reach the issue of whether the term ‘actual
damages’ as used in the Act encompasses damages for non-pecuniary
emotional distress” where plaintiff “did not produce any evidence of
tangible consequences stemming from his alleged angst over the disclosure
of his [social security number]” to corroborate his “conclusory allegations”
of emotional distress); id. at 198 n.13 (Michael, J., dissenting) (stating that
“the majority’s holding commits this circuit to the position that the term
‘actual damages’ includes at least emotional distress that would qualify as
‘demonstrable’ under [Price v. City of Charlotte, 93 F.3d 1241 (4th Cir.
1996)]”).

[283]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

In Cooper, the Supreme Court settled this confusion by interpreting actual
damages to be “limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm.” 566 U.S. at
299. The plaintiff in Cooper had alleged that the agency’s “unlawful
disclosure . . . of his confidential medical information, including his HIV
status, had caused him ‘humiliation, embarrassment, mental anguish, fear of
social ostracism, and other severe emotional distress,’” but he “did not
allege any pecuniary or economic loss.” Id. at 289. In framing the issue, the
Court stated: “Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compensation
from the Government for mental and emotional harm, we must decide
whether the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act waives the
Government’s sovereign immunity with respect to such a recovery.” Id. at
291. The Court explained that any ambiguities in the scope of the waiver
must be construed “in favor of the sovereign.” Id. In reaching its
conclusion, the Court first observed that “‘actual damages’ is a legal term of
art” that has a “chameleon-like quality” because its “precise meaning . . .
‘changes with the specific statute in which it is found.’” Id. at 289-290. The
Court also picked up on its observation in Doe v. Chao, see 540 U.S. at 62526, that the civil remedies provision “‘parallels’ the remedial scheme for the
common-law torts of libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can
recover ‘general damages’” – which “cover ‘loss of reputation, shame,
mortification, injury to the feelings and the like and need not be alleged in
detail and require no proof’” – “but only if they prove ‘special harm’ (also
known as ‘special damages’)” – which “are limited to actual pecuniary loss,
which must be specially pleaded and proved.” Cooper, 566 U.S., at 295.
“This parallel,” the Court reasoned, “suggests the possibility that Congress
intended the term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special damages. The
basic idea is that Privacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or
slander, are barred from any recovery unless they can first show actual –
that is, pecuniary or material – harm.” Id. at 296. Finally, the Court placed
considerable emphasis on the fact that the Privacy Protection Study
Commission (discussed above under “Introduction, Privacy Protection
Study Commission”), which Congress established “to consider, among its
other jobs, ‘whether the Federal Government should be liable for general
damages,’” recommended that general damages be allowed; however,
Congress “never amended the Act to include them.” Id. at 297. After
Cooper, any prior case law suggesting that actual damages are not limited to
proven pecuniary or economic harm has been abrogated. See also Gause v.
DOD, 676 F. App’x 316, 318 (5th Cir. 2017) (concluding that plaintiff did not
allege actual damages because “mental and emotional distress . . . do not
meet the Supreme Court’s definition of actual damages under the Privacy
Act” and plaintiff did not provide sufficient factual enhancement to
establish “‘lost or jeopardized present or future financial opportunities,’” or

under the Privacy Act under Cooper) (citing Cooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1446, 145153, 1456).
Prior to Doe v. Chao and Cooper, the issue of what needs to be shown in
order to recover damages under subsection (g)(4)(A) had historically
engendered some inconsistent and confusing case law. See, e.g., Orekoya v.
Mooney, 330 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that “statutory damages [of
$1,000], if not actual damages, are available to individuals who suffer
adverse effects from intentional and willful violations of the [Privacy Act]
and that provable emotional distress may constitute an adverse effect”);

888 F.2d 870, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (stating that to obtain relief under the

of the Act; “(2) the violation of the Act was ‘intentional or willful,’” and “(3)
this action had an ‘adverse effect’ on the plaintiff” and that “[i]f these three
factors are satisfied, the plaintiff is entitled to the greater of $1,000 or the
actual damages sustained”); Johnson v. IRS, 700 F.2d 971, 977 & n.12, 986
(5th Cir. 1983) (recognizing entitlement to statutory minimum for proven

Limits on Injunctive Relief for Damages Claims
Unlike amendment and access claims under subsections (g)(1)(A) and (g)(1)(B),
injunctive relief is not available in damages claims under subsections (g)(1)(C) or
(g)(1)(D).
It is well settled that injunctive relief as provided for in the Privacy Act is
available only under subsections (g)(1)(A) (amendment) and (g)(1)(B)
[286]

(access) – both of which, incidentally, require exhaustion – and that
injunctive relief is not available under subsections (g)(1)(C) or (g)(1)(D). See,

exists to design or grant a remedy exceeding that established in the statutory
scheme.”); Shields v. Shetler, 682 F. Supp. 1172, 1176 (D. Colo. 1988) (Act
“does not create a private right of action to enjoin agency disclosures”); 120
Cong. Rec. at 40,406, reprinted in Source Book at 862, https://www.justice.

Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendant from using the allegedly altered records
in the course of further litigation, the statute in question does not authorize
the relief requested.”). But see Fla. Med. Ass’n v. HEW, 479 F. Supp. 1291,
1299 & n.8 (M.D. Fla. 1979) construing subsection (g)(1)(D) to confer
jurisdiction to enjoin agency’s disclosure of Privacy Act-protected record.
However, courts have recognized the availability of equitable relief under
the Administrative Procedure Act for claims governed by the Privacy Act
(see the discussion above under “Civil Remedies”).
Given the well-settled law that injunctive relief is not available for Privacy
Act damages claims, it would seem clear that injunctive relief is not
available for any damages claim, but the D.C. Circuit has suggested that
there may be an exception for subsection (e)(7) damages claims. In Haase v.
Sessions, 893 F.2d 370, 373-75 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the D.C. Circuit, in dictum,
suggested that its decision in Nagel v. HEW, 725 F.2d 1438, 1441 (D.C. Cir.
[287]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

1984), could be read to recognize the availability of injunctive relief to
remedy a subsection (e)(7) violation, under subsection (g)(1)(D); see also
Becker v. IRS, 34 F.3d 398, 409 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding that the IRS had not
justified maintenance of documents under subsection (e)(7), and stating that
“the documents should be expunged”); Scott v. Conley, 937 F. Supp. 2d 60,
81-82 (D.D.C. 2013) (dismissing plaintiff’s subsection (e)(7) claim on other
grounds, but stating “[a]lthough the Circuit did not explicitly decide the
question in Haase, its language suggests that injunctive relief for (e)(7)
violations under (g)(1)(D) would be available”); but see Wabun-Inini v.
Sessions, 900 F.2d 1234, 1245 (8th Cir. 1990); Clarkson v. IRS, 678 F.2d 1368,
1375 n.11 (11th Cir. 1982); Comm. in Solidarity v. Sessions, 738 F. Supp. 544,
548 (D.D.C. 1990), aff’d, 929 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1991); see also Socialist
Workers Party v. Attorney Gen., 642 F. Supp. 1357, 1431 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (in
absence of exhaustion, only damages remedy, rather than injunctive relief, is
available for violation of subsection (e)(7)). The D.C. Circuit’s view in Haase
is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the structure of subsection (g) and
with the case law mentioned above.
4.

Additional Considerations for Damages Claims
Plaintiffs are not entitled to the minimum recovery for each individual copy of a
document that is disclosed.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled that a
plaintiff was not entitled to $1,000 for each copy of a letter that was
disclosed in violation of the Privacy Act to 4500 individuals. See Tomasello
v. Rubin, 167 F.3d 612, 617-18 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The D.C. Circuit stated that
“[w]hile it may be linguistically possible to read the language [of
§ 552a(g)(4)] so as to forbid the aggregation of several more-or-less
contemporaneous transmissions of the same record into one ‘act[]’ or ‘failure
[to comply with the Privacy Act],’ the result [sought in this case] shows that
such a reading defies common sense.” Id. at 618. In reaching its
determination “that each letter disclosure was not independently
compensable,” the D.C. Circuit also reasoned that as a waiver of sovereign
immunity, subsection (g)(4) “must be construed strictly in favor of the
sovereign, and not enlarge[d] . . . beyond what the language requires.” Id.
(quoting United States v. Nordic Vill., Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 34 (1992)); cf.
Siddiqui v. United States, 359 F.3d 1200, 1201-03 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that
disclosure of tax information by IRS agent to 100 people in one room at one
time constituted one act of disclosure for purposes of determining statutory
damages under Internal Revenue Code).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

One court has allowed a plaintiff to recover mitigation costs for certain Privacy Act
claims.
One district court has applied the doctrine of mitigation to certain Privacy
Act claims, holding that “an individual whose information is disclosed in
violation of the Privacy Act may recover for costs incurred to prevent harm
from that disclosure.” Beaven v. DOJ, No. 03-84, 2007 WL 1032301, at *8
(E.D. Ky. Mar. 30, 2007) (concluding that “plaintiffs’ out-of-pocket expenses
[incurred in monitoring their financial information] to protect themselves
from potential harm were caused by the instant Privacy Act violation”),
aff’d in part, rev’d in part & remanded, on other grounds, 622 F. 3d 540 (6th
Cir. 2010).
There is a circuit court split as to whether an individual can file a damages action
when an agency destroys a Privacy Act record.
There is a split of authority on the issue of whether destruction of a Privacy
Act record gives rise to a damages action. Compare Tufts v. Air Force, 793
F.2d 259, 261-62 (10th Cir. 1986), with Rosen v. Walters, 719 F.2d 1422, 1424
(9th Cir. 1983), and Waldrop v. Air Force, 3 Gov’t Disclosure Serv. (P-H)
¶ 83,016, at 83,453 (S.D. Ill. Aug. 5, 1981). See also Vaughn v. Danzig, 18 F.
App’x 122, 124-25 (4th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (finding no Privacy Act
violation where record of nonjudicial punishment was maintained in files of
plaintiff’s military unit at time of his discharge, but later was destroyed
pursuant to records retention policy; “Although [plaintiff] seems to argue
that the Privacy Act requires that records be maintained in perpetuity, he
has cited no authority for that proposition”; “[A]gencies are not required to
retain records on the possibility that a . . . Privacy Act request may be
submitted.”); Dowd v. IRS, 776 F.2d 1083, 1084 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)
(declining to decide issue). Cf. Beaven, 2007 WL 1032301, at *16-17
(applying adverse inference because agency “destroyed the [records]
intentionally and in bad faith” and concluding that “[t]he inference is
conclusive as to disclosure, and the defendants’ conduct therefore
constitutes a violation of the Privacy Act”), aff’d, 622 F. 3d 540.

Principles Applicable to All Privacy Act Civil Actions
The Privacy Act does not provide relief from federal criminal prosecution, cannot be used
to collaterally attack a conviction or sentence, and is not a defense to a summons.
Several courts have stated that the civil remedies provided in the Privacy Act do
not provide for any relief in the course of a federal criminal prosecution. See,
[289]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

e.g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-87 (1994) (finding that claims for
unlawful actions that would render convictions or sentences invalid are
precluded unless there has been reversal on direct appeal, expungement,
invalidation, or issuance writ of habeas corpus); United States v. Bressler, 772
F.2d 287, 293 (7th Cir. 1985) (“[E]ven if the defendant had made a sustainable
argument [under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3)], the proper remedy is a civil action under
Section 552a(g)(1) of the Privacy Act, not dismissal of the indictment.”); United
States v. Bell, 734 F.2d 1315, 1318 (8th Cir. 1984) (asserting that even if appellant’s
(e)(3) argument was sufficiently raised at trial, “it cannot be a basis for reversing
his conviction”); United States v. Gillotti, 822 F. Supp. 984, 989 (W.D.N.Y. 1993)
(“[T]he appropriate relief for a violation of Section 552a(e)(7) is found in the
statute and allows for damages as well as amendment or expungement of the
unlawful records. . . . [T]here is nothing in the statute itself, nor in any judicial
authority, which suggests that its violation may provide any form of relief in a
federal criminal prosecution.”); cf. United States v. Moreno-Nevarez, No. 13-CR0841, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143900, at *10-14 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2013) (finding that
“[r]egardless of the merits of Defendant’s contentions regarding possible
violations of the Privacy Act, he has not presented grounds for suppressing the
information in his criminal case” and “[t]he Privacy Act explicitly creates
remedies for individuals harmed by violations of the statute”).
A plaintiff cannot use the Privacy Act to challenge a conviction or sentence. See
Skinner v. DOJ & BOP, 584 F.3d 1093, 1101 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (affirming dismissal
of damages claim under Privacy Act because claim is not cognizable unless
plaintiff first secures relief through writ of habeas corpus); Leventhal v. Rios, No.
0: 17–CV–05441, 2018 WL 3130682, at *3 (D. Minn. May 16, 2018) (indicating
Privacy Act claim not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 writ of habeas corpus
petition); Hill v. Smoot, 308 F. Supp. 3d 14, 22 (D.D.C. 2018) (“‘absent a showing
that the plaintiff’s conviction or sentence has been invalidated, . . . the plaintiff
cannot recover damages’ for the alleged one-month he spent in custody
following his arrest for a parole violation” (quoting Johnson v. United States, 590
F. Supp. 2d 101, 108–09 (D.D.C. 2008))); Semrau v. ICE, No. 5:13–cv–188, 2014
WL 4626708, at *5-*6 (S.D. Miss. Sept. 12, 2014) (finding claim that agency failed
to maintain accurate records about plaintiff to extent that they supported his
guilty verdict and deportation was collateral attack on verdict and barred by
law).
Several courts also have found that failure to comply with the Privacy Act is not
a proper defense to certain enforcement summons, such as a summons issued by
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). See, e.g., United States v. McAnlis, 721 F.2d
334, 337 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding that compliance with 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3) is not

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The Privacy Act does not preclude individuals from seeking remedies under the Federal
Tort Claims Act.
On the other hand, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
considered civil remedies for Privacy Act violations under the Federal Tort
Claims Act (“FTCA”) and held that the Privacy Act “does not limit the remedial
rights of persons to pursue whatever remedies they may have” under the FTCA
for privacy violations consisting of record disclosures. O’Donnell v. United
States, 891 F.2d 1079, 1084-85 (3d Cir. 1989); see also Stephens v. United States,
No. 0:16-149-BHH-PJG, 2016 WL 11200987, at *2-3 (D.S.C. Dec. 9, 2016)
(magistrate’s recommendation) (following O’Donnell), adopted in pertinent part
& rev’d in other part (D.S.C. Jan. 19, 2017); Rosado-Montes v. United States, 8 F.
Supp. 3d 55, 63 (D.P.R. 2014) (quoting O’Donnell and permitting FTCA claim
against VA employees who accessed plaintiff’s medical records to proceed
notwithstanding the Privacy Act); Beaven v. DOJ, No. 03-84, 2007 WL 1032301, at
*21-25 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 30, 2007) (assuming jurisdiction over claims of invasion of
privacy brought under FTCA and based on conduct held to violate Privacy Act,
but determining that plaintiffs failed to prove elements of those claims), aff’d in
part, rev’d in part & remanded, on other grounds, 622 F.3d 540 (6th Cir. 2010); cf.
Alexander v. FBI, 691 F. Supp. 2d 182 (D.D.C. 2010) (implicitly recognizing that
local or state common law tort and FTCA are alternative causes of action to
Privacy Act, but finding that plaintiffs had not met specific requirements to
prevail on those causes of action), aff’d on other grounds, 456 F. App’x 1 (D.C.

Alleged violations of the Privacy Act, however, cannot be the sole basis of a
FTCA claim. Coleman v. United States, 912 F.3d 824, 835-36 (5th Cir. 2019);
Burroughs v. Abrahamson, 964 F. Supp. 2d 1268, 1272 (D. Or. 2013) (explaining
that “[b]ecause plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim is rooted in federal rather than state
law, and because Oregon has no analogous law, plaintiff cannot allege a claim
under the FTCA for negligent violation of the Privacy Act”); Tripp v. United
States, 257 F. Supp. 2d 37, 45 (D.D.C. 2003) (dismissing plaintiff’s claim under the
FTCA for negligent disclosure of private information, as plaintiff could point to
no “duty analogous to that created by the federal Privacy Act under local law to
state a claim upon which relief [could] be granted”); Fort Hall Landowners
Alliance, Inc. v. BIA, No. 99-052, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27315, at *20 (D. Idaho

information” was “pre-empted by the Privacy Act”); Hager v. United States, No.
86-3555, slip op. at 7-8 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 20, 1987) (“Because the Privacy Act does
have its own enforcement mechanism” for plaintiff’s claims relating to disclosure
of confidential information, “it preempts the FTCA.”).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that the Feres
doctrine, which holds that “the [g]overnment is not liable under the Federal Tort
Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the
course of activity incident to service,” does not apply to the Privacy Act.
Cummings v. Navy, 279 F.3d 1051, 1053-58 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Feres v.
United States, 340 U.S. 135, 146 (1950), and concluding that “without regard to
the identity of the plaintiff or the agency she is suing, the [Privacy Act] plainly
authorizes injunctive relief . . . and monetary relief,” which remains “the best
evidence of congressional intent” that Feres doctrine “does not extend to Privacy
Act lawsuits brought by military personnel against the military departments”);
see also Chang v. Navy, No. 01-5240, 2002 WL 1461859, at *1 (D.C. Cir. July 8,
2002) (citing Cummings to vacate district court opinion that held suit barred by
Feres doctrine); Colon v. United States, 320 F. Supp. 3d 733, 742 (D. Md. 2018);
Gamble v. Army, 567 F. Supp. 2d 150, 155 n.9 (D.D.C. 2008) (concluding that
Feres “does not extend to Privacy Act lawsuits brought by military personnel
against the military departments”).
In an earlier decision, however, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit had
held that the plaintiff’s Privacy Act claims were barred under the Feres doctrine.
See Uhl v. Swanstrom, 79 F.3d 751, 755-56 (8th Cir. 1996); cf. Dickson v. Wojcik,
22 F. Supp. 3d 830, 839 (W.D. Mich. 2014) (citing Uhl favorably and finding that
“[w]hile there are cases finding that Feres generally does not bar a Privacy Act
claim, see, e.g., Cummings, the Sixth Circuit has not ruled on the question”);
Walsh v. United States, No. 1:05-CV-0818, 2006 WL 1617273, at *5 (M.D. Pa. June
9, 2006) (comparing, in dicta, Uhl and Cummings and noting that “[t]here is a
split of authority on whether the Feres doctrine bars Privacy Act claims”), aff’d
on other grounds, 328 F. App’x 806 (3d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 996
(2009). The Cummings opinion did not reference Uhl, the only other appellate
decision on this issue.
The Privacy Act’s remedies generally preclude monetary damages for constitutional
violations of government officials under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
Several courts have held that the Privacy Act’s remedies preclude an action
seeking monetary damages directly under the Constitution from individual
government officials under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). See Fazaga v. FBI, 965 F.3d 1015, 10571058 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that the Privacy Act and the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act “taken together, provide an alternative remedial scheme for
some, but not all, of Plaintiffs’ First and Fifth Amendment Bivens claims”); Liff v.

893 F.2d 595 (3d Cir. 1990). But see Hartley v. Wilfert, 918 F. Supp. 2d 45, 55-56
(D.D.C. 2013) (allowing plaintiff’s First Amendment claim under Bivens to move
forward because “the conduct here strays so far afield from the compass of the
Privacy Act that it cannot be said that Congress ever contemplated the sort of
claim here being covered by the statute”; defendant’s “actions here did not
involve the sort of collection of information contemplated by the Act, instead, his
words were merely a threat to intimidate [plaintiff] from continuing in her
speech, just as ‘I will arrest you if you continue to protest’ or ‘I will take a picture
of you for my book of crazy protesters’ would deter a person from speaking”);
see also Alexander, 971 F. Supp. at 610-11 (agreeing with outcome in Blazy and
Mittleman, supra, but concluding that their logic does not extend to prohibit
recovery under local law for torts committed by individuals who, although
government employees, were acting outside scope of their employment; holding
that “Privacy Act does not preempt the common law invasion of privacy tort”).
Courts have differed as to whether plaintiffs are entitled to additional remedies beyond
those available under the Privacy Act, particularly where other statutes are also
applicable.
The Supreme Court has addressed Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)
judicial review equitable relief issues for claims governed by the Privacy Act.
See 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 (2018). The Court stated that “[t]he Privacy Act says
nothing about standards of proof governing equitable relief that may be open to
victims of adverse determinations or effects, although it may be that this
inattention is explained by the general provisions for equitable relief within the
[APA].” Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. 614, 619 n.1 (2004); cf. OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40
Fed. Reg. at 28,949, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (stating in its
Civil Remedies section that “[a]n individual may seek judicial review under
other provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act”). Indeed, under the APA,
the D.C. Circuit enjoined the Veterans Administration from disclosing medical
records about an individual pursuant to a routine use that “would permit
routine disclosure pursuant to a grand jury subpoena,” stating the disclosure
would “circumvent the mandates of the Privacy Act.” Doe v. Stephens, 851 F.2d
1457, 1466-67 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (furthering the principle of “avoiding
constitutional questions if at all possible” where the plaintiff did “not premise
his claim for equitable relief on the APA,” but the court considered the claim
under the APA rather than resolving the plaintiff’s constitutional claims); see
also Fla. Med. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Health, Edu. & Welfare, 947 F. Supp. 2d 1325,

Privacy Act claim); cf. Haase v. Sessions, 893 F.2d 370, 374 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1990)
(stating in dicta that “[i]t is not at all clear to us that Congress intended to
preclude broad equitable relief (injunctions) to prevent (e)(7) violations . . . [a]nd
in the absence of such an explicit intention, by creating a general cause of action
(under (g)(1)(D)) for violations of the Privacy Act, Congress presumably
intended the district court to use its inherent equitable powers”); Rice v. United
States, 245 F.R.D. 3, 7 (D.D.C. 2007) (noting that “there is some authority for
awarding [declaratory] relief under the APA” for claims arising under Privacy
Act); Doe v. Veneman, 230 F. Supp. 2d 739, 752 (W.D. Tex. 2002) (enjoining

release would violate the FOIA and Privacy Act), aff’d in part & rev’d in part on
other grounds, 380 F.3d 807 (5th Cir. 2004).
However, courts in other cases have refused to allow claims brought under the
APA where the relief sought is expressly provided by the Privacy Act. See, e.g.,
Harrison v. BOP, 248 F. Supp. 3d 172, 181-182 (D.D.C. 2017); Westcott v.
McHugh, 39 F. Supp. 3d 21, 33 (D.D.C. 2014) (holding that “plaintiff cannot bring

Privacy Act claims); Echols v. Morpho Detection, Inc., No. C 12-1581, 2013 WL

Reno, 87 F. Supp. 2d 383, 393-94 (D.N.J. 1998); Mittleman, 773 F. Supp. at 449
(finding that plaintiff’s APA claim for failure to follow agency regulations and to
provide plaintiff with hearing or other opportunity to rebut allegations against
her in various government reports “is, in part, simply a restatement of her
Privacy Act claims . . . [for which] Congress has provided plaintiff with statutory
schemes and remedies through which she may seek relief”).
In considering whether plaintiffs had a cause of action under the Declaratory
Judgment Act (“DJA”), the D.C. District Court was recently “unconvinced” that
plaintiffs were precluded from obtaining declaratory relief under the DJA
“[b]ecause the Privacy Act provides for injunctive relief in specific situations.”
Morinville v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 442 F. Supp. 3d 286, 295 (Feb. 26,
2020). In Morinville, the plaintiffs filed numerous claims addressing the Patent
and Trademark Office’s former “Sensitive Application Warning System”
(SAWS), including a claim under the DJA requesting that the court declare that
SAWS violated the Privacy Act. Id. at 289. In assessing the defendant’s
arguments in its motion to dismiss, the court found none of the purportedly
supportive cases analogous to the situation, stating that “the Declaratory
Judgment Act explicitly carves out several claims for which parties may not seek
relief, and the Privacy Act is not among those carve-outs.” Id. at 295–96; see also
28 U.S.C. § 2201. Ultimately, the court held that “relief under the [DJA] may be
unnecessary, and the Court, in its discretion, may dismiss this claim. However,
at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court is not prepared to say that Plaintiffs’
[DJA] claim is duplicative of their Privacy Act claims or otherwise unnecessary
or inappropriate.” Morinville, 442 F. Supp. 3d at 296; cf. Schaeuble v. Reno, 87 F.
Supp. 2d at 393 (“Assuming that the Court does have discretion, because
Plaintiff, in good faith, tried to exhaust his administrative remedies, and it was
Defendants’ own failure to comport with the Privacy Act and its regulations that
impeded Plaintiff’s efforts to obtain administrative relief or exhaust his
administrative remedies, the Court declines to withhold exercising its authority
under the [DJA].”).
The District Court for the District of Columbia has analyzed the relationship
between the Privacy Act and the Health Care Quality Improvement Act
(“HCQIA”), Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3784, which “protect[s] patients from
incompetent physicians by establishing a database to collect information related
to professional competence or conduct which could adversely affect the health or
welfare of patients.” Doe v. Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 124, 125 (D.D.C. 2004).
In Doe, a dentist filed a subsection (g)(1)(B) claim against the Department of
Health and Human Services. Id. at 127. However, “instead of reviewing the
plaintiff’s request pursuant to the Privacy Act, the [Department] responded by
informing the plaintiff that the sole administrative remedy available to him was
[297]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

the procedures promulgated by the [Department]” pursuant to HCQIA. Id. The
court concluded that because the procedures promulgated by the Department
pursuant to HCQIA “provide less protection than the procedures required by the
Privacy Act,” the Department “must adhere to the requirements of the Privacy
Act when considering a dispute to a record” in the database established by
HCQIA. Id. at 130, 132-33.
The D.C. District Court also has analyzed the relationship between the Privacy
Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), 42
U.S.C. § 1320d-1320d-8 (2018), which “prohibits both the improper disclosure of
individually identifiable health information and the improper acquisition of such
information.” Cacho v. Chertoff, No. 06-00292, 2006 WL 3422548, *2 (D.D.C.
Nov. 28, 2006). In Cacho, the plaintiff brought a Privacy Act claim against the
Department of Homeland Security “on the theory that [a Department employee]
improperly accessed [the plaintiff’s] medical record.” Id. at *5. The court
dismissed this claim on the ground that it “would be inconsistent with both
HIPAA and the Privacy Act’s plain language” to “recognize under the Privacy
Act a private right of action that Congress has expressly denied under HIPAA.”
Id.
In addition, the District Court for the District of Columbia has dismissed a
plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim where the Attorney General invoked the State
Secrets Privilege. Edmonds v. DOJ, 323 F. Supp. 2d 65, 80-82 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d,
161 F. App’x 6 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (unpublished opinion). The court explained that
“because the . . . documents related to the plaintiff’s employment, termination
and security review that comprise the system of records are privileged, and
because the plaintiff would be unable to depose witnesses whose identities are
privileged or to otherwise identify through discovery the individual or
individuals who purportedly released the privileged information, the plaintiff is
. . . unable to proceed with her Privacy Act claims.” Id. at 81.
Courts may order expungement as equitable relief in actions under the Privacy Act or for
Constitutional violations.
Several courts, including the Unites States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, have held that a court may order equitable relief in the form of
the expungement of records either in an action under the Privacy Act or in a
direct action under the Constitution. See, e.g., Abdelfattah v. DHS, 787 F.3d 524,
284-285 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Doe v. Air Force, 812 F.2d 738, 741 (D.C. Cir. 1987);
Smith v. Nixon, 807 F.2d 197, 204 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Hobson v. Wilson, 737 F.2d 1,

equitable powers to expunge all the government records held by the Terrorist
Screening Center that supported its placement of [plaintiff] in the terrorist
databases” as court had no information about what those documents hold;
affirming district court and finding it reasonable for plaintiff to exhaust
administrative remedies under Traveler Redress Program); Dickson v. OPM, 828
F.2d 32, 41 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (suggesting that it is not resolved “whether as a

1982) (clarifying that court “[did] not intend to suggest that the enactment of the
Privacy Act in any way precludes a plaintiff from asserting a constitutional claim
for violation of his privacy or First Amendment rights. Indeed, several courts
have recognized that a plaintiff is free to assert both Privacy Act and
constitutional claims.”). See also the discussion of expungement of records
under “5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A) - Amendment Lawsuits,” above.
Finally, the courts have split over whether to grant class certifications in Privacy
Act cases. For cases in which courts granted class certifications for claims
brought under the Privacy Act, see Calvillo Manriquez v. DeVos, Case No. 17-cv07210-SK, 2018 WL 5316175 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 15, 2018); Rice v. United States, 211

Attorney Fees and Costs
“The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees
and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this
paragraph in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(2)(B), (g)(3)(B).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

“[T]he United States shall be liable to the individual . . .[for] reasonable
attorney fees as determined by the court.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4)(B).
Comment:
The Privacy Act is one of many federal statutes containing a “fee-shifting”
provision allowing a prevailing plaintiff to recover attorney fees and costs
from the government. It allows for such fees in both amendment and access
suits. 5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(g)(2)(B) (amendment), (g)(3)(B) (access). The Privacy
Act also allows for costs and attorney fees to be recovered in damages

Pro se litigants, whether or not they are also attorneys, are not entitled to attorney
fees for representing themselves.
The Supreme Court held that a pro se litigant who was also an attorney was
not entitled to recover attorney fees under the fee-shifting provision of the
statute authorizing attorney fees in civil rights suits against the government,
42 U.S.C. § 1988 (2018). Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432, 437 (1991); see also

DOJ, 709 F.2d 1051 (5th Cir. 1983), and recognizing and applying Kay when
ruling that “pro se attorneys are ineligible for fee awards under FOIA”).
Although the Supreme Court in Kay did not expressly rule on the issue of
the award of attorney fees to non-attorney pro se litigants, the Court
recognized that “the Circuits are in agreement . . . that a pro se litigant who
is not a lawyer is not entitled to attorney’s fees” and was “satisfied that
[those cases so holding] were correctly decided.” 499 U.S. at 435.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The Court’s rationale in Kay would seem to preclude an award of fees to
any pro se Privacy Act litigant, as the Court observed that “awards of
counsel fees to pro se litigants – even if limited to those who are members of
the bar – would create a disincentive to employ counsel” and that “[t]he
statutory policy of furthering the successful prosecution of meritorious
claims is better served by a rule that creates an incentive to retain counsel in
every such case.” Id. at 438; see also Wilborn v. HHS, No. 91-538, slip op. at
14-16 (D. Or. Mar. 5, 1996) (rejecting argument that rationale in Kay should
be construed as applying only to district court stage of litigation; “policy of
the Privacy Act . . . would be better served by a rule that creates an incentive
to retain counsel at all stages of the litigation, including appeals”), appeal
voluntarily dismissed, No. 96-35569 (9th Cir. June 3, 1996); but cf. Smith v.
O’Brien, No. 94-41371, 1995 WL 413052, at *2 (5th Cir. June 19, 1995) (per
curiam) (citing Barrett v. Customs, infra, and stating: “Pro se litigants are
not entitled to attorney fees under either the FOIA or the Privacy Act unless
the litigant is also an attorney”).
Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit summarily
affirmed a district court decision which held that a “nonattorney pro se
litigant cannot recover attorney’s fees under the Privacy Act.” Sellers v.
BOP, No. 87-2048, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 787, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 26, 1993),
summary affirmance granted, No. 93-5090, 1993 WL 301032 (D.C. Cir. July
27, 1993). See also Smith v. O’Brien, 1995 WL 413052, at *2 (“Pro se litigants
are not entitled to attorney fees under either the FOIA or the Privacy Act
unless the litigant is also an attorney.”); Barrett v. Customs, 651 F.2d 1087,
1089 (5th Cir. 1981) (denying a non-attorney pro se litigant fees); Riser v.
State, No. 09-3273, 2010 WL 4284925, at *8 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 22, 2010) (citing
Barrett and Smith and denying non-attorney pro se plaintiff’s request for
attorney fees); Westendorf v. IRS, No. 3:92-cv-761WS, 1994 WL 714011, at *2
(S.D. Miss. July 7, 1994) (citing Barrett and holding that non-attorney pro se
plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees because there was no evidence pro se
plaintiff was an attorney), appeal dismissed, No. 94-60503, slip op. at 2-3
(5th Cir. Nov. 17, 1994) (stating that district court’s holding is correct under
Barrett).
The D.C. Circuit has further ruled, however, that a plaintiff’s pro se status
does not preclude the recovery of fees for “consultations” with outside
counsel. Blazy v. Tenet, 194 F.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also id. at 98-99
(Sentelle, J., concurring but “writ[ing] separately only to distance [him]self
from the majority’s determination that a pro se litigant is entitled to recover
counsel fees for consultations with attorneys not appearing or connected
with appearances in the pro se litigation”).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The courts are split as to whether courts considering Privacy Act fee claims should
consult FOIA cases.
The subsection (g)(2)(B) and (g)(3)(B) attorney fees provisions for
amendment and access suits under the Privacy Act are similar to 5 U.S.C.
§ 552(a)(4)(E), the FOIA’s attorney fees provision. Courts are split regarding
whether a court may consult FOIA decisions concerning a plaintiff’s
eligibility for attorney fees when assessing a plaintiff’s eligibility for
attorney fees under the Privacy Act. The D.C. Circuit has expressly ruled
that the FOIA’s criteria for determining a plaintiff’s entitlement to attorney
fees are inapplicable to a claim for fees under the Privacy Act. Blazy, 194
F.3d at 95-97 (“Even a cursory examination of these factors makes it clear
that they have little or no relevance in the context of the Privacy Act.”); see
also Herring v. VA, No. 94-55955, 1996 WL 32147, at *5-6 (9th Cir. Jan. 26,
1996) (finding plaintiff to be “prevailing party” on access claim for her
medical record with no mention or application of FOIA criteria); but see
Sweatt v. Navy, 683 F.2d 420, 423 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (stating in dicta that cases
construing whether plaintiffs had “substantially prevailed” for purposes of
attorney fee provision in FOIA are apposite in Privacy Act context, although
Blazy court distanced itself from this language).
On the other hand, the Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals
have held that the FOIA’s fee entitlement criteria apply to Privacy Act
claims for attorney fees. See Gowan v. Air Force, 148 F.3d 1182, 1194-95
(10th Cir. 1998) (applying the FOIA’s criteria and determining that plaintiff
was not entitled to fees because his “suit was for his personal benefit rather
than for the benefit of the public interest”); see also Reinbold v. Evers, 187
F.3d 348, 362 (4th Cir. 1999) (citing Gowan and stating in dicta that if
determination is made that plaintiff substantially prevailed, court must
evaluate FOIA factors to determine entitlement); Barrett v. Customs, 651
F.2d at 1088 (stating that FOIA’s guidelines apply to claims for attorney fees
under Privacy Act).
Despite the evolution of the “catalyst” theory under the FOIA, the courts have not
definitively ruled on its applicability in Privacy Act cases.
In the FOIA context, the Supreme Court held in 2001 that “the ‘catalyst
theory’ is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney’s
fees.” Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health &
Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 610 (2001). In 2002, the D.C. Circuit
followed that approach, holding that “in order for plaintiffs in FOIA actions
to become eligible for an award of attorney’s fees, they must have ‘been
[302]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

awarded some relief by [a] court,’ either in a judgment on the merits or in a
court-ordered consent decree.” Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int’l Union v.
Energy, 288 F.3d 452, 455-56 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting and applying
Buckhannon). This interpretation of Buckhannon was widely followed for
years, with the result that plaintiffs were denied attorney fees in FOIA cases
in which the agency voluntarily disclosed the records at issue. See, e.g.,
Union of Needletrades, Indus. & Textile Employees v. INS, 336 F.3d 200, 206
(2d Cir. 2003); McBride v. Army, No. 06-4082, 2007 WL 1017328, at *3-4 (E.D.
La. Mar. 30, 2007); Poulsen v. Customs & Border Prot., No. 06-1743, 2007 WL
160945, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 2007); Landers v. Air Force, 257 F. Supp. 2d
1011, 1012 (S.D. Ohio 2003).
However, Congress amended the FOIA in 2007 to explicitly provide for
attorney fees under a “catalyst theory.” See OPEN Government Act of 2007,
Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524. The FOIA now provides that a plaintiff
is eligible to obtain attorney fees if records are obtained as a result of “(I) a
judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree; or (II)
a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency, if the
complainant’s claim is not insubstantial.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(ii), as
amended; see also Brayton v. Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 641
F.3d 521, 525 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“The purpose and effect of this law, which
remains in effect today, was to change the ‘eligibility’ prong back to its preBuckhannon form.”); Davis v. DOJ, 610 F.3d 750, 752 (D.C. Cir. 2010)
(“Congress enacted the OPEN Government Act of 2007 to establish that the
catalyst theory applied in FOIA cases.”).
Although there has not been significant litigation regarding the “catalyst
theory” in Privacy Act fee cases, at least one case arising in the Fourth
Circuit, which, as noted above, has explicitly adopted the FOIA criteria for
determinations of entitlement to fees, applied the catalyst theory in the
Privacy Act context. Crockett v. VA, No. 7:17-CV-186, 2018 WL 1684284, at
*4 (W.D. Va. Jan. 19, 2018), report and recommendation adopted Crockett v.
VA, No. 7:17-CV-00186, 2018 WL 4550449 (W.D. Va. Sept. 21, 2018)
(applying catalyst theory but ultimately concluding that plaintiff had “not
produced evidence that his lawsuit was a catalyst for the VA’s production of
his records” and, therefore, was not eligible to recover attorneys’ fees); cf.
Reinbold v. Evers, 187 F.3d at 363 (recognizing without discussing catalyst
theory in pre-OPEN Government Act case but upholding denial of fees
where evidence showed that delay was result of staffing shortage rather
than “that [plaintiff’s] lawsuit was a catalyst for the [agency’s] action”);
Jacobs v. Reno, No. 3:97-CV-2698-D, 1999 WL 155708, at *4-5 (N.D. Tex. Mar.
11, 1999) (denying plaintiff’s request for attorney fees and costs, and stating

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

without using “catalyst theory” terminology that plaintiff’s argument that
his lawsuit caused agency “to comply with the Privacy Act when it would
not otherwise have done so” was “too slim a reed on which to rest” his
claim), aff’d, 208 F.3d 1006 (5th Cir. 2000) (unpublished table decision).
The impact of the OPEN Government Act in courts that have not tied the
Privacy Act fee analysis to the FOIA is less clear, given that not many cases
have addressed the issue. The D.C. District Court applied the “catalyst
theory” in a case in which the plaintiff sought fees under the FOIA along
with the Privacy Act but ultimately concluded that the plaintiffs had not
“substantially prevailed.” Mobley v. DHS, 908 F. Supp. 2d 42, 45 (D.D.C.
2012); but see Sterrett v. Navy, No. 09-CV-2083-IEG POR, 2010 WL 330086,
at *6 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 20, 2010) (applying different standards to Privacy Act
and FOIA fee claims).
Although not explicitly addressed in the Privacy Act context, enhanced fees to
compensate for risk in contingency fee arrangements generally are not permitted.
Under the FOIA, the D.C. Circuit had previously held that a fee
enhancement as compensation for the risk in a contingency fee arrangement
might be available in limited circumstances. See, e.g., Weisberg v. DOJ, 848
F.2d 1265, 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Supreme Court has clarified, however,
that such enhancements are not available under statutes authorizing an
award of reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing or substantially prevailing
party. City of Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 561-66 (1992) (prohibiting
contingency enhancement in environmental fee-shifting statutes). The
Court further observed that case law “construing what is a ‘reasonable’ fee
applies uniformly to all [federal fee-shifting statutes].” Id. In light of this
observation, there seems to be little doubt that the same principle also
prohibits fee enhancements under the Privacy Act. Id. at 562; see also King
v. Palmer, 950 F.2d 771, 775 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (en banc) (Silberman, C.J.,
concurring).
Courts appear to differ as to whether attorney fees and costs can be recovered even
without a showing of “actual damages.”
The Fourth Circuit held in a damages lawsuit brought under the Privacy
Act, that “[t]he face of [subsection (g)(4)] leaves no room for confusion on
this point” and “does not require a showing of actual damages . . . in order
to receive costs and reasonable attorney fees.” Doe v. Chao, 435 F.3d 492,
495-96 (4th Cir. 2006). The Fourth Circuit further explained that “the word
‘sum’ – as it is used in [subsection (g)(4)] – requires a court to fulfill the
[304]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

simple act of adding actual damages and fees and costs once the preceding
elements of the statute are satisfied,” and therefore, plaintiff who establishes
violation but does not recover damages is eligible for attorney fees. Id. In
reaching its decision, the Fourth Circuit rejected the government’s argument
that the Supreme Court had reached a contrary conclusion. Id. at 497, citing
Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. at 625 n.9. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals
analyzed the Supreme Court’s footnote in Doe v. Chao and concluded that
“in no place did the [Supreme Court] purport to interpret § 552a(g)(4)(B)”;
instead, “The Supreme Court’s phrase . . . means nothing more than the
obvious fact that the Government cannot be liable for actual damages if
there are no actual damages.” 435 F.3d at 497.
Although a subsequent decision of the District Court of the District of
Columbia questioned the Court Circuit’s conclusion, it did so in dicta. Rice
v. United States, 245 F.R.D. 3, 7 n.6 (D.D.C. 2007) (“There is some question as
to whether plaintiffs could recover costs and reasonable attorney fees under
section 552a(g)(4) even without showing actual damages. . . As Judge
Michael’s dissent in [Doe v. Chao, 435 F.3d at 507] points out, however, the
Supreme Court’s [opinion in Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. at 625 n.9] appears to
foreclose such a recovery.”).
Attorney fees are only available in amendment cases if the plaintiff has exhausted
administrative remedies; attorney fees are not available for administrative
representation.
The D.C. Circuit has held that attorney fees are not available in a subsection
(g)(1)(A) amendment case unless the plaintiff has exhausted his
administrative remedies. See Haase v. Sessions, 893 F.2d 370, 373-75 (D.C.
Cir. 1990); Sterrett v. Navy, 2010 WL 330086, at *6 (relying on Haase in
subsection (g)(1)(B) access case and concluding that “a fee award would be
improper because Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies”).
Attorney fees are not recoverable for services rendered at the administrative
level. See Kennedy v. Andrus, 459 F. Supp. 240, 244 (D.D.C. 1978), aff’d, 612
F.2d 586 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (unpublished table decision).
In addition to attorney fees, prevailing plaintiffs can also recover the costs of
litigation.
Litigation costs (if reasonably incurred) can be recovered by all plaintiffs
who substantially prevail. See Parkinson v. Comm’r, No. 87-3219, 1988 WL
12121, at *3 (6th Cir. Feb. 17, 1988); Walker v. DOJ, No. 00-0106, slip op. at 5[305]

attorneys’ fees.”), aff’d per curiam, 108 F.3d 343 (11th Cir. Feb. 13, 1997)
(unpublished table decision). Further, the D.C. Circuit held that a pro se

Jurisdiction and Venue
“An action to enforce any liability created under this section may be brought
in the district court of the United States in the district in which the
complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the
agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia. . .” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(5).
Comment:
Federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Privacy Act suits.
By its very terms, this section limits jurisdiction over Privacy Act matters to
the federal district courts. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(5). Accordingly, the U.S. Court
of Federal Claims does not have jurisdiction over Privacy Act claims. See,
e.g., Parker v. United States, 280 F. App’x 957, 958 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (affirming
Court of Federal Claims’ determination that “the Court of Federal Claims is
not the proper forum for such action. . . . district courts have jurisdiction in
matters under the Privacy Act”); Braun v. United States, 144 Fed. Cl. 560,
571 (2019) (“Any claims that plaintiff wishes to pursue under the Privacy
Act can only be brought in a District Court, and cannot be brought in this
court.”); Frazier v. United States, No. 16-1287C, 2016 WL 6583715, at *2 (Fed.
Cl. Nov. 1, 2016), aff’d, 683 F. App’x 938 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Madison v. United
States, 98 Fed. Cl. 393, 395 (Fed Cl. 2011); Treece v. United States, 96 Fed. Cl.

[306]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 794, 798 (Fed. Cl. 2006). Likewise, neither the
Merit Systems Protection Board nor the U.S. Tax Court has jurisdiction over
Privacy Act claims. See, e.g., Carell v. MSPB, 131 F. App’x 296, 299 (Fed. Cir.
2005); Martin v. Army, No. 00-3302, 2000 WL 1807419, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 8,
2000) (per curiam) (MSPB); Minnich v. MSPB, No. 94-3587, 1995 U.S. App.
LEXIS 5768, at *3 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 21, 1995) (per curiam) (MSPB); Strickland v.
Comm’r, No. 9799-95, 2000 WL 274077, at *1 (T.C. Mar. 14, 2000) (U.S. Tax
Court). Note, however, that final orders of the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) are reviewed in U.S. courts of appeals rather than
district courts, even where the case in question involves the Privacy Act. See
Creed v. NTSB, 758 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4-8 (D.D.C. 2011) (holding that judicial
review provision of Independent Safety Board Act, 49 U.S.C. § 1153(a),
operates to give exclusive jurisdiction to appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals
or Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review final
orders of NTSB).
D.C. Circuit decisions carry great weight in Privacy Act matters.
Because the Privacy Act specifically provides for venue in the District of
Columbia, the Privacy Act decisions of the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit are of great importance. Tyler v. U.S. BOP, 315 F. Supp.
3d 313, 315 n.1 (D.D.C. 2018), aff'd sub nom. Tyler v. BOP, No. 18-5187, 2019
WL 1752626 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 28, 2019) (“The venue provisions of both
the Privacy Act and the FOIA identify the federal district court in the
District of Columbia as a proper venue for such claims.”)
The text of the Privacy Act specifies the factors courts consider in making venue
determinations.
Courts considering venue have weighed the factors specified in the statute:
the plaintiff’s place of residence, the plaintiff’s principal place of business, or
the place where agency records are located. See, e.g., Akutowicz v. United
States, 859 F.2d 1122, 1126 (2d Cir. 1988) (finding “only proper venue for this
action is the District of Columbia” where plaintiff resided and worked
continuously in France and agency records were in D.C.); Shallow v. FBI,

plaintiff’s mailing address was there and complaint made “no mention of
Plaintiff having another residential address, a principal place of business,
nor where the alleged agency records may be located”); Schneider v.

795 F. Supp. 1457, 1467 (C.D. Cal. 1992) (“[I]n a multi-plaintiff Privacy Act
action, if any plaintiff satisfies the venue requirement of 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(g)(5), the venue requirement is satisfied as to the remaining
plaintiffs.”).
Although the Act specifies the D.C. District Court as an appropriate venue, that
court at times has transferred cases elsewhere.
The District Court for the District of Columbia is always a proper venue, but
the courts in the District of Columbia have transferred venue elsewhere
when “private and public interest factors” make another jurisdiction “the
more appropriate venue.” See Doe v. Army, 99 F. Supp. 3d at 162; see also
Hooker v. NASA, 961 F. Supp. 2d 295, 297 (D.D.C. 2013) (transferring venue
to Maryland where plaintiff lived there, agency was headquartered there,
[308]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

and “other potential sources of proof, including records” and witnesses
were in Maryland).
Similarly, in cases in which the plaintiff filed other claims in addition to a
Privacy Act claim, the courts in the District of Columbia have often
concluded that for purposes of judicial economy, the Privacy Act claim
should be heard in the same jurisdiction as the other claims. See, e.g.,
Valerino v. Holder, 20 F. Supp. 3d 203, 206 (D.D.C. 2013) (concluding that
Privacy Act claim was appropriately heard with Title VII claim in the
Eastern District of Virginia “in the interests of justice” because that is where
“the relevant conduct occurred,” and “most of the witnesses are located”);
Tildon v. Alexander, 587 F. Supp. 2d 242, 243 n.1 (D.D.C. 2008) (transferring
multi-claim cause of action to Maryland, even though Privacy Act allowed
venue in District of Columbia, because venue for other claims was Maryland
and “judicial economy . . . will be served by transferring this action in its
entirety”); Dehaemers v. Wynne, 522 F. Supp. 2d 240, 248-49 (D.D.C. 2007)
(concluding that appropriate venue for plaintiff’s Title VII and
Rehabilitation Act claims was Virginia and, although plaintiff’s Privacy Act
claims were properly in District of Columbia, court would not assume
pendant jurisdiction over other claims, and plaintiff could “pursue a single
action in [Virginia] either by seeking a dismissal without prejudice of his
Privacy Act claim, or by moving this Court to transfer his Privacy Act
claim”); Boers v. United States, 133 F. Supp. 2d 64, 65 (D.D.C. 2001)
(transferring case under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to plaintiff’s “home forum,”
even though “venue is proper” in District of Columbia, given that “[a]ll the
operative facts occurred in Arizona” and “it cannot be said that forcing a
plaintiff to litigate in his home district will prejudice or burden the plaintiff
in any way”), mandamus denied per curiam sub nom. In re Howard L.
Boers, No. 01-5192 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 28, 2001).
Generally, for plaintiffs who are in prison, the jurisdiction where the plaintiff is
incarcerated is the appropriate venue.
When the plaintiff is incarcerated, most courts have held that the
appropriate venue under the Privacy Act is the jurisdiction where the
plaintiff is incarcerated rather than the jurisdiction of his or her previous
domicile. See, e.g., Pinson v. DOJ, 74 F. Supp. 3d 283, 294 (D.D.C. 2014)
(finding that because plaintiff “is currently incarcerated in Colorado, a large
portion of the records and witnesses at issue are located in the state, and . . .
because of possible transportation difficulties,” Privacy Act claim is more
appropriately litigated in District of Colorado); United States v. Barrenechea,
No. 94-0206, 2013 WL 3014141, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 17, 2013) (“Given that

Barrenechea is incarcerated in USP-Victorville, coupled with the fact that the
challenged records are alleged to be located there, the Court notes that the
Central District of California, not the Northern District, appears to be the
appropriate venue for Barrenechea’s Privacy Act claims.”); United States v.
Cornejo, No. 94-0206, 2013 WL 3052913, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 17, 2013)
(following Barrenechea); Royer v. BOP, No. 1:10-cv-0146, 2010 WL 4827727,
at *4 (E.D. Va. Nov. 19, 2010) (“Royer’s domicile may well be in the Eastern
District of Virginia. However, in light of the fact that he is presently serving
a 20-year sentence and is confined in a federal facility in Colorado, Royer
has failed to set forth sufficient information establishing that he resides in
this District for FOIA and Privacy Act purposes.”); Harton v. BOP, No. 970638, slip op. at 3, 6-7 (D.D.C. Nov. 12, 1997) (stating that “the fact that the
Privacy Act provides for venue in the District of Columbia does not, by
itself, establish that each and every Privacy Act claim involves issues of
national policy,” and granting agency’s motion to transfer to the jurisdiction
where plaintiff was incarcerated, as complaint focused primarily on issues
specific to plaintiff); but see Pickard v. DOJ, No. C 10-05253, 2011 WL
2199297, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2011) (acknowledging that some courts
have interpreted comparable venue language under FOIA to “conclude that
residence is where the now-incarcerated defendant was last domiciled” and
“find[ing] more persuasive the cases holding that an individual resides
where he is incarcerated, at least for purposes of FOIA and the Privacy Act,”
but transferring case to jurisdiction where records were located).
One court has concluded that venue should be evaluated at the time the suit is filed.
Although apparently only one court has addressed the issue of whether
venue should be considered at the time the suit was filed or at the time the
cause of action arose, that court concluded that it would follow the general
rule that “courts determine venue based on the facts at the time the suit was
filed, not when the cause of action arose.” Schneider v. Brennan, 2016 WL
29642, at *2 (indicating that court “has not found any decision specifically
addressing this question in the context of a Privacy Act claim, but the
general rule is widely followed,” and referencing Daughetee v. CHR
Hansen, Inc., No. 09-cv-41, 2011 WL 1113868, at *4 (N.D. Iowa Mar. 25, 2011)
(collecting cases)).

Statute of Limitations
“An action to enforce any liability created under this section may be brought
. . . within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises,
except that where an agency has materially and willfully misrepresented

any information required under this section to be disclosed to an individual
and the information so misrepresented is material to establishment of the
liability of the agency to the individual under this section, the action may be
brought at any time within two years after discovery by the individual of
the misrepresentation. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
authorize any civil action by reason of any injury sustained as the result of a
disclosure of a record prior to September 27, 1975.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(5).
Comment:
Courts have split over whether the Privacy Act’s statement that suits “may be
brought . . . within two years” is jurisdictional.
The Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals and
some district courts have held that the statute of limitations is jurisdictional
in nature and have strictly construed it to be an “‘integral condition of the
sovereign’s consent to be sued under the Privacy Act.’” Bowyer v. Air
Force, 875 F.2d 632, 635 (7th Cir. 1989) (quoting Diliberti v. United States,
817 F.2d 1259, 1262 (7th Cir. 1987)); accord Harrell v. Fleming, 285 F.3d 1292,
1293-94 (10th Cir. 2002); Weber v. Henderson, 33 F. App’x 610, 611 (3d Cir.
2002) (per curiam); Davis v. DOJ, 204 F.3d 723, 726 (7th Cir. 2000) (per
curiam); Akutowicz v. United States, 859 F.2d 1122, 1126 (2d Cir. 1988);
Davis v. Gross, No. 83-5223, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 14279, at *3-4 (6th Cir.
May 10, 1984); Hussein v. Sessions, No. 16-cv-780, 2017 WL 1954767, at *4
(D. Minn. May 10, 2017), aff’d per curiam, 715 F. App’x 585 (8th Cir. 2018);
Jagun v. Rodriguez, No. 15-2230, 2016 WL 4124225, at *8 (D. Md. Aug. 3,
2016); Doe v. FDIC, No. 11 Civ. 307, 2012 WL 612461, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27,
2012); Mauldin v. Napolitano, No. 10-12826, 2011 WL 3113104, at *2 (E.D.
Mich. July 26, 2011); Bassiouni v. FBI, No. 02-8918, 2003 WL 22227189, at *2
(N.D. Ill. Sept. 26, 2003), aff’d on other grounds, 436 F.3d 712 (7th Cir. 2006);
Logan v. United States, 272 F. Supp. 2d 1182, 1187 (D. Kan. 2003); Mangino
v. Army, 818 F. Supp. 1432, 1437-38 (D. Kan. 1993), aff’d, 17 F.3d 1437 (10th
Cir. 1994) (unpublished table decision). Consequently, a plaintiff’s failure to
file suit within the specified time period has been held to “[deprive] the
federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the action.” Diliberti, 817
F.2d at 1262.
However, the courts of appeals “have not unanimously adhered to the view
that the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations is jurisdictional, such that a
plaintiff’s failure to file a Privacy Act claim within the Privacy Act’s
limitations period deprives a federal court of subject-matter jurisdiction over
the claim.” Carter v. DOD, No. 16-0786, 2017 WL 2271416, at *8 (D.N.M.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Feb. 28, 2017). The Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia and Ninth
Circuits, as well as other district courts, have concluded that there is a
“rebuttable presumption” in favor of equitable tolling in Privacy Act cases.
The D.C. Circuit held that the “‘rebuttable presumption’ in favor of
equitable tolling” in suits against the United States—the general rule
announced in Irwin v. VA, 498 U.S. 89, 95 (1990)—applies to the Privacy Act.
Chung v. DOJ, 333 F.3d 273, 277 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (overruling Griffin v. Parole
Comm’n, 192 F.3d 1081, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (per curiam)). The D.C. Circuit
concluded that “a Privacy Act claim for unlawful disclosure of personal
information is sufficiently similar to a traditional tort claim for invasion of
privacy to render the Irwin presumption applicable.” Chung, 333 F.3d at
276-77.
Although the D.C. Circuit appeared to limit its holding in Chung to
“claim[s] for unlawful disclosure of personal information,” 333 F.3d at 277,
the District Court for the District of Columbia has relied on Chung in
considering equitable tolling in other types of Privacy Act claims without
conducting the “similarity inquiry” articulated in Chung, 333 F.3d at 277,
with respect to the individual claims. See, e.g., Earle v. Holder, 815 F. Supp.
2d 176, 180 (D.D.C. 2011) (considering apparent (g)(1)(A) and (g)(1)(C)
claim, and applying principle that statute of limitations is subject to
equitable tolling “when the plaintiff ‘despite all due diligence . . . is unable
to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of his claim’” (quoting
Chung, 333 F.3d at 278)), aff’d per curiam, No. 11-5280, 2012 WL 1450574
(D.C. Cir. Apr. 20, 2012); Bailey v. Fulwood, 780 F. Supp. 2d 20, 23, 27-28
(D.D.C. 2011) (citing Kursar and Chung for proposition that Privacy Act
statute of limitations “is not a jurisdictional bar,” but ultimately dismissing
apparent (g)(1)(C) claim because “there is no reason in this case to toll the
running of the statute of limitations”); Kursar v. TSA, 751 F. Supp. 2d 154,
165-69 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding (g)(1)(C) claim not equitably tolled by
plaintiff’s MSPB action challenging employment termination), aff’d per
curiam, 442 F. App’x 565 (D.C. Cir. 2011).
The Ninth Circuit also has adopted the Supreme Court’s rebuttable
presumption approach from Irwin and held that Privacy Act claims brought
under subsection (g)(1)(D) and based on alleged violations of subsections
(e)(5) and (e)(6) “are sufficiently similar to traditional tort actions such as
misrepresentation and false light to warrant the application of Irwin’s
rebuttable presumption.” Rouse v. State, 567 F.3d 408, 416 (9th Cir. 2009)
(amended opinion) (citing Chung, 333 F.3d at 277). Because the Ninth
Circuit agreed with Chung that no aspect of the Privacy Act “militate[s]
against tolling,” the court concluded that “the Irwin presumption has not

Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

been rebutted.” Rouse, 567 F.3d at 416-17. However, the court “decline[d]
to decide whether equitable tolling is warranted on the facts of this case.”
Id. at 417. See also Boyd v. United States, 932 F. Supp. 2d 830, 838 (S.D. Ohio
2013) (interpreting Irwin, the court held that “[i]n the absence of specific
Congressional intent to the contrary, and considering the Privacy Act’s
similarity to privacy actions in tort . . . the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations
is a traditional statute of limitations”); Shearson v. Holder, 865 F. Supp. 2d
850, 867-68 (N.D. Ohio 2011) (noting the “split in the circuits as to whether
the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations is jurisdictional in nature” but
“agree[ing] with the courts that have adopted the Irwin approach and have
held that Privacy Act claims are sufficiently similar to privacy tort claims to
trigger the application of the Irwin rule”); Fort Hall Landowners All., Inc. v.
BIA, No. 99-052, slip op. at 6-7 (D. Idaho Mar. 17, 2003) (citing Irwin and
finding that the Privacy Act “does not use such language [of jurisdiction],
and therefore does not present a jurisdictional bar”). But see Gonzalez v.
United States, No. 18-cv-21789, 2018 WL 7825025, at *4-5 & n.5 (S.D. Fla. Oct.
11, 2018) (noting circuit split and that Eleventh Circuit “has not spoken” on
jurisdictional issue, and finding no need to decide the issue); Carter, 2017
WL 2271416, at *12 (stating that “in light of [Irwin], the Court agrees with
the Ninth Circuit’s and the D.C. Circuit’s reasoning that it does not make
sense to treat the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations as a jurisdictional bar”
but dismissing claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because “bound
to follow faithfully” Tenth Circuit precedent).
Statute of Limitations in Amendment suits
For Privacy Act amendment suits, the statute of limitations period begins when
the agency denies the plaintiff’s request to amend.
In a subsection (g)(1)(A) amendment suits, the limitations period begins
when the agency denies the plaintiff’s request to amend. See Englerius v.
VA, 837 F.2d 895, 897-98 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that the statute of
limitations “commences at the time that a person knows or has reason to
know that the request has been denied,” rather than as of the date of the
request letter); see also Djenasevic v. EOUSA, 319 F. Supp. 3d 474, 482-83
(D.D.C. 2018) (dismissing amendment claims filed in 2016 on statute of
limitations grounds because agency notified plaintiff of denial of request
to amend records in 2011), aff’d per curiam, No. 18-5262, 2019 WL
5390964, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 3, 2019); Otero v. DOJ, 292 F. Supp. 3d 245,
253 (D.D.C. 2018) (holding that limitations period began when agency
affirmed FBI’s decision to deny amendment of records), aff’d per curiam,
No. 18-5080, 2019 WL 4565497 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 4, 2019); Kursar, 751 F.

been denied”); Blazy v. Tenet, 979 F. Supp. 10, 18 (D.D.C. 1997) (citing
Englerius and finding that claim for amendment of sexual harassment
allegations in personnel file did not begin to run until employee
discovered that FBI, where plaintiff had applied for employment, never
received corrective letter from CIA, prior to which time plaintiff did not
and could not have known of CIA’s failure to amend), summary
affirmance granted, No. 97-5330, 1998 WL 315583, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 12,
1998). But see Campeau v. SSA, 575 F. App’x 35 (3d Cir. 2014) (per

knowing SSA received his request and failed to acknowledge receipt “not
later than 10 days (excluding [weekends and holidays]) after receipt,” as
required by § 552a(d)(2)(A)); Wills v. OPM, No. 93-2079, slip op. at 2-3
(4th Cir. Jan. 28, 1994) (per curiam) (holding that cause of action triggers
statute of limitations when plaintiff knows or should have known of
alleged violation, which in this case was when plaintiff sent his first letter
requesting amendment); Lee v. FBI, 172 F. Supp. 3d 304, 306-07 (D.D.C.
2016) (“Presumably Plaintiff knew or had reason to know that the

Alexander v. Mich. Adjutant Gen., 860 F. Supp. 2d 448, 456-57 (W.D.
Mich. 2012) (ruling that limitations period began when plaintiff was
terminated “approximately fifteen years prior to filing this action,” or
“[g]iving plaintiff every benefit of the doubt” considering several “other
dates that plaintiff could have claimed to have first ‘known,’” under any
of which “plaintiff’s complaint would have been untimely”); cf. Foulke v.
Potter, No. 10-CV-4061, 2011 WL 127119, at *3 n.4 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2011)
(holding plaintiff must amend complaint to plead Privacy Act
amendment claim, but noting that claim would likely fail “[s]ince the

two years prior); Evans v. United States, No. 99-1268, 2000 WL 1595748, at
*2 (D. Kan. Oct. 16, 2000) (finding that “plaintiff neither knew nor had
reason to know of the alleged error in his records until the receipt of
information provided by those witnesses who claimed the [Equal
Opportunity] Complaint Summary inaccurately reported their
testimony,” which prompted him to request “reconsideration and
reinvestigation” of information). One district court “f[ound] it troubling
that [a plaintiff] was aware of the existence of allegedly incorrect records
in 2002, but waited until 2009 to request amendment of his records.”
Kursar, 751 F. Supp. 2d at 167 n.11. “Nonetheless, the [c]ourt [was] not
aware of any limitations period for seeking an amendment in a statute or
otherwise compelled by binding case authority.” Id. (adding that “an
equitable defense such as laches may be applicable in this instance” but
declining to “consider the defense as it was not raised by” defendant).
Courts generally have held that the agency’s initial denial begins the limitations
period, rather than the date of an agency’s administrative appeal determination.
In determining what constitutes the agency’s denial, it has been held that
the agency’s initial denial should govern, rather than the date of the
agency’s administrative appeal determination. See Quarry v. DOJ, 3
Gov’t Disclosure Serv. (P-H) ¶ 82,407, at 83,020-21 (D.D.C. Feb. 2, 1982);
see also Singer v. OPM, No. 83-1095, slip op. at 2 (D.N.J. Mar. 8, 1984)
(rejecting claim that limitations period began on date plaintiff’s appeal
was dismissed as time-barred under agency regulation); cf. Shannon v.
Gen. Elec. Co., 812 F. Supp. 308, 320 & n.10 (N.D.N.Y. 1993) (finding that
cause of action for damages claim arose when plaintiff’s amendment
request was partially denied and noting that “no caselaw can be found to
support a finding that the pendency of the appeal has any affect upon the
running of the statute of limitations”).
In cases “[w]here the agency has not issued an express denial of the
request, the question [of] when a person learns of the denial requires a
factual inquiry and cannot ordinarily be decided on a motion to dismiss.”
Englerius, 837 F.2d at 897; see also Jarrell v. USPS, 753 F.2d 1088, 1092
(D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that issue of material fact existed and therefore
summary judgment was inappropriate where agency contended that
cause of action arose when it issued final denial of expungement request
but requester argued that due to agency’s excision of certain parts of
documents, he was unaware of information until later point in time);
Conklin v. BOP, 514 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2007) (denying motion to
dismiss as “the date on which plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the

alleged Privacy Act violations is unclear”); Lechliter v. Army, No. 04-814,
2006 WL 462750, at *3-4 (D. Del. Feb. 27, 2006) (denying motion to dismiss
because “[t]here does not appear to have been a final denial of [plaintiff’s]
request” and “there [was], rather, some question regarding what was
said” during a telephone call concerning status of request); cf. Bowles v.
BOP, No. 08 CV 9591, 2010 WL 23326, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 2010) (stating
that where “BOP failed to notify the Plaintiff one way or the other” of
action on his administrative appeal, “[t]he troubling failure of the BOP to
do their job and respond to Plaintiff’s claim, as well as the Plaintiff’s right
to be made aware of these deadlines by those that maintain complete
control over him are serious, factual questions that would need to be
addressed before the statute of limitations issue could be resolved” but
dismissing claim on other grounds without reaching these
considerations).
Statute of Limitations in Access suits
For Privacy Act access suits, the statute of limitations period begins when the
plaintiff knew, or should have known, of an agency’s failure to comply with the
Privacy Act’s access provision.
Courts have enforced the statute of limitations against plaintiffs in
subsection (g)(1)(B) access lawsuits where the plaintiff did not timely file
after he or she knew or should have known of the violation. See Melvin v.
SSA, 126 F. Supp. 3d 584, 603 (E.D.N.C. 2015) (finding plaintiff’s access
claim untimely because plaintiff was aware of violation, at the latest,
when she filed response in prior action stating that agency failed to
provide her medical records), aff’d per curiam, 686 F. App’x 230 (4th Cir.
2017); Zied v. Barnhart, 418 F. App’x 109, 113-14 (3d Cir. 2011) (per
curiam) (concluding that plaintiff “knew of the agency’s alleged errors
when defendant . . . sent her a letter that was unresponsive to her Privacy
Act requests and she responded”); Willis v. DOJ, 581 F. Supp. 2d 57, 69
(D.D.C. 2008) (ruling that “[a]pplication of the tolling doctrine is
inappropriate in this case” because plaintiff “had sufficient knowledge” to
bring action within limitations period); Levant v. Roche, 384 F. Supp. 2d
262, 270 (D.D.C. 2005) (concluding that plaintiff knew or should have
known that his access request was denied when Air Force issued final
decision on his Privacy Act and FOIA requests for documents); Bernard v.
DOD, 362 F. Supp. 2d 272, 278-79 (D.D.C. 2005) (determining that it was
“clear from the administrative record that the plaintiff knew or should
have known about his ability to request his medical records . . . when he
alleged he was denied them in the hospital at that time”); Logan v. United

States, 272 F. Supp. 2d 1182, 1187 (D. Kan. 2003) (finding that plaintiff’s
access claim was untimely as claim arose “when [the agency] disclosed
the records to Plaintiff”); McClain v. DOJ, No. 97-0385, 1999 WL 759505, at
*4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 1, 1999) (finding that action “would have accrued when

IRS records had been denied,” which was more than nine years before he
filed suit), aff’d on other grounds, 17 F. App’x 471 (7th Cir. 2001); Biondo
v. Navy, 928 F. Supp. 626, 632, 634-35 (D.S.C. 1995) (stating that 1987
request “cannot serve as a basis for relief for a suit brought in 1992
because the Privacy Act has a two-year statute of limitations,” and
making similar statements as to undocumented requests for information
made in mid-80s and in 1976-77), aff’d, 86 F.3d 1148 (4th Cir. 1996)
(unpublished table decision); Burkins v. United States, 865 F. Supp. 1480,

had been denied); Mittleman v. Treasury, 773 F. Supp. 442, 448, 450-51 n.7
(D.D.C. 1991) (holding that plaintiff “cannot attempt to resurrect” claims
barred by statute of limitations by making subsequent request more than
three years after she had first received information and almost six months
after complaint had been filed).
The only judicial discussion of the Supreme Court’s Irwin presumption of
equitable tolling in the context of an access lawsuit is found in Rouse v.
State, 548 F.3d 871, 876-77 (9th Cir. 2008), amended and superseded by
567 F.3d 408 (9th Cir. 2009). Although the opinion was superseded
(apparently on mootness grounds, see id. at 411 & n.1), the Ninth Circuit
determined that the Irwin rebuttable presumption did not apply to an
access claim because it “has no analog in private litigation.” 548 F.3d at
877-78.
Although the Privacy Act’s two-year statute of limitations applies in
subsection (g)(1)(B) access lawsuits, the FOIA’s 6-year statute of
limitations applies to the same access requests processed under FOIA. See
Spannaus v. DOJ, 824 F.2d 52, 55-56 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (concluding that 28
U.S.C. § 2401(a)’s six-year statute of limitations applies to FOIA actions),
overruled on other grounds by Jackson v. Modly, 949 F.3d 763, 778 (D.C.

Statute of Limitations in Damages claims
For Privacy Act damages suits, the statute of limitations period begins when the
plaintiff knew, or should have known, of an agency’s violation of the Privacy Act.
In damages claims, courts have deemed the statute of limitations to begin
running at the time the plaintiff knew or should have known of the
agencies Privacy Act violation. See, e.g., Chichakli v. Tillerson, 882 F.3d
229, 234 (D.C. Cir. 2018); Powell v. Donahoe, 519 F. App’x 21, 23 (2d Cir.
2013) (finding cause of action accrued when plaintiff “had actual
knowledge of the release of his records”); Jackson v. Shinseki, 526 F.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Some courts have held that once the plaintiff knows or has reason to
know of a record’s existence, even if based upon hearsay or rumors, the
plaintiff has a “duty to inquire” into the matter – i.e., “two years from that
time to investigate whether sufficient factual and legal bases existed for
bringing suit.” See Bowyer, 875 F.2d at 637; see also Diliberti, 817 F.2d at
1263-64 (stating that “[t]he hearsay and rumors which the plaintiff
described in his affidavit were enough to put him on notice . . . and to
impose upon him a duty to inquire into the veracity of those rumors”);
Mangino, 818 F. Supp. at 1438 (quoting Diliberti).
Generally, the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of records in
violation of the Privacy Act when the plaintiff suspects there is a violation
rather than when the plaintiff actually possesses those records or when
the government creates those records. See Diliberti, 817 F.2d at 1262
(stating that “relevant fact is not when the plaintiff first had physical
possession of the particular records, but rather when he first knew of the
existence of the records”); see also Duncan, 89 F. App’x at 636 (reasoning
that “a certainty, or testimony under oath, is not required to begin the
running of the limitations period, but rather ‘what a reasonable person
should have known’” (quoting Rose v. United States, 905 F.2d 1257, 1259
(9th Cir. 1990))).
Generally, constructive notice of the possible violation triggers the statute of
limitations for damages claims.
If the plaintiff has constructive notice of the possible violation, the statute
of limitations is triggered. See Diliberti, at 1262-63; see also Bowyer, 875 F.
2d at 636 (stating that when agency employee confirmed that agency
maintained private records on plaintiff relating to previous conflict with
his supervisor, he had sufficient notice of possibly erroneous records). In
the context of a damages action for wrongful disclosure, the D.C. Circuit
rejected the government’s argument that the limitations period
commenced when the contested disclosure occurred, and observed that
such an unauthorized disclosure “is unlikely to come to the subject’s
attention until it affects him adversely, if then.” Tijerina, 821 F.2d at 797.
But cf. Hill v. N.Y. Post, No. 08 Civ. 5777, 2010 WL 2985906, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.
July 29, 2010) (explaining that claim brought “against the unnamed BOP
staff for revealing private information regarding [plaintiff] contained in
his records . . . accrued . . . upon the publication of the articles describing
[plaintiff’s] affair”).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Consistent with the constructive notice theory, other courts have similarly
found that the statute of limitations began to run where the evidence or
circumstances indicated that the plaintiff knew of the violation or had
been affected by it. See Jackson v. Shinseki, 526 F. App’x at 817 (holding
that plaintiff was put “on notice of his … claim, that Defendants failed to
maintain his medical records in a way to ensure the fairness of his
discharge” when defendant informed him that agency did not “‘have a
copy of [the] psychiatric evaluation’ from his private psychiatrist that led
to his ability to return to work”); Zied, 418 F. App’x at 113-14 (ruling that
plaintiff “knew of the harm caused by” alleged inaccuracies in her SSA
records, at the very latest, “when her eligible child benefits were
stopped”); Lockett v. Potter, 259 F. App’x 784, 787 (6th Cir. 2008) (“EEOC
hearings that took place in March 2002 and April 2003, which addressed
[plaintiff’s] complaints that the Postal Service’s manner of storing and

knew about the alleged Privacy Act violation more than two years before
his March 2006 filing of his complaint.”); Harrell, 285 F.3d at 1293-94
(finding that the “limitations period began to run when [plaintiff] first
became aware of the alleged errors in his presentence investigation
reports” and that it was not “extended either by the government’s
subsequent actions or by his receipt of documents allegedly corroborating
his assertions of error”); Weber v. Henderson, 33 F. App’x at 612 (finding
plaintiff “knew that the entire file had been lost . . . when he was informed

rather than upon his receipt of records); Ertell v. Army, 626 F. Supp. 903,
908 (C.D. Ill. 1986) (finding limitations period commenced when plaintiff
“knew . . . that there had been negative evaluations in his file which ‘may

appellant’s wrongful disclosure claim was time-barred because in
accordance with principles of agency law, Privacy Act action accrued
from time her attorney received her records).
Some courts, however, have construed the beginning of the statute of limitations
period from other points, including when an individual discovers the inaccuracy
or mishandling of the record, receives a Privacy Act notice, or becomes aware that
an apparently untimely complaint “relates back” to a timely one.
In contrast to the constructive notice theory adopted by many courts,
some courts have suggested that the limitations period for a subsection
(g)(1)(C) damages action would commence when a plaintiff actually
receives his record – i.e., when he actually discovers the inaccuracy. See
Akutowicz v. United States, 859 F.2d 1122, 1126 (2d Cir. 1988) (noting that

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

One district court decision has also considered the statute of limitations in
connection with a Privacy Act claim under subsection (e)(3) concerning
the collection of information from individuals. Darby v. Jensen, No. 94-S569, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7007, at *7-8 (D. Colo. May 15, 1995), aff’d 78
F.3d 597 (10th Cir. 1996) (unpublished table decision). In that case, the
court determined that the claim was time-barred, as more than two years
had passed since the date upon which the plaintiff had received the
request for information. Id.
Several courts have considered whether a Privacy Act claim not
apparently raised in the initial complaint filed within the limitations
period could be found to “relate back” to the date of that earlier complaint
under Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Oja v. Army
Corps of Eng’rs, 440 F.3d 1122, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that
amended complaint did not relate back to filing date of initial complaint
because “[t]he fact that the language in the two disclosures is identical is
inapposite because [plaintiff’s] claims . . . are based on the acts of
disclosure themselves, each of which is distinct in time and place” where
agency posted information pertaining to plaintiff on website in November
2000 and posted same information on second website in December 2000);
Freeman v. EPA, No. 02-0387, 2004 WL 2451409, at *8-9 (D.D.C. Oct. 25,
2004) (concluding that even though “the new claim is similar in that it also
involves disclosure of information . . . it is hardly conceivable that the
defendants would have had notice regarding the new” claim, nor “does
the new claim build on facts the plaintiffs previously alleged other than
the very general factual context of the case,” and therefore, the claim fails
to relate back); Fort Hall Landowners All., Inc., No. 99-052, slip op. at 1315 (finding that Privacy Act wrongful disclosure claims first brought in
amended and second amended complaints related back to original
complaint); Tripp v. DOD, 219 F. Supp. 2d 85, 91-92 (D.D.C. 2002)
(holding that plaintiff’s subsequent Privacy Act accounting claim was not
barred by two-year statute of limitations because claim arose “out of the
same conduct and occurrences alleged in the initial Complaint,” which
dealt with improper disclosures of Privacy Act-protected records); cf. Yee

Privacy Act claim “should be denied because the proposed claim does not

absence of relation back, time-barred”), aff’d on other grounds, 472 F.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Equitable Tolling of and Exceptions to Statute of Limitations
Equitable tolling applies in damages claims.
As discussed above, the D.C. Circuit has held that the rebuttable
presumption in favor of equitable tolling that was established in Irwin
applies to the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations for a damages claim for
unlawful disclosure. Chung v. DOJ, 333 F.3d 273, 276-77 (D.C. Cir. 2003).
Further, because the D.C. Circuit could find no reason to think that
Congress did not intend to equitably toll the Privacy Act’s statute of
limitations, it held that the government did not overcome this
presumption. Id. at 278.
For other cases involving equitable tolling, see Hammoud v. U.S. Att’y,
No. 14-14398, 2015 WL 4756582, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 12, 2015 (holding
equitable tolling not appropriate when statute of limitations ran in 2009
and plaintiff’s equitable tolling argument was based on attempts to
contact agencies no earlier than 2012); Grethen v. Clarke, No. 2:13cv416,
2015 WL 3452020, at *2 (E.D. Va. March 13, 2015) (finding that plaintiff’s
Privacy Act claim should not be tolled because pendency of plaintiff’s
habeas action did not impact plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim); Boyd, 932 F.
Supp. 2d at 838-840 (stating Sixth Circuit’s five factors for determining
whether equitable tolling applies: “(1) lack of notice of the filing
requirement; (2) lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement;
(3) diligence in pursuing one’s rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the
defendant; and (5) the plaintiff’s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of
the particular legal requirement”; finding “[t]here is no question that
[plaintiff’s] claim in this Court was brought outside the Privacy Act
statute of limitations. Since the Court finds four of the five equitable
tolling factors favor equitable tolling . . . and that the fifth does not weigh
significantly against it, [plaintiff’s] suit is not barred by the statute of
limitations”); Padilla-Ruiz v. United States, 893 F. Supp. 2d 301, 306-09
(D.P.R. 2012) (finding equitable tolling “not a proper remedy to be
employed in this case” as plaintiff “makes no connection . . . between his
request of documents and the requirement that he needed to file suit
[within time period]”), aff’d in part, vacated in part, & remanded on other
grounds, 593 F. App’x 1 (5th Cir. 2015); Doe v. Winter, No. 1:04-CV-2170,

state court); Cooper v. BOP, No. 02-1844, 2006 WL 751341, at *3 (D.D.C.
Mar. 23, 2006) (applying equitable tolling where court had sealed inmate’s
presentence report because he “was unable to obtain vital information on
the existence of his claim until he could review the [report]”); Freeman v.
EPA, 2004 WL 2451409, at *9 (concluding that plaintiffs’ argument that
they needed additional discovery to support their claim was “insufficient
justification for this court to countenance any equitable adjustment to the
statute of limitations”); Fort Hall Landowners All., Inc., No. 99-052, slip
op. at 7 (holding that statute of limitations was not tolled based on facts
before court).
An exception to the two-year statute of limitations rule occurs when there is a
material and willful misrepresentation by an agency.
In addition, the statute’s own terms provide an exception to the
requirement that an action be brought within two years from when the
cause of action arose. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(5). When an agency materially
and willfully misrepresents information required by the statute to be
disclosed to an individual, and the information so represented is material
to establishing the liability of the agency, then the limitations period runs
from the date upon which the plaintiff discovers the misrepresentation.
Id.; see also Ciralsky, 689 F. Supp. 2d at 154 (finding where plaintiff
argued that “by allegedly denying [the plaintiff’s] request . . . for pertinent
information confirming his suspicion . . . the CIA committed a material
and willful misrepresentation of information required to be disclosed to
Plaintiff and material to establishing the liability of the Agency to him. . . .
Taking the factual allegations of the complaint as true, such
misrepresentation delays the start of the limitations period.”); Lacey v.
United States, 74 F. Supp. 2d 13, 15-16 (D.D.C. 1999) (concluding that
defendants made material and willful misrepresentations to plaintiffs by
telling them that they lacked evidence and should wait for agency to
finish its own investigation of claim before bringing suit, which tolled
statute of limitations until agency “confirmed that there was substance to
plaintiffs’ claim of violations”); Burkins, 865 F. Supp. at 1496 (“Accepting
Plaintiff’s claims of agency misrepresentation as true, the statute may
have been tolled.”); Pope v. Bond, 641 F. Supp. 489, 500 (D.D.C. 1986)

access, which “prevents the statute of limitations from running until the
misrepresentation is discovered”); cf. Sabatini v. Price, No. 17-cv-01597,

at *3-4 (S.D. Iowa Dec. 15, 2015) (finding defendants’ counterclaims of
material and willful misrepresentation were undermined by the fact that
the record contains forms signed by one of the defendants, and such
defendant “cannot now claim that [she] was uninformed, or misled, about
her Privacy Act Rights, when the form containing a statement of the
agency's Privacy Act policy was signed by [her] three separate times”);
Weber, 33 F. App’x at 612 (finding that even if court were to consider
claim not properly raised on appeal, “[t]here is no evidence in the record
to show that the failure to disclose [a memorandum that plaintiff claims
would have avoided much of the pending litigation] was the result of
willful misrepresentation”); Boyd, 932 F. Supp. 2d at 836 (“Even
accepting. . . that [agency] did ‘willfully and materially misrepresent’ facts
regarding the statute of limitations for [plaintiff’s] Privacy Act claim, such
a claim remains outside the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations exception”;
“In order for the exception to apply, the undisclosed information must be
material to the establishment of liability under the Act.”); Sims v. New,
2009 WL 3234225, at *4-5 (concluding that “[e]ven if Defendants concealed

99-5102, 1999 WL 1006404 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 1999) (per curiam); Munson,
No. 96-CV-70920-DT, slip op. at 4-5 (E.D. Mich. July 2, 1996) (finding
statement that agency could find no record of disclosure of report to state
police but that it would check further “does not provide any evidence of a
willful and material misrepresentation”).
Note that the Seventh Circuit has stated that this special relief provision is
necessarily incorporated into tests, such as the one set forth in Bergman,
which focus on when a plaintiff first knew or had reason to know of an
error in maintaining the plaintiff’s records. Diliberti, 817 F.2d at 1262 n.1;
see also Malewich, No. 91-4871, slip op. at 25-27 (D.N.J. Apr. 14, 1993)
(following Diliberti and precluding “the plaintiff from utilizing the
discovery rule as a basis for extending the permissible filing date”). The
government argued to the D.C. Circuit in Tijerina v. Walters that
subsection (g)(5) “makes sense only if Congress intended the normal
statutory period to commence at the time of the alleged violation,
regardless of whether the potential plaintiff is or should be aware of the
agency’s action.” See 821 F.2d at 797-98. The D.C. Circuit, however,
rejected that argument and stated:
[T]he clause providing for a more liberal limitations period in cases
of willful misrepresentation of material information . . . extends the
normal limitations period in order to ensure that the government
cannot escape liability by purposefully misrepresenting information
. . . In such cases, the Act allows the period to commence upon actual
discovery of the misrepresentation, whereas . . . for other actions
under the Act, the period begins when the plaintiff knew or should
have known of the violation. . . . [This] in no way affects the special
treatment Congress provided for the particularly egregious cases of
government misconduct singled out in the Act’s statute of
limitations.
Id. at 798.
Continuing violations generally do not toll the statute of limitations period.
Additionally, it has been held that “[a] Privacy Act claim is not tolled by
continuing violations.” Davis v. DOJ, 204 F.3d 723, 726 (7th Cir. 2000); see
also Bowyer, 875 F.2d at 638 (citing Bergman and Diliberti, and rejecting
argument that continuing violation doctrine should toll statute of

proposition); Bergman, 751 F.2d at 316-17 (ruling that limitations period

commenced when agency first notified plaintiff in writing that it would
not reconsider his discharge or correct his job classification records and
rejecting argument “that a new cause of action arose upon each and every

several allegedly improper disclosures over course of three years);
Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 132-33 (rejecting argument that “a new

[plaintiff’s] revised Report after [the agency] had been placed on notice of
a potential problem and before it reviewed the revised Report for

Shannon, 812 F. Supp. at 319-20 (stating that plaintiff “cannot revive a
potential cause of action simply because the violation continued to occur;
he can allege subsequent violations only if there are subsequent events
that occurred in violation of the Privacy Act”); cf. Baker v. United States,
943 F. Supp. 270, 273 (W.D.N.Y. 1996) (citing Shannon with approval).
But cf. Burkins v. United States, 865 F. Supp. 1480, 1496 (D. Colo. 1994)
(citing Bergman and viewing plaintiff’s harm as “continuing
transaction”).
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in Oja v. Army Corps of
Engineers, applied the single publication rule in a case involving a
subsection (b) claim based on multiple postings to two agency websites of
information pertaining to the plaintiff. 440 F.3d at 1130-33. Under that
rule, “the aggregate communication can give rise to only one cause of
action . . . and result in only one statute of limitations period that runs
from the point at which the original dissemination occurred.” Id. at 1130.
The court rejected the argument that “the continuous hosting of private
information on an Internet website [is] a series of discrete and ongoing
acts of publication, each giving rise to a cause of action with its own
statute of limitations.” Id. at 1132. Instead, the court held that the claim

[332]

was time-barred because the plaintiff filed it more than two years from
when plaintiff became aware of the first posting. Id. at 1133.
Moreover, a plaintiff’s voluntary pursuit of administrative procedures
should not toll the running of the statute of limitations, because no
administrative exhaustion requirement exists before a damages action can
be brought. See Uhl v. Swanstrom, 876 F. Supp. 1545, 1560-61 (N.D. Iowa
1995), aff’d on other grounds, 79 F.3d 751 (8th Cir. 1996); see also Majied

8, 2007); Mitchell v. BOP, No. 05-0443, 2005 WL 3275803, at *3 (D.D.C.
Sept. 30, 2005); cf. Kursar, 751 F. Supp. 2d at 168-69 (holding that statute of
limitations was not tolled by MSPB litigation regarding plaintiff’s
termination); Christensen v. Interior, 109 F. App’x 373, 375 (10th Cir. 2004)
(“[T]here is no basis for tolling the limitations period while Plaintiff
pursued his administrative claim [under the Federal Tort Claims Act],
because there is no administrative exhaustion requirement when a
plaintiff seeks damages under the Privacy Act.”); Grethen v. Clarke, No.
2:13cv416, 2015 WL 3452020, at *2 (E.D. Va. Mar. 13, 2015) (dismissing
Privacy Act claims as time-barred, noting that “pendency of the habeas
action does not impact Plaintiff’s claims under the Privacy Act”).
Finally, one district court has applied a provision of the Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act to toll the statute of limitations for a Privacy Act claim
brought by an active duty member of the U.S. Marine Corps. See Baker v.
England, 397 F. Supp. 2d 18, 23-24 (D.D.C. 2005), aff’d on other grounds,
210 F. App’x 16 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Under that statute, “[t]he period of a
servicemember’s military service may not be included in computing any
period limited by law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action
or proceeding in a court.” 50 U.S.C. § 3936 (formerly codified at 50 U.S.C.
app. § 526(a)).
4.

Jury Trial
There is no right to a jury trial under the Privacy Act.
Generally, the Seventh Amendment does not grant a plaintiff the right to
trial by jury in actions against the federal government. U.S. Const. amend.
VII. Under sovereign immunity principles, “the United States, as sovereign,
‘is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued … and the terms of its
consent to be sued in any court define that court’s jurisdiction to entertain
the suit.’” Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 160 (1981) (citations omitted).
[333]

U.S. Department of Justice

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Further, a plaintiff has a right to a jury trial only when the right has been
“unequivocally expressed” by Congress. Id.
The Privacy Act is silent on the right to a jury trial and, therefore, there is no

CRIMINAL PENALTIES
“Any officer or employee of an agency, who by virtue of his employment or official
position, has possession of, or access to, agency records which contain individually
identifiable information the disclosure of which is prohibited by this section or by
rules or regulations established thereunder, and who knowing that disclosure of the
specific material is so prohibited, willfully discloses the material in any manner to
any person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
fined not more than $5,000.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(i)(1).
“Any officer or employee of any agency who willfully maintains a system of records
without meeting the notice requirements of subsection (e)(4) of this section shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(i)(2).
“Any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record concerning
an individual from an agency under false pretenses shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and fined not more than $5,000.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(i)(3).
Comment:
The Privacy Act allows for criminal penalties in limited circumstances.
An agency official who improperly discloses records with individually identifiable
information or who maintains records without proper notice, is guilty of a
misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to $5,000, if the official acts willfully.
Similarly, any individual who knowingly and willfully obtains a record under false
pretenses is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine up to $5,000.
These provisions are solely penal and create no private right of action. See Palmieri
v. United States, 896 F.3d 579, 586 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (concluding that plaintiff’s
complaint “erroneously mixes and matches criminal and civil portions of the Privacy

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

TEN EXEMPTIONS
The Privacy Act explicitly exempts, or allows agencies to exempt, certain categories
of records, or information within a record, from certain Privacy Act provisions. One
“special” exemption allows agencies to exempt from the Privacy Act’s access and
amendment provisions information compiled in anticipation of civil litigation. Two
“general” exemptions allow agencies to exempt certain records from all Privacy Act
provisions except those specifically articulated as not subject to the general
exemptions. Seven “specific” exemptions allow agencies to exempt certain records
from Privacy Act provisions specifically articulated as subject to exemption.
A. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(5) - Special Exemption for Information Compiled for Civil
Action
“[N]othing in this [Act] shall allow an individual access to any information
compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(d)(5).
Comment:
Information compiled in anticipation of civil litigation is exempt from the Privacy Act’s
access and amendment provisions.
The subsection (d)(5) provision is sometimes overlooked because it is not located
with the other exemptions in sections (j) and (k). On its face, it is only an
exemption from the access provisions of the Privacy Act, but by implication, it
also operates as an exemption from the amendment provisions. See, e.g., Smith
v. United States, 142 F. App’x 209, 210 (5th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (holding that
plaintiff had no right to amend record that was “prepared in response to [his]
[Federal Tort Claims Act] claim” because it fell within coverage of the exemption
to access in subsection (d)(5) and, therefore, was “also exempt from the
amendment requirements of the Act” (emphasis added)).
Subsection (d)(5) shields from the Privacy Act’s general access provisions
information that is compiled in anticipation of court proceedings or quasijudicial administrative hearings. See 120 Cong. Rec. at 36,959-60, reprinted in
Source Book, at 936-38, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook.
Courts have found little difficulty applying the plain language of subsection
(d)(5). See e.g., Lewis v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 419 F.3d 970, 977 and n. 9 (9th Cir.
2005) (documents prepared in connection with anticipated civil litigation
recognized as exempt); Martin v. Office of Special Counsel, MSPB, 819 F.2d 1181,
1188-89 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (finding that proceeding before MSPB is quasi-judicial

information prepared in anticipation of disciplinary action of plaintiff were
properly withheld); see also OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28, 949,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (indicating intent for “civil
proceeding” term to cover “quasi-judicial and preliminary judicial steps”).
While the subsection (d)(5) exemption extends to any information prepared in reasonable
anticipation of civil liberation, even if prepared by non-attorneys, the exemption is not as
broad as FOIA Exemption 5.
Indeed, this Privacy Act provision has been held to be similar to the attorney
work-product privilege. See, e.g., Martin v. Office of Special Counsel, 819 F.2d at
1187-89; Hernandez v. Alexander, 671 F.2d 402, 408 (10th Cir. 1982); Mobley v.
CIA, 924 F. Supp. 2d 24, 60-62 (D.D.C. 2013). Furthermore, the attorney workproduct privilege has been extended to information prepared by non-attorneys.
See Varville v. Rubin, No. 3:96CV00629, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14006, at *9-12 (D.
Conn. Aug. 18, 1998) (citing Martin and Smiertka, infra, for proposition that
courts “have interpreted the exemption in accordance with its plain language
and have not read the requirements of the attorney work product doctrine into

whether Exemption (d)(5) exempts the documents from disclosure”); see also

from the Customs Service and the possibility of a sex discrimination action”).
While this provision may be applied broadly to “any information” compiled in
reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding and is not limited to
information prepared only by attorneys, it is not as broad as Exemption 5 of the
FOIA, which shields inter- or intra-agency communications that would be
privileged in litigation. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). For example, subsection (d)(5) of
the Privacy Act does not incorporate the deliberative process privilege, which
may be invoked by agencies to withhold records in response to FOIA requests.
See, e.g., Savada v. DOD, 755 F. Supp. 6, 9 (D.D.C. 1991).
Agencies cannot waive their rights to invoke the subsection (d)(5) exemption.
In addition, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an agency cannot
waive the applicability of subsection (d)(5). McCready, 297 F. Supp. 2d at 189-90
(concluding that “[s]ubsection (d)(5) states that ‘nothing in this section shall
allow’ access to information compiled in anticipation of a civil action” and that
“[s]ince ‘shall’ is a mandatory word,” the agency could not waive its right to
invoke subsection (d)(5)); see also Louis v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 419 F.3d at 979
(finding that an individual has no right to even demand information exempted
by subsection (d)(5)).
[340]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Agencies do not need to promulgate regulations to exempt information compiled for civil
litigation in accordance with subsection (d)(5).
Unlike all of the other Privacy Act exemptions discussed below, subsection (d)(5)
is entirely “self-executing,” inasmuch as it does not require an implementing
regulation in order to be effective. Louis, 419 F.3d at 479 (“Unlike the section (k)
exemptions, which require an agency to exempt a system from access through
rulemaking, subsection (d)(5) is a self-executing exception to the general access
granted to individuals in subsection (d)(1)”).

5 U.S.C. § 552a(j) - Two General Exemptions for Central Intelligence Agency

requirements (including general notice) of sections 553(b)(1), (2), and (3), (c), and
(e) of this title, to exempt any system of records within the agency from any part
of this section except subsections (b), (c)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through (F), (e)(6),
(7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i) if the system of records is –
(1) maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency; or
(2) maintained by an agency or component thereof which performs as its
principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal
laws, including police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to
apprehend criminals, and the activities of prosecutors, courts, correctional,
probation, pardon, or parole authorities, and which consists of
(A) information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual
criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of
identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition
of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and
probation status;
(B) information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation,
including reports of informants and investigators, and associated

(C) reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

the statement required under section 553(c) of this title, the reasons why the
system of records is to be exempted from a provision of this section.”
5 U.S.C. § 552a(j).
Comment:
The Privacy Act allows agencies to exempt certain records in systems of records
maintained by the CIA or criminal law enforcement agencies.
One district court has described subsection (j) as follows: “Put in the simplest
terms, what Congress gave Congress can take away, which it did here by
conferring on agencies the power to exempt certain records from the Privacy
Act.” Williams v. Farrior, 334 F. Supp. 2d 898, 905 (E.D. Va. 2004). The court
went on to explain that “Congress, at most, granted” an “inchoate right” to
individuals. Id. “[B]y specifically granting agencies . . . the power to exempt
certain records from the Privacy Act,” “Congress conditioned any right [an
individual] might have to assert a Privacy Act claim on whether [a particular
agency] exercises this power.” Id. Thus, “[w]hen [an agency] exercise[s] this
exemption power, any inchoate claim [an individual] may once have had [is]
extinguished.” Id.
For cases involving subsection (j)(1), which applies only to records maintained
by the CIA, see Alford v. CIA, 610 F.2d 348, 348-49 (5th Cir. 1980); Mobley v.
CIA, 924 F. Supp. 2d 24, 55-56 (D.D.C. 2013); Braun v. FBI, No. 18-cv-2145, 2019

Law Enforcement Components
Subsection (j)(2) applies to systems of records maintained by “an agency or
component thereof which performs as its principal function any activity
pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws.” This threshold requirement
is usually met by obvious law enforcement components such as the FBI,
DEA, and ATF. In addition, several other Department of Justice
components qualify to use the (j)(2) exemption, including:
-

the Federal Bureau of Prisons, see, e.g., Skinner v. BOP, 584 F.3d
1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2009); White v. Prob. Office, 148 F.3d 1124,

system).

Compiled for Certain Law Enforcement Purposes
In order to exempt certain records under the subsection (j)(2) exemption, agencies
must establish that the information is being compiled for one of the specifically
enumerated criminal law enforcement purposes.
Once an agency has satisfied the threshold requirement of establishing that
it is a law enforcement component, it must establish that the system of
records at issue consists of information compiled for one of the criminal law
enforcement purposes listed in subsection (j)(2)(A)-(C), e.g., to identify
criminal offenders, for a criminal investigation, or compiled at any stage of
the enforcement of the criminal laws. See, e.g., Mobley v. CIA, 806 F.3d 568,
586 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (finding that FBI’s records compiled for purpose of
ascertaining facts and circumstances of U.S. citizen’s detention abroad
satisfied legitimate law enforcement purpose); Jordan v. DOJ, 668 F. 3d 1188,

were exempt under (j)(2)(C), which permits agencies to exempt reports
identifiable to individual that have been compiled at any stage of
enforcement, from arrest through release); Boyd, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 87

App’x 704, 706 (3d Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (“Indeed, the BOP has exempted
its central record system, where an inmate’s PSI is located,” which was used
in plaintiff’s sentencing).
Agencies must publish the reasons for exempting each system of records under
subsection (j); it is not clear whether the stated reason limits the scope of the
subsection (j) exemption.
An important requirement of subsection (j) is that an agency must state in
the Federal Register “the reasons why the system of records is to be
exempted” from a particular subsection of the Act. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j) (final
sentence); see also 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k) (same). It is unclear whether an
agency’s stated reasons for exemption – typically, a list of the adverse effects
that would occur if the exemption were not available – limit the scope of the
exemption when it is applied to specific records in the exempt system in
particular cases. See Exner, 612 F.2d at 1206 (framing issue but declining to
decide it). As discussed below, a confusing mass of case law in this area
illustrates the struggle to give legal effect to this requirement.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Because of the broad scope of the subsection (j)(2) exemption, courts are deferential
to agencies in access suits under this provision and are not authorized to review
disputed information in camera.
Given the breadth of this law enforcement exemption, an agency’s burden of
proof is generally less stringent than under the FOIA, at least in the access
context. See Binion, 695 F.2d at 1192-93 (9th Cir. 1983) (referencing
legislative history in support of “a broad exemption” because these records
“contain particularly sensitive information” (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1416,
93d Cong., 2d Sess. 18 (1974))). Indeed, several courts have observed that
the Vaughn rationale requiring itemized indices of withheld records is
inapplicable to Privacy Act cases where a general exemption has been
established. Shapiro v. DEA, 721 F.2d 215, 218 (7th Cir. 1983), vacated as
moot sub nom. DOJ v. Provenzano, 469 U.S. 14 (1984) (finding moot because
Central Intelligence Information Act amended Privacy Act by providing that
agency cannot rely on exemption in Privacy Act to withhold records
accessible under FOIA); see also Campbell v. DOJ, 133 F. Supp. 3d 58, 69
(D.D.C. 2015) (concluding that DOJ Criminal Division system of records was
exempted from access provisions of Privacy Act under (j)(2) law
enforcement exemption but analyzing FOIA under provisions other than
section 7 law enforcement exemptions); Schulze v. FBI, No. 1:05-CV-0180,
2010 WL 2902518, at *15 (E.D. Cal. July 22, 2010) (concluding that the (j)(2)
“exemption is both categorical and enduring.”); Miller v. FBI, No. 77-C-3331,
1987 WL 18331, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 7, 1987).
Moreover, in access cases the Act does not grant courts the authority to
review the information at issue in camera to determine whether subsection
(j)(2)(A)-(C) is applicable. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(3)(A) (in camera review
only where subsection (k) exemptions are invoked); see also Reyes v. DEA,
647 F. Supp. 1509, 1512 (D.P.R. 1986), vacated & remanded on other
grounds, 834 F.2d 1093 (1st Cir. 1987). But see Exner v. FBI, 612 F.2d 1202,
1206-07 (9th Cir. 1980) (concluding that whether or not “district court had
statutory authority to review any of [the] records with respect to which the
government was claiming the (j)(2)(B) exemption . . . ” district court “did
examine the documents and concluded that they were exempt”); Bailey v.
BOP, 133 F. Supp. 3d 50, 57-58 (D.D.C. 2015) (declining to rule on BOP’s
asserted (j)(2) exemption until it had a chance to review documents in
camera). However, the lack of authority to review documents in camera
under this provision may be an academic point in light of the FOIA’s grant
of in camera review authority under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).

Courts are divided as to whether published reasons for the exemption limit the scope
of the exemption in access and amendment cases.
Most courts have permitted agencies to claim the subsection (j)(2) law
enforcement exemption as a defense in access and/or amendment cases –
some without regard to the specific records at issue or the regulation’s
stated reasons for the exemption. For cases regarding access, see, e.g.,

F. Supp. 3d. 367, 372 (D.D.C. 2015); Shapiro, 721 F.2d at 217-18.
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has gone so far as to hold that
subsection (j)(2) “‘does not require that a regulation’s rationale for
exempting a record from [access] apply in each particular case.’” Wentz, 772
F.2d at 337-38 (quoting Shapiro, 721 F.2d at 218). This appears also to be the
view of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. See Irons v. Bell, 596 F.2d
468, 471 (1st Cir. 1979) (“None of the additional conditions found in
Exemption 7 of the FOIA, such as disclosure of a confidential source, need
be met before the Privacy Act exemption applies.”); see also Reyes, 647 F.
Supp. at 1512 (noting that “justification need not apply to every record and
every piece of a record as long as the system is properly exempted” and that
“[t]he general exemption applies to the whole system regardless of the
content of individual records within it”).
The Ninth and Seventh Circuits have construed subsection (j)(2) law
enforcement exemption regulations to permit exemption of systems of
records from provisions of the Act even where the stated reasons do not
appear to be applicable in the particular case. See, e.g., Alexander v. United
States, 787 F.2d 1349, 1351-52 & n.2 (9th Cir. 1986) (dismissing subsection
(g)(1)(C) damages action – alleging violation of subsection (e)(5) – on ground
that system of records was exempt from subsection (g) even though
implementing regulation mentioned only “access” as rationale for
exemption); Wentz, 772 F.2d at 336-39 (dismissing amendment action on
ground that system of records was exempt from subsection (d) even though
implementing regulation mentioned only “access” as rationale for
exemption and record at issue had been disclosed to plaintiff). Note,
however, that the Ninth Circuit significantly narrowed the breadth of its
holding in Alexander. Fendler v. BOP, 846 F.2d at 550, 554 n.3 (9th Cir.
1988) (observing that agency in Alexander “had clearly and expressly
exempted its system of records from both subsection (e)(5) and subsection
(g) . . . [but that for] some unexplained reason, the Bureau of Prisons, unlike
[348]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

the agency involved in Alexander, did not exempt itself from [subsection]
(e)(5)”).
Further, in Fendler, the court appears to have moved toward an earlier,
narrow view stated in a concurring opinion in Exner, 612 F.2d at 1207-08
(construing subsection (j)(2)(B) as “coextensive” with FOIA Exemption 7 and
noting that “reason for withholding the document was consistent with at
least one of the adverse effects listed in the [regulation]”). Other courts
support this narrow construction. See, e.g., Powell v. DOJ, 851 F.2d 394, 395
(D.C. Cir. 1988) (per curiam) (finding that agency’s regulation failed to
specifically state any reason for exempting its system from amendment and
that reasons stated for exempting it from access were limited, and thus (j)(2)
does not permit an agency to refuse “disclosure or amendment of objective,
noncontroversial information” such as race, sex, and correct addresses);
Rosenberg v. Meese, 622 F. Supp. 1451, 1460 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (ordering access
to sentencing transcript contained in same exempt system of records on
ground that proffered “reasons are simply inapplicable when the particular
document requested is a matter of public record.”). Apparently, because the
contents of the particular records at issue were viewed as innocuous – i.e.,
they had previously been made public – each court found that the agency
had lost its exemption (j)(2) claim. Powell, 851 F.2d at 395; Rosenberg, 622 F.
Supp. at 1460.
3.

Additional Issues Relating to the Criminal Law Enforcement Exemption
Some courts have upheld agency regulations, consistent with the text of the
subsection (j) exemption, to exempt their systems of records from the Privacy Act’s
civil remedies provision.
The issue discussed above also has arisen when an agency’s regulation
exempts its system of records from subsection (g) – the Privacy Act’s civil
remedies provision. Oddly, the language of subsection (j) appears to permit
this. See OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,971, https://www.justice.
gov/paoverview_omb-75.
However, in Tijerina v. Walters, 821 F.2d 789, 795-97 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the
D.C. Circuit held that an agency cannot insulate itself from a wrongful
disclosure damages action (see 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b), (g)(1)(D)) in such a
manner. It construed the subsection (j) law enforcement exemption to
permit an agency to exempt only a system of records – and not the agency
itself – from other provisions of the Act. See 821 F.2d at 796-97. The result
in Tijerina was influenced by the fact that subsection (j) by its terms does not
[349]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

permit exemption from the subsection (b) restriction-on-disclosure
provision. Id. In Tijerina, the government argued that “subsection (g) is
‘conspicuously absent’ from the list” of specific provisions that are not
eligible for exemption under (j)(2), and that that “omission demonstrates
that Congress intended agencies to be able to elude civil liability for any
violation of the Act,” including subsection (b)’s disclosure prohibition. Id. at
795. While the D.C. Circuit noted that “some other courts ha[d] indicated in
dicta” to the contrary, “[h]aving considered the issue at length [in Tijerina],
in which it [wa]s squarely presented, [the Court] declined to follow that
view.” Id. (citing Kimberlin v. DOJ, 788 F.2d 434, 436 n.2 (7th Cir. 1986), and
Ryan v. DOJ, 595 F.2d 954, 958 (5th Cir. 1979)). In ruling that the exemption
does not operate in this manner the Court stated:
The Act’s statutory language, framework, and legislative
history persuade us that the government is urging a completely
anomalous use of the exemption provision that makes the Act a
foolishness. The interpretation offered by the government
would give agencies license to defang completely the strict
limitations on disclosure that Congress intended to impose.
Tijerina, 821 F.2d at 797. See also Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d 1346, 1351-52 (D.C.
Cir. 1991) (explaining that “the touchstone for an agency’s liability to suit
under the Act is the substantive obligation underlying the plaintiff’s claim”
and holding that a cause of action under (g)(1)(A) could “not lie with regard
to records that the agency has properly exempted from the Act’s
amendment requirements,” because “Tijerina merely held that an agency
cannot escape liability for violating non-exemptible Privacy Act obligations
simply by exempting itself from the Act’s remedial provisions”).
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has considered this issue as well
and followed the approach taken by the D.C. Circuit’s Court of Appeals.
See Shearson v. DHS, 638 F.3d 498 (6th Cir. 2011). Although the D.C. Circuit
in Tijerina had characterized cases as dicta, the Sixth Circuit viewed those
same cases as “implicat[ing] a Circuit split in authority,” and determined
that the D.C. Circuit “expresses the better view . . . [that] an agency is
permitted to exempt a system of records from the civil remedies provision if
the underlying substantive duty is exemptible.” Id. at 503-04 (remanding
claims brought under (b) and (e)(7)); Nakash v. DOJ, 708 F. Supp. 1354,
1358-65 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (agreeing with Tijerina after extensive discussion of
case law and legislative history). But see Saleh v. United States, No. 09-cv02563, 2011 WL 2682803, at *6 (D. Colo. Mar. 8, 2011) (magistrate’s
recommendation) (concluding that “Plaintiff has no private right of action

at *1 (D. Colo. July 8, 2011).
While other courts have indicated that agencies may employ subsection
(j)(2) to exempt their systems of records from the subsection (g) civil
remedies provision, generally, these cases suggest that the regulation’s
statement of reasons for exempting a system of records from the subsection
(g) civil remedies provision itself constitutes a limitation on the scope of the
exemption. See Fendler, 846 F.2d at 553-54 & n.3 (declining to dismiss
subsection (g)(1)(C) damages action – alleging violation of subsection (e)(5)
– on ground that agency’s “stated justification for exemption from

claim, but not wrongful disclosure claim, on ground that record system was
exempt from subsection (g) because regulation mentioned only “access” as
reason for exemption); Nakash, 708 F. Supp. at 1365 (alternative holding)
(declining to dismiss wrongful disclosure action for same reason); Kimberlin
v. DOJ, 605 F. Supp. 79, 82 (N.D. Ill. 1985), aff’d, 788 F.2d 434 (7th Cir. 1986);
cf. Shearson v. DHS, 638 F.3d at 503 (holding that agency may not claim
exemption from (g) civil remedies unless “the underlying substantive duty
is exemptible,” and questioning “whether [the agency’s] efforts to exempt
the system of records from § 552a(g) were procedurally adequate” because
“[t]he agency’s stated justification for exempting the [system of records]
from § 552a(g) is ambiguous regarding the extent to which the rule exempts
the [system of records] from the civil-remedies provision”).
The Federal Bureau of Prisons has claimed the subsection (j)(2) exemption, among
others, for many of its systems of records.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons has promulgated rules exempting a number
of its systems of records – among them, notably, the Inmate Central Records
System – from various subsections of the Act, including (d), (e)(5), and (g).
See 28 C.F.R. § 16.97 (2012). Among the most frequently litigated Privacy
Act claims are those brought by federal inmates against BOP based on one
or more allegedly inaccurate records. In a typical case, an inmate sues BOP
seeking amendment of or damages arising out of an allegedly inaccurate
record contained in a BOP system of records – usually the Inmate Central
Records System. Courts have consistently dismissed these claims on the

As discussed in detail above under subsection “5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(5) Maintain Accurate, Relevant, Timely, and Complete Records” of this
Overview, it was not until 2002 that the BOP exempted many of its systems
of records, including the Inmate Central Records System, from subsection
(e)(5) pursuant to subsection (j)(2). See 28 C.F.R. § 16.97(j) (codifying 67 Fed.
Reg. 51,754 (Aug. 9, 2002)). Thus, inmates’ subsection (e)(5)/(g)(1)(C) claims
[352]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

arising subsequent to August 9, 2002, should not succeed. See, e.g., Fisher v.
BOP, No. 06-5088, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 5140, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 1, 2007)
(per curiam).
Information that is exempt under subsection (j)(2) remains exempt, even if it is
recompiled into a non-law enforcement record, so long as the purpose for which the
agency claimed the subsection (j)(2) exemption remains.
Another important issue arises when information originally compiled for
law enforcement purposes is recompiled into a non-law enforcement record.
The D.C. Circuit confronted this issue in Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d 1346 (D.C. Cir.
1991), and applied the principles of a Supreme Court FOIA decision
concerning recompilation, FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982), to Privacy
Act-protected records. It held that “information contained in a document
qualifying for subsection (j) or (k) exemption as a law enforcement record
does not lose its exempt status when recompiled in a non-law enforcement
record if the purposes underlying the exemption of the original document
pertain to the recompilation as well.” Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d at 1356.
Consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Abramson, the D.C.
Circuit determined that recompilation does not change the basic “nature” of
the information. Id.; accord OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,971,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75 (“The public policy which
dictates the need for exempting records . . . is based on the need to protect
the contents of the records in the system – not the location of the records.
Consequently, in responding to a request for access where documents of
another agency are involved, the agency receiving the request should
consult the originating agency to determine if the records in question have
been exempted.”). By the same token, law enforcement files recompiled into
another agency’s law enforcement files may retain the exemption of the
prior agency’s system of records. See Dupre v. FBI, No. 01-2431, 2002 WL
1042073, at *2 n.2 (E.D. La. May 22, 2002) (finding that Suspicious Activity
Report maintained in exempt Department of the Treasury system of records
remained exempt under that system of records when transferred to FBI for
law enforcement purposes).
For subsection (g)(1)(B) access claims, courts have held that an agency can
promulgate an exemption even after the date an individual makes a Privacy Act
request; agencies need not raise the exemption in administrative proceedings before
raising it in court.
In the context of a subsection (g)(1)(B) access claim, the District Court for the
Northern District of California has ruled that an agency “is entitled to rely
[353]

U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

on exemptions promulgated after the dates on which [the plaintiff] made his
Privacy Act requests.” Hasbrouck v. Customs & Border Prot., No. C 103793, 2012 WL 177563, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2012) (“‘[R]etroactivity’
simply is not implicated, because plaintiff’s claim in essence seeks
prospective injunctive relief – an order requiring CBP to turn over
information now. As such, this is one of the many circumstances in which ‘a
court should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,’
notwithstanding the happenstance that [plaintiff] made his Privacy Act
requests before the current exemptions were promulgated.”).
Finally, note that in the context of a subsection (g)(1)(B) claim for access to
records, some courts have recognized that “there is no requirement that an
agency administratively invoke an exemption in order to later rely on it in
federal court.” Barnard v. DHS, 598 F. Supp. 2d 1, 24 (D.D.C. 2009); see also,
e.g., Cuban v. SEC, 744 F. Supp. 2d 60, 89-90 (D.D.C. 2010).

5 U.S.C. § 552a(k) - Seven Specific Exemption Rules Agencies May Promulgate
“The head of any agency may promulgate rules, in accordance with the
requirements (including general notice) of sections 553(b)(1), (2), and (3), (c), and
(e) of this title, to exempt any system of records within the agency from
subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) and (f) of this section if the
system of records is –
[The seven specific exemptions are discussed in order below.]
At the time rules are adopted under this subsection, the agency shall include in
the statement required under section 553(c) of this title, the reasons why the
system of records is to be exempted from a provision of this section.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(k).
Comment:
Subsection (k) permits agencies to publish rules exempting certain systems of records
from specific Privacy Act provisions.
As noted above, subsection (g)(3)(A) grants courts considering access claims the
authority to “examine the contents of any agency records in camera to determine
whether the records or any portion thereof may be withheld under any of the
exemptions set forth in subsection (k) of this section.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(3)(A).
Further, some courts have held that reasonable segregation of protected and
unprotected information is required under the Act whenever a subsection (k)
[354]

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

exemption is invoked so that the requested information can be disclosed without
disclosing information that must be withheld. See, e.g., May v. Air Force, 777
F.2d 1012, 1015-17 (5th Cir. 1985) (concluding that concerns about releasing
information about identity of source could “could be easily remedied” by typing
document, putting it in third-party’s handwriting, or amalgamating information
into one report); Nemetz v. Treasury, 446 F. Supp. 102, 105 (N.D. Ill. 1978).
The District Court for the District of Columbia has rejected the argument that an
agency failed to comply with subsection (k) because the agency’s statement of
reasons for exempting the system of records “appears only in the Federal
Register, and not in the Code of Federal Regulations where the rule was
eventually codified.” Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr. v. HHS, 849 F. Supp. 2d 13, 23
(D.D.C. 2012). The court first pointed out that “[s]ubsection (k)(2) requires only
that an agency’s rule exempting investigative material comply with the
Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement that ‘the agency shall incorporate in
the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.’” Id.
(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 553(c)). The court concluded that “§ 553(c) is satisfied when a
statement of the rule’s basis and purpose is included in the preamble to the Final
Rule appearing in the Federal Register.” Id.

5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(1) - FOIA Exemption 1, Classified Information
“The head of any agency may promulgate rules, in accordance with the
requirements (including general notice) . . . to exempt any system of records
. . . if the system of records is –
(1) subject to the provisions of section 552(b)(1) of this title.” 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(k)(1).
Comment:
Subsection (k)(1) exempts classified information from certain Privacy Act
provisions.
Subsection (k)(1) simply incorporates FOIA Exemption 1, which exempts
classified information from disclosure. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1); Taylor v.
NSA, 618 F. App’x 478, 482 (11th Cir. 2015); Mobley v. CIA, 924 F. Supp. 2d

28,972, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75.
The exemption has been construed to permit the withholding of classified
records from an agency employee with a security clearance who seeks only
private access to records about himself. See Martens v. Commerce, No. 883334, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10351, at *10-11 (D.D.C. Aug. 6, 1990) (the
exemption is “based on the nature of the material, not the nature of the
individual requester.”).
When responding to a request for access to records covered by this
exemption, an agency may refuse to admit or deny the existence of
responsive intelligence information, known as a “Glomar response,” and is
not required to redact and disclose allegedly non-secret, non-exempt
portions of classified documents. See Willis v. NSA, No. 17-cv-2038 (KBJ),
2019 WL 1924249 (D.D.C April 30, 2019) (“[T]his Court concludes that NSA’s
Glomar response . . . is logically and plausibly rooted in national security
concerns regarding the revelation of classified information . . . and,
therefore, to the extent that Willis’s request sought NSA intelligence
information about herself, NSA’s response does not violate the FOIA or the
Privacy Act.”); Taylor v. NSA, 618 Fed. Appx. at 481-82; Office of Capital
Collateral Counsel ex rel. Mordenti v. DOJ, 331 F.3d 799, 801 n. 3 (11th Cir.
2003) (citing Phillipi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1008 (D.C. Cir. 1976) and finding that
“[a] Glomar response neither confirms nor denies the existence of
documents sought in the FOIA request. This term has its origin in a case
involving a FOIA request for information on the GLOMAR EXPLORER
submarine-retrieval ship.”).

than material within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of this section: Provided,

material shall be provided to such individual, except to the extent that the
disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who
furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the
identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective
date of this section [September 27, 1975], under an implied promise that the
identity of the source would be held in confidence. . .” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(2).
Comment:
This exemption covers: (1) material compiled for criminal investigative law
enforcement purposes, by nonprincipal function criminal law enforcement
entities; and (2) material compiled for other investigative law enforcement
purposes, by any agency.
The material must be compiled for some investigative “law enforcement”
purpose, such as a civil investigation or a criminal investigation by a
nonprincipal function criminal law enforcement agency. See OMB 1975

records compiled for purposes of Federal Employee Compensation Act
claim were properly exempt based on stated reasons for exemption in
agency’s regulation without discussing whether records were indeed
compiled for investigative law enforcement purposes as is statutorily
required).
In general, the subsection (k)(2) exemption does not apply to routine background
security investigation files, but does apply to investigations of employees suspected
of illegal activity.
In general, subsection (k)(2) does not include material compiled solely for
the purpose of a routine background security investigation of a job
applicant. See Vymetalik v. FBI, 785 F.2d 1090, 1093-98 (D.C. Cir. 1986)
(noting applicability of narrower subsection (k)(5) to such material and
ruling that “specific allegations of illegal activities” must be involved in
order for subsection (k)(2) to apply); Bostic v. FBI, No. 1:94 CV 71, slip op. at
7-8 (W.D. Mich. Dec. 16, 1994) (following Vymetalik). The exemption of
material compiled for employment or classified access that would identify a
confidential source is addressed in subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act
(discussed infra).
However, material compiled for the purpose of investigating agency
employees for suspected violations of law can fall within subsection (k)(2).
See Strang v. U.S. Arms Control & Disarmament Agency, 864 F.2d 859, 86263 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (“Unlike Vymetalik, this case involves not a job
applicant undergoing a routine check of his background and his ability to
perform the job, but an existing agency employee investigated for violating
national security regulations.”); Nazimuddin v. IRS, No. 99-2476, 2001 WL

5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(2)” where “original purpose of the investigation . . . was a
complaint to the [Inspector General] of fraud, waste and abuse,” even
though “complaint was not sustained and no criminal charges were
brought,” because “plain language of the exemption states that it applies to
the purpose of the investigation, not to the result”); Mittleman v. Treasury,

Notwithstanding the general rule stated in Vymetalik, a few courts have
found that an agency may rely on subsection (k)(2) to withhold materials
from pre-employment background security investigation files. For example,
in Doe v. DOJ, 790 F. Supp. 17, 19-21 (D.D.C. 1992), the court determined
that, although subsection (k)(5) was “directly applicable,” subsection (k)(2)
also applied to records of an FBI background check on a prospective
Department of Justice attorney. It determined that the Department of
Justice, as “the nation’s primary law enforcement and security agency,” had
a legitimate law enforcement purpose in ensuring that “officials like Doe . . .

be ‘reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete
and unswerving loyalty to the United States.’” Id. at 20 (quoting Exec. Order
No. 10,450, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489 (Apr. 29, 1953)). Likewise, in Cohen v. FBI,
No. 93-1701 (D.D.C. Oct. 3, 1995), the court found subsection (k)(2) to be
applicable to one document in a prospective employee’s background
investigation file because that document was “withheld out of a legitimate
concern for national security” and it “satisfie[d] the standards set forth in
Vymetalik,” which recognized that “‘[i]f specific allegations of illegal
activities were involved, then th[e] investigation might well be characterized
as a law enforcement investigation’” and that “‘[s]o long as the investigation
was “realistically based on a legitimate concern that federal laws have been
or may be violated or that national security may be breached” the records
may be considered law enforcement records.’” Cohen, No. 93-1701, slip op.
at 3-6 (D.D.C. Oct. 3, 1995) (quoting Vymetalik, 785 F.2d at 1098, in turn
quoting Pratt, 673 F.2d at 421).
Similarly, subsection (k)(2) has been held in at least one case to apply to
background investigations of prospective FBI/DEA special agents. See
Putnam v. DOJ, 873 F. Supp. 705, 717 (D.D.C. 1995) (finding that subsection
(k)(2) was properly invoked to withhold information that would reveal
identities of individuals who provided information in connection with
former FBI special agent’s pre-employment investigation).
Individuals are entitled to access investigative records used as a basis for denying
their rights, privileges, or benefits.
Although the issue has not been the subject of much significant case law, the
OMB 1975 Guidelines explain that the “Provided, however” provision of
subsection (k)(2) means that “[t]o the extent that such an investigatory
record is used as a basis for denying an individual any right, privilege, or
benefit to which the individual would be entitled in the absence of that
record, the individual must be granted access to that record except to the
extent that access would reveal the identity of a confidential source.” 40

of confidentiality pursuant to subsection (k)(2) without discussion of
whether investigatory record was used to deny right, privilege, or benefit);
Guccione v. Nat’l Indian Gaming Comm’n, No. 98-CV-164, 1999 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 15475, at *11-12 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 5, 1999) (approving agency invocation
of subsection (k)(2) to protect third-party names of individuals who had not
been given express promises of confidentiality where plaintiff did not
contend any denial of right, privilege, or benefit).
The District Court for the District of Colorado has found that forced early
retirement resulted in a loss of a benefit, right, or privilege for purposes of the
subsection (k)(2) exemption.
A few decisions have discussed what constitutes a denial of a “right,
privilege, or benefit” sufficient to require that the agency grant access to
records otherwise exempt from access under subsection (k)(2). For example,
in Viotti v. Air Force, 902 F. Supp. at 1335-36, the District Court for the
District of Colorado determined that an Air Force Colonel’s forced early
retirement “resulted in a loss of a benefit, right or privilege for which he was
eligible – the loss of six months to four years of the difference between his
active duty pay and retirement pay,” and “over his life expectancy . . . the
difference in pay between the amount of his retirement pay for twenty-six
years of active duty versus thirty years of active duty.” Id. The court found
that “as a matter of law, based on [a report of inquiry, plaintiff] lost benefits,
rights, and privileges for which he was eligible” and thus he was entitled to
an unredacted copy of the report “despite the fact that [it] was prepared
pursuant to a law enforcement investigation.” Id. It went on to find that
“the ‘express’ promise requirement” of (k)(2) was not satisfied where a
witness “merely expressed a ‘fear of reprisal.’” Id. (citing Londrigan v. FBI,
670 F.2d 1164, 1170 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (Londrigan I).
The District Court for the District of Oregon has found that that depriving an
individual of the right to be present at, and seek medical services from, a health
system facility resulted in a loss of a benefit, right, or privilege for purposes of the
subsection (k)(2) exemption.
Likewise, the District Court for the District of Oregon held that subsection
(k)(2) required access to interview notes compiled by the Office for Civil
Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services in the course of its
investigation of a discrimination complaint filed by the plaintiff against a
health system. Menchu, 965 F. Supp. 2d at 1248. The notes concerned
accusations made by an employee of the health system that the plaintiff had

harassed her, which led the health system to bar the plaintiff from its
facilities. Id. at 1241. The agency denied the plaintiff’s discrimination claim,
upholding the health system’s decision to bar the plaintiff from its facilities.
Id. at 1249. In rejecting the agency’s argument that its regulations – which
were promulgated pursuant to subsection (k)(2) and which purported to
exempt the notes from the Act’s access provisions – permitted it to withhold
the notes, the Court reasoned that “the records created by the Agency
during the investigation, and the continued maintenance of such material,
deprived [the plaintiff] of ‘a right, privilege, or benefit that he would
otherwise be entitled by Federal law’ – the right to be present on, pursue
employment at, and seek medical services from, [the health system’s]
facilities in a nondiscriminatory manner.” Id.
A number of courts have found that plaintiffs have failed to articulate a deprivation
of a right or benefit in accordance with the subsection (k)(2) exemption.
In contrast, the District Court for the District of Columbia found no
deprivation of rights or benefits that would require granting access to
subsection (k)(2) records. Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr. v. HHS, 849 F. Supp. 2d
13, 24 (D.D.C. 2012). The plaintiffs in Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr. claimed to
have suffered adverse employment actions as the result of the Office of
Inspector General’s maintenance of certain investigative records to which
they sought access. Id. The OIG disputed that any employment actions
“occurred as a result of the maintenance” of its investigative file, especially
as the results of its investigation found no misconduct. Id. The OIG
maintained that any action taken by the FDA against plaintiffs “was at
FDA’s discretion.” Id. The court agreed, stating: “In sum, OIG’s
maintenance of its investigative files did not cause Plaintiffs to be denied
rights or benefits; instead, FDA’s maintenance of its own investigative files
resulted in any adverse employment actions suffered by Plaintiffs.” Id. See
also, e.g., Gowan v. Air Force, 148 F.3d at 1189 (finding that individual was
not entitled to access Inspector General complaint protected by subsection
(k)(2), because “the charges in the complaint were deemed unworthy of
further action”).
In Doe v. DOJ, 790 F. Supp. at 21 n.4, 22, the court determined that the
disclosure requirement in subsection (k)(2) did not apply, on grounds that
the plaintiff “ha[d] no entitlement to a job with the Justice Department.”
The court, however, failed to discuss whether the denial of a federal job
would amount to the denial of a “privilege” or “benefit.” See also Jaindl,
No. 90-1489, slip op. at 2 n.1 (noting that “[b]ecause there is no general right
to possess a passport,” application of (k)(2) was not limited in that case).

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

The limited right of access under the subsection (k)(2) exemption does not include
the right to amend.
Even when applicable, the limited right to obtain access to records protected
under subsection (k)(2) does not include the right to have such records
amended. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(2) (requiring only that “material shall be
provided to [the] individual except to the extent that disclosure of such
material would reveal the identity of a [confidential source]” (emphasis
added)). For example, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in
affirming Viotti, supra, noted that subsection (k)(2)’s limiting exception
applied only in the context of access requests and did not apply to limit the
exemption’s applicability with regard to amendment requests. Viotti v. Air
Force, 153 F.3d at 2 n.2; see also Gowan, 148 F.3d at 1189 (concluding that
subsection (k)(2) did not require disclosure of the record to the subject
individual, while separately observing that the record remained exempt
from amendment under that subsection).
The Privacy Act does not impose a temporal limitation on the applicability of the
subsection (k)(2) exemption.
Unlike with Exemption 7(A) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.
§ 552(b)(7)(A) (2018), there is no temporal limitation on the scope of
subsection (k)(2). See Irons v. Bell, 596 F.2d 468, 471 (1st Cir. 1979); Lobosco,
1981 WL 1780, at *4. But see Anderson v. Treasury, No. 76-1404, slip op. at
9-11 (D.D.C. July 19, 1977) (finding subsection (k)(2) inapplicable to
investigatory report regarding alleged wrongdoing by IRS agent where
investigation was closed and no possibility of any future law enforcement
proceedings existed).
Records exempted under the subsection (k)(2) exemption should still be exempt if
the records are subsequently added into non-law enforcement records.
Information that originally qualifies for subsection (k)(2) protection should
retain that protection even if it subsequently is recompiled into a non-law
enforcement record. See Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d 1346, 1356 (D.C. Cir. 1991)

Suits alleging an agency’s wrongful disclosure of records pursuant to a promise of
confidentiality in accordance with the subsection (k)(2) exemption are unusual and
have not prevailed.
Finally, two courts have ruled in favor of the agency in cases brought by
individuals who allegedly provided information pursuant to a promise of
confidentiality and sought damages resulting from disclosure of the
information and failure to sufficiently protect their identities pursuant to
subsection (k)(2). Bechhoefer v. DOJ, 934 F. Supp. 535, 538-39 (W.D.N.Y.
1996), vacated & remanded, 209 F.3d 57 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding that
information at issue did qualify as “record” under Privacy Act); Sterling v.
United States, 798 F. Supp. 47, 49 (D.D.C. 1992). In Sterling, the District
Court for the District of Columbia stated that the plaintiff was “not barred
from stating a claim for monetary damages [under (g)(1)(D)] merely because
the record did not contain ‘personal information’ about him and was not
retrieved through a search of indices bearing his name or other identifying
characteristics,” 798 F. Supp. at 49, but in a subsequent opinion the court
ultimately ruled in favor of the agency, having been presented with no
evidence that the agency had intentionally or willfully disclosed the
plaintiff’s identity. Sterling v. United States, 826 F. Supp. 570, 571-72
(D.D.C. 1993), summary affirmance granted, No. 93-5264 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 11,
1994). However, the District Court for the Western District of New York in
Bechhoefer, when presented with an argument based on Sterling, stated that
it did not “find the Sterling court’s analysis persuasive.” Bechhoefer, 934 F.
Supp. at 538-39. Having already determined that the information at issue
did not qualify as a record “about” the plaintiff, that court recognized that
subsection (k)(2) “does not prohibit agencies from releasing material that
would reveal the identity of a confidential source” but rather “allows
agencies to promulgate rules to exempt certain types of documents from
mandatory disclosure under other portions of the Act.” Id. The court went
on to state that “plaintiff’s reliance on § 552a(k)(2) [wa]s misplaced,” and
that subsection (k) was “irrelevant” to the claim before it for wrongful
disclosure. Id. at 539.

Comment:
Known as the “Erlenborn Amendment,” the subsection (k)(5) exemption is
generally applicable to source-identifying materials in background employment and
personnel-type investigative files.
This exemption is generally applicable to source-identifying material in
background employment and personnel-type investigative files. See OMB
1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,973-74, https://www.justice.gov/
paoverview_omb-75; 120 Cong. Rec. at 40,884-85, reprinted in Source Book
at 860, 996-97, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook. The
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that
exemption (k)(5) is also applicable to source-identifying material compiled
for determining eligibility for federal grants, stating that “the term ‘Federal
contracts’ in Privacy Act exemption (k)(5) encompasses a federal grant
agreement if the grant agreement includes the essential elements of a
contract and establishes a contractual relationship between the government
and the grantee.” Henke v. Commerce, 83 F.3d 1445, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1996).
In addition, exemption (k)(5) is applicable to information collected for
continued as well as original employment. See Hernandez v. Alexander,
671 F.2d 402, 406 (10th Cir. 1982). In situations where “specific allegations of
illegal activities” are being investigated, an agency may be able to invoke
subsection (k)(2) – which is potentially broader in its coverage than
subsection (k)(5). See, e.g., Vymetalik v. FBI, 785 at 1093-98.
Subsection (k)(5) – known as the “Erlenborn Amendment” – was among the
most hotly debated of any of the Act’s provisions because it provides for
absolute protection to those who qualify as confidential sources, regardless
of the adverse effect that the material they provide may have on an
individual. See 120 Cong. Rec. at 36,655-58, reprinted in Source Book at 90819, https://www.justice.gov/opcl/paoverview_sourcebook.
However, an agency cannot rely upon subsection (k)(5) to bar a requester’s
amendment request, as the exemption applies only to the extent that
disclosure of information would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
See Vymetalik, 785 F.2d at 1096-98; see also Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d at 1356 n.12
(noting that subsection (k)(5) would not apply where FBI refused to amend
information that had already been disclosed to individual seeking
amendment); Bostic, No. 1:94 CV 71, slip op. at 9 (W.D. Mich. Dec. 16, 1994)
(holding that application of exemption (k)(5) in this access case is not
contrary to, but rather consistent with, Vymetalik and Doe v. FBI because in
those cases exemption (k)(5) did not apply because relief sought was

amendment of records).
It should be noted that information that originally qualifies for subsection
(k)(5) protection should retain that protection even if it subsequently is
recompiled into a non-law enforcement record. See Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d
1346, 1356 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (discussing under subsection (j)(2)); accord OMB
1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,971, https://www.justice.gov/paoverview
_omb-75.
Subsection (k)(5) is a narrow exemption, requiring an expressed promise of
confidentiality after the effective date of the Privacy Act, and is limited to sourceidentifying material.
Even so, subsection (k)(5) is a narrow exemption in two respects. First, in
contrast to Exemption 7(D) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D) (2018), it
requires an express promise of confidentiality for source material acquired
after the effective date of the Privacy Act (September 27, 1975). See, e.g.,
Lamb v. Millennium Challenge Corp., 334 F.3d 204, 218 (D.D.C. 2018)
(concluding that further information was needed to determine whether
subsection (k)(5) applied, including whether promise of confidentiality was
implied or “express,” as required by the subsection); Viotti v. Air Force, 902
F. Supp. at 1336 (finding that “‘express’ promise requirement” of subsection
(k)(2) was not satisfied when witness “merely expressed a ‘fear of
reprisal’”), aff’d, 153 F.3d 730 (10th Cir. 1998) (unpublished table decision).
For source material acquired prior to the effective date of the Privacy Act, an
implied promise of confidentiality will suffice. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(5); cf.
Londrigan v. FBI, 722 F.2d 840, 844-45 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Londrigan II)
(finding no “automatic exemption” for FBI background interviews prior to
effective date of Privacy Act; inferring that interviewees were impliedly
promised confidentiality where FBI showed that it had pursued “policy of
confidentiality” to which interviewing agents conformed their conduct). See
generally DOJ v. Landano, 508 U.S. 165 (1993) (setting standards for
demonstrating implied confidentiality under FOIA Exemption 7(D)).
Second, in contrast to the second clause of FOIA Exemption 7(D), subsection
(k)(5) protects only source-identifying material, not all source-supplied
material.
Of course, where source-identifying material is exempt from Privacy Act
access under subsection (k)(5), it typically is exempt under the broader
exemptions of the FOIA as well. See, e.g., Keenan v. DOJ, No. 94-1909, slip
op. at 16-17 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 1997), subsequent decision, slip op. at 5-7

532 F. Supp. 216, 232 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), aff’d, 707 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1983).
One court has held that subsection (k)(5) protects source-identifying
material even where the identity of the source is known. See Volz v. DOJ,
619 F.2d 49, 50 (10th Cir. 1980). Another court has suggested to the contrary.
Doe v. U.S. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 483 F. Supp. 539, 576-77 (S.D.N.Y. 1980)
(holding the addresses of three named persons “not exempt from disclosure
under (k)(5) . . . because they didn’t serve as confidential sources and the
plaintiff already knows their identity”).
Subsection (k)(5) is not limited to those sources who provide derogatory
comments, see Londrigan I, 670 F.2d at 1170; see also Voelker v. FBI, 638 F.
Supp. 571, 572-73 (E.D. Mo. 1986). The exemption is not limited to
information that would reveal the identity of the source in statements made
by those confidential sources, but also protects information that would
reveal the source’s identity in statements provided by third parties. See
Haddon v. Freeh, 31 F. Supp. 2d 16, 21 (D.D.C. 1998). Also, the exemption’s
applicability is not diminished by the age of the source-identifying material.
See Diamond, 532 F. Supp. at 232-33.
Promises of confidentiality should not be automatic, and courts have suggested that
agencies utilize the promise of confidentiality sparingly.
OMB’s policy guidance indicates that promises of confidentiality are not to
be made automatically. OMB 1975 Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. at 28,974,
https://www.justice.gov/paoverview_omb-75. Consistent with the OMB
1975 Guidelines, the Office of Personnel Management has promulgated
regulations establishing procedures for determining when a pledge of
confidentiality is appropriate. See 5 C.F.R. § 736.102 (2012); see also Larry v.
Lawler, 605 F.2d 954, 961 n.8 (7th Cir. 1978) (suggesting that finding of
“good cause” is prerequisite for granting of confidentiality to sources).
Nevertheless, the District Court for the District of Columbia has held that in
order to invoke exemption (k)(5) for sources that were in fact promised
confidentiality, it is not necessary that the sources themselves affirmatively
sought confidentiality, nor must the government make a showing that the
sources would not have furnished information without a promise of
confidentiality. Henke v. Commerce, No. 94-0189, 1996 WL 692020, at *9-10
[369]

(D.D.C. Aug. 19, 1994). The court went on to state: “[T]he question of
whether the reviewers expressed a desire to keep their identities
confidential is wholly irrelevant to the Court’s determination of whether
they were in fact given promises of confidentiality.” Id. at *10. On appeal,
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated that while it
“would not go quite that far,” as agencies “must use subsection (k)(5)
sparingly,” agencies may make determinations that promises of
confidentiality are necessary “categorically,” as “[n]othing in either the
statute or the case law requires that [an agency] apply subsection (k)(5) only
to those particular reviewers who have expressly asked for an exemption
and would otherwise have declined to participate in the peer review
process.” Henke v. Commerce, 83 F.3d at 1449.

5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(6) - Testing or Examination Materials
“The head of any agency may promulgate rules, in accordance with the
requirements (including general notice) . . . to exempt any system of records
. . . if the system of records is –
...
(6) testing or examination material used solely to determine individual
qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service the
disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the
testing or examination process.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(6).
Comment:
Courts generally have found that FOIA Exemption 2 reflects the same concerns and
covers the same information as the testing and examination material exemption.
Material exempt from Privacy Act access under subsection (k)(6) is also
typically exempt from FOIA access under FOIA Exemption 2 (exempting
records “related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the
agency”). See Kelly v. Census Bureau, No. C 10-04507, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

(k)(6), and further, noting that although court did not need to address
agency’s FOIA Exemption 2 argument “[i]n light of the Court’s finding that
the information fits under another FOIA exemption,” FOIA Exemption 2
“has been read to reflect the same concerns and cover the same information
as the exemption codified in Section 552a(k)(6)”).
The Ninth Circuit has found that the testing and examination material exemption
applies to the agency’s test or examination, the minimum passing score, and the
individual test scores.
Subsection (k)(6) applies not only to an agency’s test or examination, but
also to the minimum passing score and individual test scores. See Rojas v.
FAA, 941 F.3d 392, 403 (9th Cir. 2019) (holding that term “testing material”
refers to “items needed to conduct a test or examination to determine an
individual’s proficiency or knowledge”), aff’g in relevant part Rojas v. FAA,

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

DISCLOSURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
“(a)(1) It shall be unlawful for any Federal, State or local government agency to deny
to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such
individual’s refusal to disclose his social security account number.
(2) the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to—
(A) any disclosure which is required by Federal statute, or
(B) the disclosure of a social security number to any Federal, State, or local
agency maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before
January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation
adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual.
(b) Any Federal, State, or local government agency which requests an individual to
disclose his social security account number shall inform that individual whether that
disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority such
number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it.” Section 7 of the Privacy Act of
1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. § 552a note (Disclosure of Social Security Number).
Comment:
Section 7 was passed into law as part of the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93–579,
88 Stat 1896. Unlike section 3 of the Privacy Act, however, which Congress
designated as an amendment to Title V of the United States Code, Congress made no
such statement about section 7. Thus, the reviser of the United States Code placed
section 7 in a “Historical and Statutory” note following section 552a. See 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a (note). The fact that section 7 was never codified and appears only in the
“Historical and Statutory Notes” section of the United States Code, does not diminish
its weight, however: “The reverse is true: ‘the Code cannot prevail over the Statutes
at Large when the two are inconsistent.’” Schwier v. Cox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th
Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Welden, 377 U.S. 95 (1964) (internal quotations
omitted)). Therefore, section 7 carries the force of law.
To constitute a violation of section 7, an agency must not only request that an
individual disclose a social security number, but also deny a “right, benefit, or
privilege” to that individual because of the individual’s refusal to disclose the social
security number. See, e.g., El-Bey v. N.C. Bd. of Nursing, No. 1:09CV753, 2009 WL
5220166, at *2 (M.D.N.C. Dec. 31, 2009) (dismissing plaintiff’s “Privacy Act/Social
Security Act claim” because “Plaintiff alleges only that Defendants requested his
number, not that they denied him a legal right based on its non-disclosure so as to

potentially violate the Privacy Act”); Johnson v. Fleming, No. 95 Civ. 1891, 1996 WL
502410, at *1, 3-4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 1996) (finding no violation of section 7(b) notice
requirement or section 7(a)(1) because plaintiff did not establish that police officer
denied a “right, benefit, or privilege” when plaintiff refused to provide police officer
with his social security number).
Although this provision applies beyond federal agencies, it does not apply to: (1) any
disclosure which is required by federal statute; or (2) any disclosure of a social
security number to any federal, state, or local agency maintaining a system of records
in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required
under statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an
individual. See Sec. 7(a)(2)(A)-(B).
A. Exception for Disclosures Required by Federal Statute
Federal, state, and local agencies may deny an individual a right, benefit, or privilege
provided by law because of such individual’s refusal to disclose the individual’s social
security number if the disclosure is required by federal statute.
A key statute that requires the disclosure of social security numbers is the Social
Security Act (SSA), which expressly permits a state agency to use social security
numbers for the purpose of identifying individuals “in the administration of any
tax, general public assistance, driver’s license, or motor vehicle registration law
within its jurisdiction,” see 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C)(i) (2018). The SSA also
permits a state agency to use social security numbers to issue birth certificates
and to enforce child support orders, the Secretary of Agriculture to use social
security numbers in administering the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, and the
Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to use them in administering the Federal
Crop Insurance Act. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(c)(2)(C)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv).
Several courts have interpreted subsection 7(a)(2)(A) as creating an exception to
the general requirement that an individual cannot be denied a benefit for failure
to disclose a social security number. See Tankersley v. Almand, 837 F.3d 390,
398-399 (4th Cir. 2016) (holding that the Tax Reform Act, 42 U.S.C.
§ 405(c)(2)(C)(i), which authorizes states to require an individual “who is or
appears to be [affected by the administration of any tax law within its
jurisdiction]” to disclose the individual’s social security number, permitted
Maryland to compel plaintiff to provide his social security number to the Client
Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland “on pain of suspension of his law
license.”); Peterson v. City of Detroit, 76 F. App’x 601, 602 (6th Cir. 2003)

subsequent amendment to the Social Security Act”); Stoianoff v. Comm’r of the
DMV, 12 F. App’x 33, 35 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding that plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim
would fail because 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C)(i) “expressly authorizes states to

this section is ‘null, void, and of no effect’”); McElrath v. Califano, 615 F.2d 434,

and the notice requirements therefore not triggered; rather, because disclosure of
social security number is required by statute, “the [U.S. Trustee] is enforcing a
Congressional directive, not ‘requesting’ anyone’s SSN” and “[t]he clerk receives

“requires placing the SSN upon ‘documents for filing’”).
B.

Exception for Laws and Regulations in Effect before January 1, 1975
Federal, state, and local agencies may deny an individual a right, benefit, or privilege
provided by law because of such individual’s refusal to disclose the individual’s social
security number if required under statute or regulation adopted prior to January 1, 1975,
and used to verify the identity of an individual.
A second exception to the general provisions of section 7 is set out in subsection
7(a)(2)(B), which grandfathers statutes or regulations in effect before January 1,
1975, and provides that the prohibition on denying a benefit because of an
individual’s failure to provide a social security number does not apply to those
statutes and regulations. See Schwier v. Cox, 439 F.3d 1285, 1285-86 (11th Cir.
2006) (holding that section 7(a)(2)(B) grandfather exception did not apply to
Georgia voter registration procedures), aff’g 412 F. Supp. 2d 1266 (N.D. Ga.
2005), remanded by 340 F.3d at 1288-89 (explaining that although section 7 is
uncodified, it is still present in the Statutes at Large and therefore is not “a dead
letter”); McKay v. Thompson, 226 F.3d 752, 755 (6th Cir. 2000) (finding that
Tennessee law requiring disclosure of social security number for voter
registration fell within section 7(a)(2)’s exception for systems of records in
existence prior to January 1, 1975, where disclosure was required under statute
or regulation).

C.

Federal, State, and Local Government Notice Requirements
Subsection 7(b) specifies the notice that Federal, State, and local agencies are required to
give when requesting individuals’ social security numbers.
Pursuant to subsection 7(b), an agency that requests that individuals disclose
their social security numbers must notify individuals whether the disclosure is
mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority such number is
solicited, and what uses will be made of it. See Crawford v. U.S. Trustee, 194
F.3d 954, 961-62 (9th Cir. 1999) (rejecting government’s argument that because
disclosure of plaintiff’s social security number was expressly required by federal
statute, section 7 was wholly inapplicable, stating that “§ 7(a)(2)(A)’s exclusion
for federal statutes only pertains to the limitation recited in § 7(a)(1),” and
holding that section 7(b) notice requirements had “no bearing on the public
disclosure of [plaintiff’s] social security number[] by the government,” which
was only issue in dispute); Alcaraz v. Block, 746 F.2d 593, 608-09 (9th Cir. 1984)

D. Causes of Action
Courts have split over whether section 7 provides a cause of action against agencies and,
if it does, whether that action is limited to federal agencies.
Jurisdiction to enforce the social security number provision might appear
questionable inasmuch as the Privacy Act does not expressly provide for a civil
remedy against a nonfederal agency, or for injunctive relief outside of the access
and amendment contexts. Courts of appeals in the Sixth and Ninth Circuit have
held that section 7 of the Privacy Act applies exclusively to federal agencies and
does not provide for causes of action against state and local entities. See Schmitt
v. City of Detroit, 395 F.3d 327, 330-31 (6th Cir. 2005) (noting that it was
“confronted by two provisions of the Privacy Act that contradict one another to
some degree: the statutory definition, which unambiguously contemplates that
the Privacy Act applies exclusively to federal agencies, and § 7(b), which by its
terms includes state and local agencies within its ambit,” but after looking to
legislative history, ultimately holding that Privacy Act applies only to federal
agencies); Dittman v. Cal., 191 F.3d 1020, 1026 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that
Privacy Act provides no cause of action against a state licensing entity inasmuch
as the private right of civil action created by subsection (g) “is specifically limited
to actions against agencies of the United States Government”); Peterson v.
Michigan, No. 11-12153, 2011 WL 3516030, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 11, 2011)
(denying plaintiff’s motion to reconsider on grounds that § 7 does not apply to
the State of Michigan); Dionicio v. Allison, No. 3:09-cv-00575, 2010 WL 3893816,
at *18 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 30, 2010) (citing Schmitt and granting summary
judgment to defendants, agents of the Tennessee Alcohol & Beverage
Commission who were sued in their individual and official capacities on
grounds that “the civil remedies established by 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g) for violations

v. Cardaris, No. 2:10-CV-437, 2010 WL 3603553, at *3 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 9, 2010)
(also citing Schmitt and finding that while the Privacy Act permits an individual
to bring a civil action for disclosure of a social security number, that action may
only be brought against a federal agency); Warner v. Twp. of S. Harrison, Civ.
No. 09-6095, 2010 WL 3001969, at *4 (D.N.J. July 26, 2010) (dismissing plaintiff’s
section 7(b) claim against Township because “Plaintiff’s real complaint is

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

social security number to the public . . . [which is] not covered by Section 7(b),
but instead by Section 3. . . . Section 3, however, does not apply to state and local
agencies.”); but see Lawson v. Shelby Cnty., Tenn., 211 F.3d 331, 335 (6th Cir.
2000) (holding that “Congress never expressly abrogated state sovereign
immunity under the Privacy Act”; however, permitting plaintiffs’ request for
prospective injunctive relief [to enforce section 7 of the Privacy Act] against
[state] officials” under Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)).
Other courts, including the Seventh and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals,
have reached the opposite conclusion, however, and have held that the remedial
scheme of section 3 of the Privacy Act, which applies strictly to federal agencies,
does not apply to section 7, which by its express terms applies to federal, state,
and local agencies. See Schwier v. Cox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1292 (11th Cir. 2003); see
also Gonzalez v. Vill. of W. Milwaukee, 671 F.3d 649, 661-63 (7th Cir. 2012). In
Schwier, the court concluded that “Congress created an ‘unambiguously
conferred right’ in section 7 of the Privacy Act,” and it reasoned that section 7
may be enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which “provides a private right of
action whenever an individual has been deprived of any constitutional or
statutory federal right under color of state law” as “the remedial scheme of
section 3 provides no basis for concluding that Congress intended to preclude
private remedies under § 1983 for violations of section 7.” Schwier, 340 F.3d at
1289-90, 1292. Following the Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning in Schwier, the
Seventh Circuit in Gonzalez found “no conflict between §§ 3 and 7 [of the
Privacy Act]” as “it seems clear that when § 3(a)(1) defines agencies as federal
agencies ‘for purposes of this section,’ it refers only to § 3 . . . . Accordingly,
there is no need to look beyond the unambiguous text of § 7 to determine its
applicability. By its express terms, § 7 applies to federal, state, and local
agencies.” Gonzalez, 671 F.3d at 662. See also Lanzetta v. Woodmansee, No.
2:13-cv-276, 2013 WL 1610508, at *2 (following Schwier and stating “[a]n
individual may also pursue enforcement of his privacy rights under Section 7 of

*9 (E.D. Va. Sept. 11, 2008) (concluding that “because Section 7 confers a legal
right on individuals and because Congress did not specifically foreclose a

Section 7 are enforceable under § 1983”); Stollenwerk v. Miller, No. 04-5510, 2006

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS
“(1) When an agency provides by a contract for the operation by or on behalf of the
agency of a system of records to accomplish an agency function, the agency shall,
consistent with its authority, cause the requirements of this section to be applied to
such system. For purposes of subsection (i) of this section any such contractor and
any employee of such contractor, if such contract is agreed to on or after the effective
date of this section [Sept. 27, 1995], shall be considered to be an employee of an
agency.
(2) A consumer reporting agency to which a record is disclosed under section 3711(e)
of Title 31 shall not be considered a contractor for the purposes of this section.” 5
U.S.C. § 552a(m)(1)-(2)
Comment:
Generally, subsection (m) extends the requirements of the Privacy Act to contractors
who maintain a system of records to accomplish the agency’s functions. See
generally Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency v. Perez, No. 3:18-CV-1114
(MPS), 2020 WL 2079634, at *12 (D. Conn. Apr. 30, 2020) (citing subsection (m) to
conclude that contractor “had no more right to disclose the documents than an
employee of the [agency] would have had.”); cf. Boggs v. Se. Tidewater Opportunity
Project, No. CIV. A. 2:96CV196, 1996 WL 274381, at *2 (E.D. Va. May 22, 1996)
(finding subsection (m) inapplicable where contractor was community action agency
that was not “in the business of keeping records for federal agencies” as is required
under subsection (m)).
The Federal Acquisition Regulation provides language that must be inserted in
solicitations and contracts “[w]hen the design, development, or operation of a system
of records on individuals is required to accomplish an agency function.” 48 C.F.R.
§ 24.104 (2020); see also id. § 52.224-1 to -2. The regulation defines “operation of a
system of records” as “performance of any of the activities associated with
maintaining the system of records, including the collection, use, and dissemination of
records.” Id. at § 52.224-2(c)(1). But cf. Koch v. Schapiro, 777 F. Supp. 2d 86, 91
(D.D.C. 2011) (concluding, in context of claim brought under Rehabilitation Act, that
“a contract to investigate complaints of discrimination by employees of the agency on
behalf of the [agency’s] EEO Office” is “not a contract for the design or development
of a system of records” and therefore is “not the type of contract covered by 48 C.F.R.
pt. 24”).
Additionally, see the discussion of subsection (b)(1), “Twelve Exceptions to “No
Disclosure without Consent, Conditions Of Disclosure to Third Parties, Need to

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT

Know Within Agency” above, regarding whether contractors are “employees” of an
agency for purposes of disclosing a record in a system of records under that
subsection.
Even when subsection (m) is applicable, the agency – not the contractor – remains the
only proper defendant in a Privacy Act civil lawsuit. See, e.g., Repetto v. Magellan
Health Servs., No. 12-4108, 2013 WL 1176470, at *5-6 (D.N.J. Mar. 19, 2013) (rejecting
plaintiff’s claims that §subsection (m) permits Privacy Act claims against
corporations contracting with government and finding that, had “Congress wanted
government contractors to be subject to suit for violations, it could have included
word ‘remedies’ in § 552a(m). Instead, Congress deliberately ensured that only
agencies were subjects of requirements and remedies, but only extended the Act’s
requirements to the government contractors.”); Patterson v. Austin Med. Ctr., No. 971241, 1998 WL 35276064, at *2 (D. Minn. Jan. 28, 1998) (finding subsection (m) “does
not create a private cause of action against a government contractor for violations of
the Act”), aff’d, 163 F.3d 602 (8th Cir. Sept. 11, 1998) (unpublished table case);
Adelman v. Discover Card Servs., 915 F. Supp. 1163, 1166 (D. Utah 1996) (finding that
“a strict construction of ‘employee of the United States’ cannot include employees of
state agencies administering a federal program,” and also finding that limited waiver
of sovereign immunity afforded by § 552a(g)(1) applies only to federal agencies).
Contra Shannon v. Gen. Elec. Co., 812 F. Supp. 308, 315, n.5 (N.D.N.Y. 1993) (noting
that “[t]here is no dispute that GE is subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act,
inasmuch as it falls within the definition of ‘agency’”).

MAILING LISTS
“An individual’s name and address may not be sold or rented by an agency unless
such action is specifically authorized by law. This provision shall not be construed to
require the withholding of names and addresses otherwise permitted to be made
public.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(n).
Comment:
For a decision discussing this provision, see Disabled Officer’s Ass’n v. Rumsfeld, 428
F. Supp. 454, 459 (D.D.C. 1977), aff’d, 574 F.2d 636 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (unpublished table
decision). In this case, the court ordered the Department of Defense to release names
and addresses of retired disabled officers to the association. The court’s analysis
centered on Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA, but the court also found that subsection (n)
did not apply because the agency was not selling or renting the information, and the
FOIA required disclosure. For a further discussion of this provision, see OMB 1975

“(1) the privacy of an individual is directly affected by the collection,
maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information by Federal
agencies;

while essential to the efficient operations of the Government, has greatly
magnified the harm to individual privacy that can occur from any collection,
maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal information;

credit, and his right to due process, and other legal protections are endangered
by the misuse of certain information systems;

“(4) the right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the
Constitution of the United States; and
“(5) in order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in information
systems maintained by Federal agencies, it is necessary and proper for the
Congress to regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of
information by such agencies.
“(b) The purpose of this Act [enacting this section and provisions set out as notes
under this section] is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an
invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except as otherwise
provided by law, to“(1) permit an individual to determine what records pertaining to him are
collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by such agencies;
“(2) permit an individual to prevent records pertaining to him obtained by such
agencies for a particular purpose from being used or made available for another
purpose without his consent;
“(3) permit an individual to gain access to information pertaining to him in
Federal agency records, to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof, and
to correct or amend such records;
“(4) collect, maintain, use, or disseminate any record of identifiable personal
information in a manner that assures that such action is for a necessary and
lawful purpose, that the information is current and accurate for its intended
use, and that adequate safeguards are provided to prevent misuse of such
information;
“(5) permit exemptions from the requirements with respect to records provided
in this Act only in those cases where there is an important public policy need
for such exemption as has been determined by specific statutory authority; and
“(6) be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a result of willful or
intentional action which violates any individual’s rights under this Act.”

2, Nov. 18, 2008, 73 F.R. 70239, provided:
WHEREAS certain Federal agencies from time to time require in the administration
of their activities a system of numerical identification of accounts of individual
persons; and
WHEREAS some seventy million persons have heretofore been assigned account
numbers pursuant to the Social Security Act; and
WHEREAS a large percentage of Federal employees have already been assigned
account numbers pursuant to the Social Security Act; and
WHEREAS it is desirable in the interest of economy and orderly administration that
the Federal Government move towards the use of a single, unduplicated numerical
identification system of accounts and avoid the unnecessary establishment of
additional systems:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the
United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
1. Hereafter any Federal department, establishment, or agency may, whenever the
head thereof finds it advisable to establish a new system of permanent account
numbers pertaining to individual persons, utilize the Social Security Act account
numbers assigned pursuant to title 20, section 422.103 of the Code of Federal
Regulations and pursuant to paragraph 2 of this order.
2. The Social Security Administration shall provide for the assignment of an account
number to each person who is required by any Federal agency to have such a
number but who has not previously been assigned such number by the
Administration. The Administration may accomplish this purpose by (a) assigning
such numbers to individual persons, (b) assigning blocks of numbers to Federal
agencies for reassignment to individual persons, or (c) making such other
arrangements for the assignment of numbers as it may deem appropriate.
3. The Social Security Administration shall furnish, upon request of any Federal
agency utilizing the numerical identification system of accounts provided for in this
order, the account number pertaining to any person with whom such agency has an
account or the name and other identifying data pertaining to any account number of
any such person.

the availability of appropriations.

or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United
States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers,
employees, or agents, or any other person.
