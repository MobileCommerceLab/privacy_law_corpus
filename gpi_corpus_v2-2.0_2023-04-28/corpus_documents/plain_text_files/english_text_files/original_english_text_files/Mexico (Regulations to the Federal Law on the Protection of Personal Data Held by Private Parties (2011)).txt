structure and design that facilitates its understanding.
Means of Divulging
Article 25. For the divulging of privacy notices, the data controller may use physical or electronic formats, verbal means or any other
technology, provided it complies with the duty to inform the data subject.
Contents of the Privacy Notice
Article 26. A privacy notice must contain the items referred to in Articles 8, 15, 16, 33, and 36 of the Law, as well as those established in

II.

The purposes of the processing, and

III.
The mechanisms offered by the data controller so that the data subject will be aware of the privacy notice in accordance with Article

controller in its request.
The proposal of the Institute shall be brought to the attention of the data controller so that it may take such action as it considers
appropriate within a period of no more than five days, calculated from the day following that on which it received notification.
If the data controller does not respond within the period mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Institute shall resolve the matter based
on the file of the matter.
When the Institute decides that the data controller does not justify the impossibility of bringing the privacy notice to the attention of the
data subject or that this requires disproportionate efforts, the use of compensatory measures shall not be authorized.

Personal data are presumed to comply with quality when they are directly provided by the data subject until he declares and proves
otherwise, or the data controller has objective evidence contradicting this.
When the personal data were not obtained directly from the data subject, the data controller must take reasonable measures for it to meet
the principle of quality in accordance with the type of personal data and the processing conditions.
The data controller must adopt the mechanisms that it considers necessary to ensure that personal data dealt with are exact, complete,
pertinent, correct, and up-to-date so that the truth of the data are not altered and the data subject thereby prejudiced by this.

be achieved when with clarity, and without giving rise to confusion and in an objective manner, the purpose for which personal data will be
processed is specified.
Differentiation of Purposes
Article 41. The data controller shall identify and distinguish in the privacy notice between the purposes that give rise to and are necessary
for the legal relationship between the data controller and the data subject from those that are not.
Objection to Processing for Different Purpose
Article 42. The data subject may refuse or revoke his consent, as well as object to the processing of his personal data for purposes
different from those that are necessary or that gave rise to the legal relationship between the data controller and the data subject, without
this having as a consequence, the termination of the processing for the latter two purposes.
Processing for Different Purpose
Article 43. The data controller may not carry out processing for different purposes that are not compatible or analogous to those for
which the personal data was originally collected and which were mentioned in the privacy notice unless:

(Third Section)

In the case of expert evidence or witness testimony, it shall be necessary to specify the facts they will deal with and indicate the name and
address of the expert or the witnesses, producing the list of questions or the interrogatories, respectively, to prepare the same. Without
these, the evidence will be deemed as not offered.
Conciliation
Article 120. After the request is admitted and without prejudice to the provisions of Article 54 of the Law, the Institute shall order
conciliation between the parties according to the following procedure:
I.
In the order admitting the request for protection of rights, the Institute shall require the parties to declare, by any means, their
willingness to reconcile, within a period of ten days, calculated from the date of notification of the order. The order shall contain a
summary of the request for protection of personal data and the response of the data controller, if any, indicating the common elements
and the points in dispute.
The conciliation may be held in person, by remote or local electronic communication means, or by any other means as determined by the
Institute. In any case, the conciliation shall be recorded using means that prove it took place.
The conciliation stage is waived when the data subject is a minor and any of the rights contemplated in the Law for the Protection of the
Rights of Children and Adolescents, related to the Law and these Regulations, were violated, unless the minor has duly accredited legal
representation.
II.
If the parties accept the possibility of reconciling, the Institute shall indicate the place or means, day and time for the conciliation
hearing which shall take place within twenty days after the Institute receives the declaration of the willingness of the parties to reconcile,
attempting to reconcile the interests of the data subject and the data controller.
The conciliator may, at any time during the conciliation, require the parties to produce within a maximum period of five days, the evidence
that they consider necessary for the conciliation.
The conciliator may suspend the conciliation hearing when he deems it appropriate or at the request of both parties, up to two times. If the
hearing is suspended, the conciliator shall state the day and time for its resumption.
A record shall be made of any conciliation hearing, showing its result. If the data controller or the data subject or their respective
representatives do not sign the record, this will not affect its validity, it being necessary to state the refusal.
III.
If a party does not attend the conciliation hearing and justifies the absence within a period of five days, a second conciliation
hearing will be called. If the party does not attend the latter hearing, the proceedings for the protection of rights will continue. If a party fails
to attend a conciliation hearing without justification, the proceedings shall continue.
IV.

In the absence of agreement in the conciliation hearing, the proceedings for the protection of rights will continue;

V.
If reconciliation is achieved at the hearing, the agreement shall be put in writing and will be binding and shall state, if applicable, the
period for it to be complied with, and
VI.
Compliance with the agreement shall terminate the proceedings for the protection of rights; if not complied with, the Institute shall
resume the proceedings.
The period referred to in Article 47 of the Law will be suspended during the period for compliance with the conciliation agreement.
The procedure established in this Article does not prevent the Institute, pursuant to Article 54 of the Law, from seeking conciliation at any
time during the procedure for the protection of rights.
Hearing
Article 121. For the purposes of the penultimate paragraph of Article 45 of the Law, the Institute shall determine, if applicable, the place
or means, date and time for the hearing, which may be postponed only for justified cause. At the hearing, evidence which by its nature so
requires, shall be submitted and a record of this made.
Presentation of Arguments
Article 122. Once an order had been made recording that all evidence had been submitted, the file will be made available to the parties in
order for them to formulate arguments, if they wish to do so, within a period of five days, calculated from the notification of the order
referred to in this Article. At the end of this period, the proceedings shall be closed and the Institute shall issue its decision within the
period established in Article 47 of the Law.
Interested Third Party
Article 123. If no interested third party has been indicated, a third party may appear in the proceedings by filing a document proving his
legal standing to intervene in the matter and may do so up to the closing of the proceedings. Such party must attach to his document the
document proving his identity when he does not act in his own name and the documentary evidence offered by him.
Lack of Response
Article 124. If the proceedings begin due to a failure of the data controller to respond to a request for the exercise of ARCO rights, the
Institute shall send a copy to the data controller so that it may prove, as applicable, that it did respond the request, or in the absence
thereof, issue a response and communicate this to the data subject with a copy to the Institute within a period of ten days from the
notification.

Chapter X
Procedure for Imposing Sanctions
Beginning
Article 140. For the purposes of Article 61 of the Law, the Institute shall begin proceedings for imposing sanctions when, from
proceedings for the protection of rights or from an inspection, presumed violations of the Law capable of being sanctioned under Article 64
of the Law have been seen. Once the proceedings for doing so have been completed, the appropriate decision will be issued.
The proceedings will begin by notification to the presumed violator at the address recorded with the Institute in the proceedings for the
protection of rights or inspection.
The notification will be accompanied by a report describing the facts constituting the presumed violation, summoning the presumed
violator to provide a response within a period of fifteen days, calculated from the day on which the notification takes effect, and offer the
evidence it considers appropriate.
Offer and Submission of Evidence
Article 141. The presumed violator shall make concrete statements in its response concerning each of the facts expressly imputed to him,
affirming them, denying them, indicating that he has no knowledge of them because they are not his own or explaining how they occurred,
as the case may be; and will submit arguments to deny the violation of which he is charged and the evidence thereof.
If expert or witness testimony evidence is offered, the facts to be dealt with must be specified and the names and addresses of the expert
or witnesses must be stated, attaching the list of questions or interrogatories, respectively, needed to prepare the same. Without these
indications, the evidence shall be deemed as not offered.
Admission and Rejection of Evidence
Article 142. Concerning the offer of evidence by the presumed violator, a decision must be made admitting or rejecting the same, and
evidence will then be submitted.
If necessary, the place, date and time will be established for the submission of evidence, which by its nature, requires this. A record of the
hearing and submission of evidence shall be prepared.
Closing of the Proceedings and Decision
Article 143. After the submission of evidence, if applicable, the presumed violator shall be notified that he has five days to submit
arguments, calculated from the day on which the notification takes effect. At the end of this period, the proceedings will be closed and the
decision of the Institute shall be issued within a period not exceeding fifty days from the beginning of the proceedings.
In justified cases, the Plenum of the Institute may extend once, for up to a period equal to the period of fifty days referred to in the
previous paragraph.

have been made or created before the entry into force of the Law. It shall not be necessary to obtain the consent of the data subjects for
personal data obtained prior to the entry into force of the Law, provided that it complies with the following paragraph.
Data controllers that have collected personal data before the entry of the Law into force and that continue processing the same shall make
a privacy notice available to the data subjects or, as the case may be, use any of the compensatory measures, as required, in accordance
with the provisions of Article 18 of the Law and Articles 32, 33, 34, and 35 of these Regulations.
A data subject may exercise his ARCO rights with respect to the processing of which he is informed in the privacy notice or the
