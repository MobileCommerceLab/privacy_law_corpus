Fair Market Value
1/
For the purposes of the tax laws and subject to Article 79
of the Federal Income Tax Proclamation, the fair market
value of goods, an asset, service, or benefit at a particular
time and place is the ordinary open market value of the
goods, asset, service, or benefit at that time and place.
2/
If it is not possible to determine the fair market value of
goods, an asset, service, or benefit under sub-article (1)
of this Article, the fair market value is the consideration
any similar goods, asset, service, or benefit would
ordinarily fetch in the open market at that time and place,
adjusted to take account of the differences between the
similar goods, asset, service, or benefit and the actual
goods, asset, service, or benefit.
3/
For the purposes of sub-article (2) of this Article, goods,
an asset, service, or benefit is similar to other goods,
asset, service, or benefit, as the case may be, if it is the
same as, or closely resembles, the other goods, asset,
service, or benefit in character, quality, quantity,
functionality, materials, and reputation.
4/
If the fair market value of goods, an asset, service, or
benefit cannot be determined under the preceding subarticles of this Article, the fair market value shall be the
amount determined by the Authority provided it is
consistent with generally accepted principles of
valuation.
5/
For the avoidance of doubt, the fair market value of
goods, an asset, service, or benefit may be greater or
lesser than the actual price charged for the goods, asset,
service, or benefit.

FEDERAL TAX ADMINISTRATION PROCLAMATION 11
6/

4.

The Authority may issue a Directive for the purposes of
determining the fair market value of any goods, asset,
service, or benefit.
Related Persons
1/

(2) of this Article, two persons are related persons when
the relationship between the two persons is such that one
person may reasonably be expected to act in accordance
with the directions, requests, suggestions, or wishes of
the other person, or both persons may reasonably be
expected to act in accordance with the directions,
requests, suggestions, or wishes of a third person.
2/
Two persons are not related persons solely by reason of
the fact that one person is an employee or client of the
other, or both persons are employees or clients of a third
person.
3/
Without limiting the generality of sub-article (1) of this
Article, the following are related persons:
