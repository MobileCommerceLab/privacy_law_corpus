EXPI,ANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations prescribe a range of matters for the purposes of the Data
Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017 ("the Law") and the Data Protection

(Law Enforcement and Related Matters) (Bailiwick of Guemsey) Ordinance, 2018
("the Law Enforcement Ordinance").

Regulation 1 prescribes the form and manner in which individuals carrying on a
business in partnership may apply for registration as controllers under the Law.
Regulation 2 prescribes the fee payable in respect of an application for registration.
The fee is set out in Schedule 1 as the registration fee. Non profit organisations and
elected representatives pay a nil fee.

53

Regulation 3 prescribes the information to be included in an application for
registration and requires the Data Protection Authority to notify the controller or
processor concerned after registration is effected.

Regulation 4 requires the Authority to maintain the most up-to-date register
particulars available in the register of controllers and processors and to publish those
particulars.

Regulation s requires registered controllers and registered processors to notify the
Authority of any changes in the register particulars or the general description of
security measures provided to the Authority. Failure to do so is an offence
punishable by a fine.

Regulation 6 requires registered controllers and registered processors to pay an
annual levy to the Authority and imposes penalties for late payment of the levy. The
aru'iual levy and late payment penalties are set out in Schedule 1. Non profit
organisations and elected representatives are exempt from the levy.

Regulations 7 and 8 require controllers and processors, respectively, to keep records
in relation to processing activities.

Regulation 9 exempts controllers or processors with fewer than 250 employees from
those record-keeping duties where the processing is occasional, excludes special
category data and is not high-risk processing.

Regulation 10 prescribes the time for which records required under the Law
(including any Ordinance or regulations made under it) must be kept.

Regulation 11 authorises personal data, includin7 in certain cases, special category
data, to be processed by specified persons for specified purposes under specified

54

conditions, as set out in Schedule 2. Such processing of personal data would be
lawful for the purposes of section 7 of the Law, and i?n the case of rows 13 to 16 of the

table in Schedule 2, would also be lawful for the purposes of the Law Enforcement
Ordinance.

Regulation 12 authorises the transfer of personal data to a person in an unauthorised
jurisdiction by the Guemsey Financial Services Commission or International Stock
Exchange Authority Limited, where the transfer is in the form of a disclosure

authorised or required by any enactment and takes place under the conditions set
out in Schedule 3. Such a transfer would be authorised for the purposes of the Law.

Regulation 13 amends Schedule 8 to the Law to insert a number of further

exemptions, exceptions and modifications in relation to designated provisions of that
Law (such as data subject rights and the duty to notify data subjects of personal data
breaches in certain circumstances). Many of these are similar to exemptions,
exceptions and modifications that were provided for in Orders made under the Data

Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2001, as well as provisions of that Law itself.

Regulation 14 disapplies section 16(2), (3) and (4) of the Law in circumstances where

education, health or social assistance data would be disclosed relating to identifiable
or identified individuals in the education, health or social assistance sectors who

would normally expect their identity, etc. to be disclosed in response to a request
made by the data subject for such data. The exception to this disapplication is where
the controller has reason to be concerned that the disclosure of that data would be

likely to result in a real and substantial risk to a vital interest of the individual
concerned.

Regulation 15 continues the register of controllers formerly kept under the nowrepealed Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guemsey) Law, 2001 ("the former Law") as
the register to be maintained under the new Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey)
Law, 2017 subject to any necessary revisions.

55

Regulation 16 deems controllers notified under the former Law to be temporarily
registered under the new Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017, until
the first anniversary of the previous notification, unless the controller is registered
earlier.

Regulation 17 exempts processors and controllers that were not required to be
notified under the former Law from the requirement to register. But this exemption

does not apply to high-risk processing and in any case expires on the 25th May, 2019.

Regulation 18 sets out the interpretation provisions. Regulations 19 and 20 are the
citation and commencement provisions respectively.

These Regulations come into force on the 25th May, 2018.
