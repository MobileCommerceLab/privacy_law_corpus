â—‡ Emergence of new data technologies such as big data and Internet of Things
(IoT), and the convergence technology has provided an opportunity to Korea, an
IT power house, to make a new leap forward. Despite the fact, concerns over
personal data infringement, which can be possibly resulted from the use of new
data technologies, present us a challenge to strike a balance between development
of new industries and personal data protection.

â—‡ In this regard, the guidelines for De-identification of personal data was published
under the joint leadership of the Korean government including the Office for
Government

Policy

Coordination,

the

Ministry

of

Interior,

the

Korea

Communications Commission, the Financial Services Commission, the Ministry of
Science, ICT and Future Planning, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to
provide clear standards on de-identification of personal data and scopes on
utilizing de-identified data for the safe use of big data within the current legal
boundary of personal data protection. By doing so, we aim to reduce uncertainties
that businesses have in order to encourage corporate investment and industry
development as well as strive our best to protect personal data.

â—‡ Furthermore, any de-identified data which has undergone appropriate de-identification
measures in accordance with the guidelines is presumed non personal data, thus
can be used for a big data analysis or other purposes.
â—‡ One thing to note about is that re-identification of de-identified data is not entirely
impossible due to technology development and increasing the amount of data.
Therefore, businesses should take safety measures in terms of management and
technology to prevent re-identification for the safe use of de-identified data.

â³’. Background

â…  # Background
ã…Leading countries in IT such as the US and UK are implementing policies to promote the data industry
as demand for the use of data increases due to development of IT convergence technologies such as big
data and IoT.
ã…5he Korean government aims to lay the foundation for the safe use of big data and strengthen personal
data protection by providing detailed standards, procedures, and methods of de-identification for big data
utilization.

ìˆ” Increased Value of Data in Its Usage Thanks to Expansion of the Government 3.0* and
Big Data Utilization
â—‹ Providing and sharing of public data are essential to achieve transparent and efficient
government operation while big data utilization is absolutely necessary to execute
science policies and provide customized services.
* In 2013, the central government and municipalities put forward the Government 3.0 as a
new governance paradigm aimed at creating new markets and jobs by making
government data available to public.

â—‹ In particular, creation of new services through big data analysis and IoT technologies,
and increasing value of big data in its usage are highly expected.
ìˆ• Continuous Social Demand for Enhanced personal data Protection
â—‹ The Korean society has raised its voice for a need to enhance personal data protection
policies as personal data leakage, regardless of its size, continuously breaks out.
â—‹ Also, a risk of possible personal data infringement is on the rise along with
development of new industries and technologies that require utilization of various data.
ìˆ– Active Response to Political Changes of the World that Seeks Harmony between
Protection and Utilization
â—‹ Leading countries in IT such as the US and UK are implementing policies to promote
the data industry while minimizing the possibility of personal data infringement.
â—‹ There is a need to come up with safety measures to prevent infringement of privacy
and provide a detailed guidelines to well utilize de-identified data at the industrial
level.

Overview

â—‹ The guidelines provide standards for businesses which intend to use or provide
de-identified personal data.
à¬– personal data shall be managed under a applicable law when collected and used in
accordance with related laws namely the Statistics Act.

â—‹ Measures to take at each step
â‘  (Preliminary Review) Verify whether specific data is personal data or not. data that is
confirmed to be non-personal data can be used as freely as possible without any
legal restrictions.
â‘¡ (De-identification) Take measures to make individuals unidentifiable by means of, for
example, deleting or replacing all or some of the elements from dataset.
â‘¢ (Adequacy Assessment) Assess whether an individual is identifiable by easily combining
de-identified data with other data by the â€œDe-identification Adequacy Assessment
Panelâ€ (the Assessment Panel).
â‘£ (Follow-up Management) Take necessary measures such as safety measures for
de-identified data and monitoring likelihood of re-identification to prevent
re-identification in the process of using de-identified data.

<Procedure for De-identification and Follow-up Management>

Standards for De-identification at Each Step

2-î¦¾G Preliminary Review : Review whether specific data is personal data or not.
â—‹ Businesses which intend to process data for a number of purposes including big data
analysis shall refer to the below standards to verify whether specific data is personal
data or not.
â—‹ If the specific data is clearly confirmed to be non-personal data, it can be used for
big data analysis without additional measures.
á¤ Otherwise, taking a next step is necessary.

<Reference> Judgment criteria for personal information
A. The concept of personal data provided in related laws such as the Personal Data
Protection Act is as follows. If not applicable, specific data is not personal data.
B. personal data means î¨®G data that can î¨¯G identify a î¨°G living î¨±G person and includes
î¨²G data that can be easily combined with other data when given data is not enough
to identify a specific person.
î¨® There is no special limitation on data regarding its type, form, characteristics, and
format.
î¨¯G data that is unable to identify a specific person is not personal data.
* A subject who â€œidentifiesâ€ an individual is a personal data controller (including third party
who is provided data). data that canâ€™t be used to identify an individual from the
perspective of personal data controller is not personal data.

î¨°G data about a dead person, corporate, group or object is not personal data as it
should be about a living person.
î¨±G data should be about a person, so statistical value of a group consists of multiple
individual is not personal data.
î¨²G â€˜easy combination with other dataâ€™ means that it should be possible to obtain
other information to be combined and there is a high possibility of combining
with other information.
* In other words, a concept of easy combination with other data does not include
data that canâ€™t be legally collected and requires irrational amount of time or costs
for collection.

2-î¦¿G De-identification : Apply De-identification Models

â–¡ De-identification Standards for Identifiers
â—‹ As a rule, an identifier* included in datasets should be deleted.
* An "identifier" is data such as a value or a name uniquely assigned to an individual
or a thing related to the individual.
â—‹ However, an identifier that is absolutely needed for a purpose of the use of data can
be utilized after de-identification.

<Example> Identifiers

ïˆ¥G Unique identifier (resident registration number, passport number, alien registration number,
and driverâ€™s license number)
ïˆ¥G Name (in Chinese characters, English name, and pen name)
ïˆ¥G Detailed address (house numbers and street addresses)
ïˆ¥G Date data : Date of birth (lunar/solar calendar), anniversary date (wedding, first
birthday, 60th birthday, etc.), date of obtaining a certificate, etc.
ïˆ¥G Phone number (mobile, home, office, fax, etc.)
ïˆ¥G Medical record number, national health insurance number, welfare recipient number
ïˆ¥G Bank account number, credit card number
ïˆ¥G Certificates and driverâ€™s license number
ïˆ¥G License plate number, and registration number and serial number of different equipment
ïˆ¥G Photos (still picture, video, CCTV videos, etc.)
ïˆ¥G Biometric data (fingerprint, voice, iris, etc.)
ïˆ¥G E-mail address, IP address, Mac address, homepage URL, etc.
ïˆ¥G Identification code (ID, employee number, customer number, etc.)
ïˆ¥G Other unique identification number: Military service number, business registration
number, etc.
í¿ŠG Refer to the â€œHIPAA Privacy Ruleâ€ issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services

  

â–¡ De-identification Standards for Attribute Values
â—‹ As a rule, an attribute value included in datasets should be also removed if it is
irrelevant to a purpose of the use of data.
- De-identification measures such as pseudonymization and aggregation should be taken
if an attribute value related to the use of data has identifiable elements.
â—‹ Attribute values like rare disease or unique professional experiences need strict de-identification
as they are highly likely to identify an individual under certain circumstances.
<Example> Attribute Values

Individual
Characteristics

ïˆ¥G Gender, age, nationality, hometown, address, postal code, military
service record, marital status, religion, hobbies, club/group affiliation,
etc.

â–¡ Methods of De-identification
â—‹ A range of methods including pseudonymization, aggregation, data suppression and data
masking can be used individually or in combination.
í¿Š Applying a pseudonymization method alone hardly seems as a sufficient de-identification.
â—‹ There are various kinds of technology in place to realize each method. The most
suitable methods and specific techniques need to be chosen and utilized based on the
purpose of data usage, and strengths and weaknesses of each method.
á¤ Take a next step once de-identification is completed.

2-î§€G Adequacy Assessment: Utilize a k-Anonymity Model
â–¡ Need for Adequacy Assessment
â—‹ An individual could be identified by data combination or using various inference
techniques when de-identification are not sufficient.
â—‹ Thus, there is a need to form the Assessment Panel involving external professionals
under the leadership of a privacy officer to strictly assess possibilities of identifying an
individual.
â—‹ The k-Anonymity Model will be used among other privacy protection models when
assessing adequacy.
- k-Anonymity is a basic means of assessment. Additional assessment models (l-diversity
and t-accessibility) can be applied if necessary.
< Case of Netflix (2006, US) >

ïˆ¥G Netflix, a company that provides online streaming media, held the Netflix Prize to
increase the accuracy of algorithm that is used to recommend movies tailored
to interests of their customers.
- Netflix provided a training dataset of 100,480,507 ratings that 480,189 users
gave to 17,770 movies from Dec. 1999 to Dec. 2005.
à¬– Although names and other data that could identify users were removed, unique
identifiers, movie reviews, and review dates were disclosed in order to connect
with the outcome of data processing.

ïˆ¥G A group at the University of Texas identified certain individuals by combining a
viewing history disclosed by Netflix and user reviews disclosed in the IMDb
(Internet Movie Database).
à¬– IMDb posts IDs and evaluation scores on its website.

ïˆ¥G The 2nd Netflix Prize was cancelled as the US Fair Trade Commission (FTC)
raised privacy concerns.

  

â–¡ Adequacy Assessment Procedures
â‘  (Preparing Basic Documents) A personal data controller shall prepare basic documents
needed for adequacy assessment such as a data statement, de-identification status, and
the management level of user organizations*.
* â€˜user organizationâ€™ means that an organization intends to utilize the de-identified data.
à½œ (Organizing an Assessment Panel) A Privacy Officer shall organize the Assessment
Panel comprised of more than three people (external professionals should be more than
a majority).
à½ (Conducting Assessment) The Assessment Panel shall assess adequacy of the level of
de-identification measures using the basic documents prepared by the personal data

  

â‘¢ Adequacy Assessment
â—‹ The Assessment Panel assesses adequacy of de-identification based on basic documents
and using the k-Anonymity model.
<Adequacy Assessment Execution Process>

í¿ŠG Procedures were established based on the guidelines for Managing Disclosure of De-Identified
Health Information (October 2010, Canada).
a (Preliminary Review) Review prepared basic documents and interview to check out
â—¯

whether personal identification elements are in dataset, whether the purpose of
utilization and de-identification methods are appropriate.
b (Analysis Possibility of Re-identification Attempt) Analyze possibilities of re-identification
î­

attempt including intention, level of personal data protection and capability of the
personal data controller who uses or receives the data.
c (Analysis Re-identification Impact) Assess possible impact on a data subject when data
î­

is intentionally or unintentionally re-identified.
d (Quantitative Analysis) Verify the accuracy of a k value provided by a personal data
î­

controller.
  

e (Determination of Reference Value) The Assessment Panel determines the assessment
î­

reference value (k-anonymity value) by taking into consideration possibilities of
re-identification, impact of re-identification, results of quantitative analysis and purpose
of data utilization comprehensively.
<Example: Safety Criteria of the Privacy Protection Technical Support Center
of the US Department of Education>
î¬•G â€œk=3â€ is the minimum level that guarantees safety.
î¬•G â€œ5îƒµkîƒµ10â€ means relatively high safety.
í¿ŠG The k-Anonymity value is the recommended standard to legally allow providing of data.

(Adequacy Assessment) Decide adequacy of de-identification by comparing calculated
values resulted from the average reference value and quantitative analysis.

î¬•G Adequate if a k value from the result of quantitative analysis is 4 and an
average reference value is 3
î¬•G Inadequate if a k value from the result of quantitative analysis is 4 and an
average reference value is 6
dequate Ö² Data can be utilized and provided.
- Inadequate Ö² Additional de-identification measures and re-assessment are required.
Additional De-identification Measures
 Personal data controller shall implement additional de-identification measures based on
feedback from the Assessment Panel if the assessment result is inadequate.
 The Assessment Panel shall proceed to re-assessment once personal data controller
completes implementation of additional de-identification.
Data Utilization
Utilize the de-identified data in big data analysis or allow providing it to a third party if
de-identification are assessed (reassessed) to be adequate.
In principle, providing or disclosing data to public or uncontracted data user is prohibited
as there can be a high risk of re-identification.
  

à¬– Except in cases where data is provided pursuant to relevant laws such as the Act
on Promotion of the Provision and Use of Public Data.
â—‹ Immediately destroy data once the purpose of using data is fulfilled or it is no longer
needed.
â—‹ The follow-up management steps below should be observed in the process of utilizing
data for effective usage in a form of de-identified data.

Security Measures for De-identified data

â—‹ Safety measures must be implemented as there is a possibility of re-identification if
de-identified data is leaked and combined with other data.
- (Managerial Safety Measures) Need to designate a person in charge of de-identified
data files, prohibit sharing of data on de-identification, and destroy data once a
purpose of usage is achieved.
- (Technical Safety Measures) Need to restrict access to de-identified data files, manage
access records, and install and operate security programs.

de-identification.
â—‹ Actively counteract to risks of re-identification caused by emergence of convergence
technologies such as the Artificial Intelligence.
â–¡ Support System and Its Details
ã…Specialized Agency in Each Sector
â—‹ A specialized agency in each sector is designated and operated under the supervision
of relevant government ministries.
à¬– Government ministries, in a form of official letter, designate and announce specialized
agencies for each sector such as the Korea Internet & Security Agency, Korea Credit
Information Services, the Financial Security Institute, the Social Security Information
Service, and the National Information Society Agency. If necessary, the government
ministries may additionally designate specialized agencies.

â—‹ Roles of Specialized Agencies in Each Sector
- Organize and operate a pool of experts (de-identification experts, legal experts, etc.) to
support making up the Assessment Panel at personal data controller.
- Recommend implementation of essential de-identification (k value of k-anonymity, etc.)
tailored to each industry.
* Industries such as medicine, welfare, education, finance and credit, communications,
distribution, and public.

- Check adequacy of de-identification measures of personal data controller.

# Support the Combination of Datasets between Personal
Data Controllers through Specialized Agencies

â–¡ Need for Support
â—‹ Datasets owned by different personal data controllers are needed to be combined for big
data analysis. To do this, a key to create a dataset by matching different datasets is
required.
- When creating the key, using direct identifiers that can identify an individual could
possibly lead to violation of current laws. (Article 18 of the personal data Protection
Act, Restrictions on the Use and Provision of personal data for any purposes other
than the intended ones)
â—‹ Therefore, in order to combine and analyze datasets, it is necessary to use 'Temporary
Linking Key', which temporarily serves as a matching key only in the combining
process.
â—‹ Even if the combination using the temporary linking key is permitted, a support and
management system is required to prevent the possibility of personal information
infringement through indiscriminate combination.
â–¡ Support and Management System
â—‹ Specialized agencies in each sector shall support combination of datasets between
personal data controllers.
â—‹ Criteria for Selecting Specialized Agencies
- Combining datasets between corporations in the same industry shall be supported by
specialized agencies in the same sector.
- Combining datasets between personal data controllers in the different industry shall be
supported by specialized agencies in their respective sectors.
- The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) and the National Information Society
Agency (NIA) shall support the industry where there is no specialized agency.
  

â—‹ Key Roles and Responsibilities of Specialized Agencies
- Support combination of datasets between personal data controllers through using temporary
linking key provided by them.
- Prohibited any attempts to identify individuals from the given datasets.
- Immediately destroy all datasets once combining datasets and providing data are completed
â—‹ Each ministry shall draw and implement detailed guidelines regarding specialized
agencies under their supervision.

â–¡ Procedure and Requirements for Dataset Combination
ã…Combination Procedures

â‘  Each personal data controller shall make temporary linking key(which is made from
identifiers) by applying the same algorithm with other personal data controller, and
carry out de-identification measures and adequacy assessment on the datasets.
à¬– Noise should be added to a temporary linking key when creating it, and when a temporary
linking key is made from more than 2 identifiers it shall take necessary measures to
prevent identifying a specific individual from illegal decryption by combining some
identifiers or from combination with original data.

â‘¡ Personal data controllers provide de-identified datasets to specialized agency and request
its combination.
à¬– In this case, the specialized agencies canâ€™t identify a specific individual from the provided
de-identified datasets.

â‘¢ Specialized agency combines datasets using the temporary linking key.
à½ And then, shall destroy the temporary linking key.
à½ŸG Specialized agency provides the combined dataset to personal data controller who requested
dataset combination. (The specialized agencies shall destroy the combined dataset after
providing it.)
à¬– personal data controllers are very difficult to re-identify a specific person from the
combined dataset since there is no temporary linking key in the dataset.
  

Procedures for Combining data Datasets between
Personal Data Controllers through Temporary Linking Key>

ã…Matters to Consider When Combining Datasets
â—‹ Personal data controller A and B shall not share algorithm information about temporary
linking key with specialized agencies of each sector.
â—‹ Using resident registration numbers is prohibited when creating a temporary linking
key. (Article 24-2 of the personal data Protection Act, Restriction on the Management
of Resident Registration Numbers)
â—‹ A value of k-anonymity shall be calculated without temporary linking key.
* Inclusion of the temporary linking key will make the value of k-anonymity equal to 1,
which leads result of adequacy assessment to â€˜inadequateâ€™.

â—‹ Specialized agencies shall immediately destroy de-identified data when re-identification is
detected in the process of combination.
â—‹ A data user that receives the combined dataset shall conduct appropriate adequacy
assessment before using the it.

# Legal Sanctions against Re-identification

â–¡ Criminal Punishments
â—‹ Where re-identified data is used or provided to a third party
(Example 1)
Where rendered personal data, as a result of sharing tips on de-identification techniques
to researchers, is provided for a purpose other than the intented one while providing
de-identified data.
(Example 2)
Where critical identifiable elements (name, date of birth, phone number, etc.) are
provided to a third party in a form of easy re-identification like encrypting with open
algorithms.
(Example 3)
Where de-identified data is preserved on purpose and used for various purposes like
one-on-one marketing.

- Applicable to the use and provision of personal data for purposes other than the
intended use (Violation of the Article 18.1 of the Personal Data Protection Act,
Articles 24 and 24.2 of the Act on the Promotion of data and Communications
Network Utilization and data Protection, Etc. (â€œNetwork Actâ€), and Articles 32 and 33
of the Credit data Use and Protection Act (â€œCredit data Actâ€).
- Subject to imprisonment not exceeding five years or fine not exceeding 50 million
won(about 43,000$).
G G G G G à¬– Service providers subject to the Network Act may be imposed of additional
surcharge less of 3% of their sales related to a violation.

penalty

â–¡ Administrative Measures
â—‹ Where de-identified data is re-identified, but still in preservation without immediate
destruction.

  

(Example)
Those who received de-identified data have re-identified a particular individual
while doing their jobs, but still have the re-identified data instead of
destroying it immediately.

- Applicable to collection of personal data without the consent of a data subject
(Violation of the Article 15.1 of the Personal Data Protection Act,

and Article 15.2

of the Credit data Act)
- Subject to a administrative fine not exceeding 50 million won(about 43,000$).
à¬– According to Article 22.1 of the Network Act, service providers subject to this Act may
be imprisoned up to five years or imposed of fine not exceeding 50 million won(about
43,000$). They also may pay additional penalty surcharge less than 3% of sales related a
violation.
