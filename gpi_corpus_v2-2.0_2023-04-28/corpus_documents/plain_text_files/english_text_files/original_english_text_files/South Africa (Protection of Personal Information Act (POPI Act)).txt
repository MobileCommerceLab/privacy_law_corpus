RECOGNISING THAT—
●

AND BEARING IN MIND THAT—
●

consonant with the constitutional values of democracy and openness, the need for

requires the removal of unnecessary impediments to the free ﬂow of information,
including personal information;

AND IN ORDER TO—
●

regulate, in harmony with international standards, the processing of personal
information by public and private bodies in a manner that gives effect to the right
to privacy subject to justiﬁable limitations that are aimed at protecting other rights
