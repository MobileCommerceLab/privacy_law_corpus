1 Scope
These guidelines are intended to provide B2C licensees with guidance on the processing of personal
data carried out throughout the course of their gaming service operations.
These Guidelines have been developed after a consultation process with the Information and Data
Protection Commissioner who ascertained that the provisions of these Guidelines comply with the
General Data Protection Regulation. This notwithstanding, such guidelines and the interpretations
contained herein are without prejudice to any decision which the Commissioner may take in relation
to complaints and, or to any other specific data protection issue. These interpretations are also
without prejudice to any further guidelines or opinions that might be issued by the Article 29 Data
Protection Working Party and, as from 25th May 2018, by the European Data Protection Board.
These Guidelines are considered to be a living document and will be further developed over time as
practical issues arise with the effective implementation of the GDPR.
These guidelines are to be read in parallel with legal requirements imposed on Operators by virtue of
Maltese gaming laws, and are without prejudice to the said legislation. These guidelines are not
intended to replace any law, legal obligation or decision.

2 Definitions
Personal data: means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (in the
following defined also as "data subject"); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly
or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number (e.g.
client number), location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.
Special categories of personal data: means personal data disclosing racial or ethnic origin, religious or
philosophical beliefs or trade-union membership, as well as genetic data, biometric data aimed at
unequivocally identifying a natural person, data related to the health or sex life or sexual orientation
of the person.
For the avoidance of any doubt, data pertaining to self-exclusions is not considered to be data related
to health, and hence does not fall under special categories of personal data. In the event that,
throughout the course of communication with a player, a B2C licensee is forwarded any specific
medical data, such as a doctor’s report, or information about a player’s health, such information is to
be treated as a special category of personal data and therefore the provisions and safeguards
applicable to such data as laid down within the GDPR are to be adhered to.
Processing: means any operation or set of operations performed upon personal data or sets of
personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation,
structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or
destruction.
Data controller: means the entity which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and
means of the processing of personal data.

Public

`

Last updated May 2018
For the purposes of the GDPR, a B2C licence holder which determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data is considered a data controller.
Data processor: means the entity (company or individual) processing personal data on behalf of the
controller.
For example, a cloud service provider is considered a data processor processing data on behalf of the
company (client) which determines the purposes and means of the processing of its customers’
personal data.

3 Applicability
3.1

Territorial scope

From a territorial perspective, the GDPR does not differentiate between data controller and data
processor and sets out the same territorial scope for both of them.
Mainly, the GDPR applies in the following two situations:
–

–

the processing of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment
(i.e. the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements) of the controller
or processor within the EU; or
the processing of the data of individuals within the EU takes place by a controller or processor
not established in the EU.

For the applicability of the GDPR, it is therefore not necessarily decisive where the data is being
processed.
These guidelines apply to B2C licensees that process personal data during the course of their business
activities of an establishment in Malta regardless of whether the actual processing takes place in the
EU or otherwise.
Non-EU established companies will be subject to the GDPR where they process personal data about
EU data subjects in connection with:
-

the offering of goods or services” (payment is not required); or
monitoring data subjects' behaviour within the EU (including online profiling activities, i.e. the
tracking of individuals online to create profiles, including where this is used to take decisions
to analyse/predict personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes).

While reference is made to data processors, such as cloud service providers and data centers,
throughout the guidelines, this document is by no means sufficient to ensure their compliance with
the GDPR, and it is advised that data processors seek further legal guidance on the matter.

3.2

Material scope

The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means (the latter
meaning any processing where certain steps are carried out by individuals, such as entering data into
a computer) and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which is
contained or intended to be contained in a filing system which are structured according to specific
criteria.
Public

`

Last updated May 2018

The material scope is interpreted in a very broad manner in order to ensure a high level of protection,
so basically the GDPR will become relevant for companies as soon as any processing of personal data
takes place.

4 Lawful Processing of Personal Data
Under the GDPR, personal data can only be processed if, and to the extent that, at least one legal basis
for the processing listed below applies:
a) the data subject has consented to the processing;
b) it is necessary for the entry into, or performance of, a contract with the data subject or in
order to take steps at his request prior to the entry into a contract;
c) it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under EU law or national law;
d) it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
person;
e) it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
of official authority vested in the controller; and, or
f) it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller (or by a
third party), except where the controller's interests are overridden by the interests,
fundamental rights or freedoms of the affected data subjects.
These guidelines will focus on four particular bases, ‘Legal obligation’, ‘Contract’, ‘Consent’ and
‘Legitimate Interest’ since it is expected that, generally, most of the Operators’ processing activities
will be carried out relying on one or more of such bases. It is imperative that Operators determine the
appropriate legal basis (or bases) from the start, since, as specified below, the legal basis on which the
personal data is being processed must be communicated to the respective data subjects.

4.1

Legal Obligation

A legal obligation imposed on the Operator by virtue of gaming legislation, AML legislation, or any
other specific law, may be determined as the appropriate basis on which to process players’ personal
data. References to such a basis are made throughout the document.

4.2

Contract

The contract entered into between a player and an Operator can serve as one of the legal basis on
which a player’s personal data is processed. However, the term ‘necessary for the performance of a
contract’ needs to be interpreted strictly. Processing is deemed necessary if the contract could not be
fulfilled without the processing taking place, therefore it is important to determine the scope of the
contract or service, and to limit the personal data being processed to what is strictly necessary in order
to provide the gaming service.
For example, processing personal data for marketing purposes cannot be considered to be strictly
necessary to offer a gaming service and consequently such processing activity must rely on a separate
consent which should be obtained in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR as explained
below. If the player refuses to consent to this processing purpose, the operator may not deny services
to the player, or apply any increased fees.

Public

`

For example, online subscription forms should clearly identify which fields are “required”, which are
not, and what will be the consequences of not filling in the required fields (e.g. the player will not be
able to receive special offers and promotions.
The contract itself, therefore, is not to include or to be merged with consent, when consent itself is
being used as a legal basis for processing which is not necessary for the performance of the contract.
It must be noted that the player may exercise the right to restriction, rectification and access when
the data processing is based on contract.

4.3

Consent

The more a controller relies on consent as a legal basis for the processing, the more the data subject
is in control of their activities, and the greater the trust between the two. However, it must be kept in
mind that consent may be withdrawn, and might hence not be an ideal basis for the processing of data
in the course of specific activities pertaining to the gaming operation.
Consent must be freely given: players must specifically opt-in by checking boxes which are not prechecked. Consent is not to be bundled up in non-negotiable terms and conditions, and is not to be
presumed to be given. Additionally, each specific tick-box for consent should only cover processing
activities which are carried out for the same purpose or purposes; multiple purposes must result in
multiple, specific consents1.
By way of a general example, in order for consent to be valid, separate consent must be sought from
the players when the operator would like to send marketing via email, and when the operator would
like to share the details of the player with other companies within the same group of companies or
with third parties outside the group.
If an Operator would like to process the data for a new purpose, then it would need to seek new
consent from the player for the new processing purpose. The original consent will never legitimise
further or new purposes for the processing2.
Consent to the processing of personal data that is unnecessary, cannot be seen as a mandatory
consideration in exchange for the performance of a contract or the provision of a service. Therefore,
as explained above, denial or withdrawal of consent for marketing purposes, may not result in the
Operator denying services to the player, or in the Operator applying any increased fees3.
In order to provide a summary, the data subject must be provided with the following information:
a) specific details on the operator which is seeking the consent, if the consent sought is to be
relied upon by multiple (joint) controllers or if the data is to be transferred to or processed by
other controllers who wish to rely on the original consent, these organisations should all be
named.(details of at least one data processor, such as cloud service providers and data
centers, need not be provided, although Operators will need to make available a full list of
recipients or categories of recipients including processors (please refer to section 5 -Right to
be informed - below for more details);

b) the purpose of every processing activity for which consent is being sought;
c) the type of data that will be collected and used;
d) the existence of the right to withdraw consent, and how one may avail himself of this right
(which in any case cannot be more burdensome than the manner in which one can give
consent, e.g. via the same electronic interface, like a website or an app, used to opt-in);
e) information about the use of the data for decisions based solely on automated processing,
including profiling (kindly refer to section 6 - Automated decision making and Profiling below).
It must be noted that data processing based on a player’s consent is subject to data portability (kindly
refer to section 5 -Right to Data Portability - for more information), and the player may exercise the
right to erasure, restriction, rectification and access.
If an Operator finds that the consent obtained under previous legislation will not meet the standard
of GDPR consent, then Operators must assess whether the processing may be based on a different
legal basis, taking into account the conditions laid down in the GDPR. If an Operator is unable to renew
consent in a compliant way, and is also unable to make the transition to GDPR compliance by basing
data processing on different legal basis while ensuring that continued processing is fair and accounted
for, the processing activities must be interrupted. In any event the controller needs to observe the
principles of lawful, fair and transparent processing. However, in the event that the previouslyobtained consent meets the standards of GDPR consent, and the purposes of the data processing will
be unchanged with regard to the consent which has already been obtained, it is not necessary for a
B2C licensee to obtain a new consent. Having said this, the controller is still required to inform the
data subjects about the new privacy terms, including the applicable rights, in line with the
transparency requirements set out under Article 13 of the GDPR.
As a general rule, if consent is withdrawn, all data processing operations that were based on consent
and took place before the withdrawal of consent - and in accordance with the GDPR - remain lawful,
however, the controller must stop the processing actions concerned. If there is no other lawful basis
justifying the processing (e.g. further storage) of the data, they should be deleted or anonymised by
the data controller4.

4.4

Legitimate Interest

A data controller may rely upon legitimate interest as legal basis for the processing of personal data,
subject to identifying a legitimate interest, establishing that the processing is ‘necessary’ and
conducting a balancing test. Legitimate interests can be those of the controller or a third party to
whom the personal data may be disclosed.
Operators should consider whether that processing is necessary for the pursuit of their commercial or
business objectives (i.e. there does not appear to be another way of achieving the identified interest),
and then confirm, by means of a balancing test, that the rights and freedoms of the player whose
personal data will be processed have been evaluated, and that these interests do not override the
Operator’s legitimate interests, taking into account, for example, the scale of data collection, the
nature of the interests, the impact of the processing and any safeguards which are or could be put in
place such as data minimisation, de-identification and data retention limits. If a player could not

Public

`

Page 8 of 29

Last updated May 2018
reasonably expect the processing, or if the processing causes unjustified harm, the player’s interests
will override the Operator’s ‘legitimate’ interests.
Practical scenarios: this is a broad, non-exhaustive list of examples, intended to give an illustration of
scenarios in which Operators may consider the use of legitimate interests as the basis for the
processing of personal data. All of these examples would be subject to the Operator conducting its
own balancing test in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR.
a) Fraud - An Operator wants to process a player’s personal data as part of its business critical
anti-fraud measures. Although this is undoubtedly in the interests of the Operator, it could
also be seen as benefitting other players, since the cost of fraud results in the restrictive offer
of bonuses and promotions generally.
b) Risk Assessment - Operators need to “risk assess” all their players for a number of scenarios
envisaged by separate legal obligations, including but not limited to anti-money laundering
(AML) and player protection obligations. However, risk-assessment are also carried out in
order for Operators to determine the nature of the products and services they are offering,
and the terms of those services. Although details of such processing should be included within
the privacy policy, it is not required that an Operator seeks consent for such risk-assessmentrelated processing.
c) Players who have opted-out of receiving marketing communications - In order to ensure that
a player who has opted-out of receiving marketing communications, but has not self-excluded,
receives no marketing communications, that player’s data must be held on a suppression file.
The legitimate interest ground may be satisfied here, as long as the Operator holds the
minimised amount of personal data possible in order to uphold this request.
d) Network security – Any network security activity undergone by an Operator and which is
considered to be an essential processing activity by the Operator, which activity is intended
to ensure that its customers are continually protected.
e) Personalisation and web-analytics – An Operator may rely on legitimate interests to justify
non-personalised analytics to inform its marketing strategy and to enable it to enhance and
personalise the “gaming experience” it offers to its players (in line with the relevant
Commercial Communications legislation).
f) Non-invasive profiling for direct marketing – While an Operator should generally rely on
consent for marketing communications, it may rely on legitimate interest for clustering
customers based on age group, location and game history for direct marketing purposes,
provided that the level of intrusiveness of the profiling is low and the appropriate measures
(including security measures and easy to use opt-out tools) are adopted to strengthen the
legitimacy of the processing and to genuinely balance the interests of the Operator with the
reasonable expectations of the players. However, when in doubt as to whether to rely on
consent or legitimate interest, it is advised that you seek guidance from your Lead Supervisory
Authority (LSA).
g) Customer Support logs – Even when the storage of such logs are not mandated by law, the
information within the logs may be used to manage disputes with players, to direct players to
responsible gaming support staff, and to improve the players’ experience. Such logs could also
be used to identify recurring software issues, and to analyse the patterns of behaviour of
customers and staff provided that an adequate balancing test has been carried out and such
analysis does not comprehend invasive profiling.
h) Artificial intelligence and machine learning - An Operator can put in place a system which
uses artificial intelligence and neural network to route customer communications to the most
Public

appropriate part of the organisation. These routes could link individuals to specific agents who
can handle specific requests, but in addition the algorithm might ask a series of questions and
provide appropriate answers without the need for human intervention. The system by
processing personal data of the individual would learn to optimize its suggestions and
answers.
Operators relying on legitimate interests as the basis for fair processing must maintain a record of the
assessment they have made, so that they can demonstrate that they have given proper consideration
to the rights and freedoms of data subjects in their determinations.
Additionally, it should be noted that the presumption of legitimacy may be challenged by an individual
(or group of individuals), in which case the processing must stop unless the controller can show
compelling grounds to continue with the processing which override the individual’s rights, or
alternatively if the processing is needed to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

5 Data Subjects’ Rights
The GDPR enshrines the various rights of data subjects to be observed and respected by controllers
and processors of personal data. The manner in which some of these rights are applicable to the
industry is outlined below:

5.1

Right to be Informed

The GDPR imposes a general obligation of transparency. Operators must be transparent on the data
they are processing by providing clear, concise, intelligible and easily accessible information notices
to all their players. These information notices, also known as privacy policies, are to be brought to the
attention of the data subject whose data is being processed by an Operator.

5.2

What should a privacy policy include?

Privacy policies should include the following minimum information:
a) Identity and contact details of the data controller, i.e. the Operator, who determines the
purpose of the processing and, where applicable, of the controller’s representative, as well as
the contact details of the Operator’s Data Protection Officer (DPO).
b) Purposes of processing and legal basis for processing – including the “legitimate interest”
pursued by the controller (or third party) if this is the legal basis chosen, i.e. the specific
interest in question must be identified. Furthermore operators should make clear to players
that they can obtain information on the balancing test, at the basis of the legitimate interest,
upon request5.
c) An Operator’s privacy policy should also inform players or potential players that when an
account is opened, the player(s) personal data may be processed for anti-money laundering
(AML) purposes, particularly in light of the exception detailed below.
d) Recipients, or categories of recipients. This includes other data controllers, joint controllers
and data processors to whom data is transferred or disclosed. The default position is that a
data controller should provide information on the actual (named) recipients of the personal
data. This means that the data processors should be listed in the privacy policy. Where a data
controller opts to only provide the categories of recipients, the data controller must be able

to demonstrate why it is fair for it to take this approach. In such circumstances, the
information on the categories of recipients should be as specific as possible by indicating the
type of recipient, for instance, by reference to the activities it carries out.
Details of data transfers outside the EU and the reference to the appropriate or suitable
safeguards. The data subject shall be provided also with the means to obtain a copy of them
or details as to where they have been made available (e.g. link to the website page of the
Standard Contractual Clauses).
The retention period for the data, or, if no period can be possibly set, the criteria used to set
this. It is not sufficient for the Operator to state that the personal data will be kept for as long
as necessary for the legitimate purposes of the processing.
That the player has a right to access his/her data, as well as rectify, erase and restrict it, as
well as to ‘port’ it (see right to data portability below).
That the player has a right to object to the processing or his/her data, and to withdraw
consent, if the processing is based on consent.
The possibility of a player to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority. This information
should explain that, in accordance with Article 77 of the GDPR, the player has the right to
lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her
habitual residence, place of work or place of an alleged infringement.
Whether there is a statutory or contractual requirement to provide the data and the
consequences of not providing that data (only applicable in relation to data collected directly
from the data subject). For example, upon registration, online forms should clearly identify
which fields are “required”, which are not, and what will be the consequences of not filling in
the required fields.
Whether or not there will be any automated decision taking, and if so, information about the
logic involved and the significance and consequences of the processing for the player.
Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the
consequences of such profiling together with meaningful information about the logic involved
and the significant and envisaged consequences of the processing for the data subject.

When is the privacy policy to be notified, and/or brought to the attention of the player?

As a general rule, a privacy policy is to be brought to a data subject’s attention when his/her data is
collected and also during the course of the Operator-player relationship.
Changes to a privacy policy should always be communicated if they include substantive modifications
(i.e a change to the identity of the controller or a change as to how data subjects can exercise their
rights in relation to the processing.) The GDPR provides further guidance as to when such information
must be provided. Specifically, this depends on the time as to when this data is collected: if this data
is collected directly from the player, then all the information must be provided at the time that the
data is obtained. If the Operator does not obtain this data directly from the player, then the Operator,
in addition to informing the subject of the source(s) of the information, even if it came from publicly
accessible sources, must provide such information:
i)

within a reasonable period of having obtained the data, but not later than one month from
having received it;
ii) if the said data is used to communicate with the individual, not later than when the first
communication takes place; or
iii) if the data is to be disclosed to another recipient, before such data is disclosed.

Given the long list of contents which are to be included within a privacy policy, it is understandably
challenging to provide the information efficiently and succinctly, however the below points are
intended to provide further guidance to assist Operators to fulfil their GDPR obligations in this regard:
a) The information should be clearly differentiated from other non-privacy related information,
for example contractual provisions or general terms and conditions of use.
b) Intelligibility is closely linked to the requirement to use clear and plain language. To this
extent, an accountable data controller will have knowledge about the people they collect
information about and it can use this knowledge to determine what that audience would likely
understand6.
c) Online Operators should ‘layer’ the information. This will enable a player to easily navigate
through headings of information within the privacy policy, and access any particular point
which he/she would like more detail on.
d) Within the registration-page, prior to registering as a player, the privacy policy should be
brought to the attention of the player.
e) Once the player has registered, and throughout the player’s use of the website, online
Operators should provide a link to the privacy policy on every page of the website. In the case
of applications, the information should be made available on the online store prior to
purchasing the product. Once the app is installed, the information still needs to be easily
accessible from within the app. Additionally, the privacy information in question should be
specific to the particular app and should not merely be the generic privacy policy of the
company that owns the app or makes it available to the public. Generally speaking, the entire
privacy policy should not be more than two clicks/ two taps away.
f) Land-based Operators should attach a printed copy of the privacy policy to the registration
form, where this is provided in hard-copy. If the form is filled on a computer device, a tablet
or similar tool, the registration form should include a link to the privacy policy.
g) When data is being collected from a data subject, the link to the policy should be immediately
accessible7.
h) The language must be as clear, and simplistic as possible, devoid of abstract or ambivalent
terms.
i) The purposes of, and legal basis for, processing the personal data should be clear. Words such
as “may”, “might”, “some”, “often” and “possible” should be avoided. Where data controllers
use indefinite language, they should be able to demonstrate why the use of such language
could not be avoided and how it does not undermine the fairness of processing.
j) The privacy policy should be in the English or Maltese language, and in all the languages of the
countries in which the Operator is providing the service.

5.4

When can an Operator process a player’s data without informing the player that such
processing is taking place?

Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR also provide a short list of exceptions to this obligation to provide
information. With regard to data which has been collected from the individual, the only exception
occurs when and insofar as, the data subject already has the information.8 Given that, within the
6

WP29 Guidelines on Transparency provide an example: “a controller collecting the personal data of working
professionals can assume its audience has a higher level of understanding than a controller that obtains the
personal data of children”.

gaming industry, most of the time data will be collected from the player at registration stage, it is
unlikely that the player would already have the privacy policy. Any time the player provides additional
data to the Operator after registration stage, although not necessarily required by law, it would be
considered best practice if the privacy policy is brought to the player’s attention once more.
Where personal data has not been collected from the data subject, an Operator may be exempt from
providing information regarding the processing of the data if:
a) The provision of such information would make the achievement of the objectives of the
processing impossible, or seriously impair them. To rely on this exception, Operators must
demonstrate that the provision of the information alone would nullify the objectives of the
processing. Of course there would need to be legal basis for the processing of the data, and it
must be done in a fair manner. To this end, such instances will be laid down within further
legal instruments issued under the Data Protection Act.
For example, Operators are subjected to a mandatory requirement under Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) legislation to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held with it to
the relevant gaming and/or financial authority. The AML legislation in question makes it a
criminal offence for a reporting Operator to “tip-off” the account-holder that may be subject
to regulatory investigations. Such a scenario qualifies as an exception, however upon
registering an account, all account-holders should have been provided with general
information informing them that the players’ personal data may be processed for AML
purposes.
b) Obtaining or disclosing the data is expressly laid down in the law. To qualify for this exception,
data Operators must be able to demonstrate how the law in question applies to them, and
requires them to either obtain or disclose the personal data in question. However, the
Operator should make it clear, within the privacy policy, that it obtains or discloses personal
data in accordance with the applicable law, unless there is a legal prohibition preventing the
data controller from doing so.

5.5

Right of access

This right is intended to empower data subjects to be aware of the personal data being processed and
to be able to verify the lawfulness of that processing.
Under the GDPR, data subjects will have the right to obtain:
a) Confirmation that data about them is being processed;
b) A copy of their personal data undergoing processing; and
c) Other supplementary information, including information on appropriate safeguards in place
when transferring data.
Players have a right to request access to their personal data in the gaming industry, when taking into
account that Operators process large quantity of information concerning their clients. Upon receiving
a Subject Access Request (SAR), a B2C licensee should be able to ask the data subject to specify the
information or processing activities to which the request relates. However, if such a subject access
request is not limited, then a B2C licensee must provide such information as required by the GDPR.

For the purposes of facilitating subject access requests, Operators may consider providing data
subjects with remote access to a secure system which would provide the data subjects with direct
access to his or her personal data.
The data subject must be given a reason when the Operator does not intend to comply with the
request and also provided with the necessary information on the possibility to lodge a complaint with
the supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.
The GDPR makes it clear that the right to obtain a copy shall not adversely affect the rights and
freedom of others. Furthermore, Operators can refuse to provide that information which reveals
trade secrets, intellectual property and, in particular, copyright protecting software.

5.6

Right to rectification

The data subject has the right to have inaccurate personal data about him corrected. The data
controller must take every reasonable step to ensure that inaccurate personal data is rectified or
deleted.
Operators must respond to a request for rectification within one month. The data subject must be
given a reason when the Operator does not intend to comply with the request and also provided with
the necessary information on the possibility to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority and
seeking a judicial remedy.

5.7

Right to Data Portability

The newly introduced right to data portability imposes two new obligations on the controller. Upon
data subjects' request, the controller shall:
a) forward to the data subjects the personal data which they have received from the same data
subject, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format; and
b) transmit those data to another data controller, where it is technically feasible to do so.
Controllers should consider having download tools or API setups – data must be transmitted in a
structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. The GDPR encourages controllers to have
interoperable formats, however this is not an obligation to adopt or maintain processing systems
which are technically compatible. In the absence of any format common to the industry, controllers
are to provide the data using commonly-used open formats (e.g. XML, JSON, CSV, etc). Upon selecting
a format, the Operator should consider how this format would impact or hinder the individual’s right
to re-use the data. Controllers should keep in mind, however, that they are prohibited from
establishing barriers to the transmission, even if the request relates to sending over a player’s data to
a competitor. Any potential business risk cannot serve as the basis for a refusal to answer the
portability request, and controllers must seek to transmit the personal data in question in a format
which does not release information covered by trade secrets or intellectual property rights9.
If the data is handled by another party on the data subject’s behalf, the other party is to be considered
a controller, even for the sole purpose of data storage.
This right of the players complements the right of access to their data. If Operators ensure that such
data is stored in an easily accessible manner, then it would be significantly easier, and much less
9

WP29 Guidelines on right to data portability, page 12.

`

Last updated May 2018
burdensome, for them to comply with both rights. However, it should be noted that portability is a
narrower right than subject access. It only applies to:
a) personal data which is processed by automated means, and therefore excludes any paper
records;
b) personal data which the data subject, i.e. the player, has provided to the controller; and
c) only to cases where the basis for processing is consent, or that the data is being processed to
fulfil a contract or steps preparatory to a contract.
In industry terms, data which falls under this rights includes all player data submitted by the player
upon registration, and any data which the player would have passed on to the Operator in the course
of any dealings between the two, or even personal data which has been generated by the Operator
from observation of the player’s activity, such as activity logs and history of website usage. Any history
of self-exclusion or wager, loss or deposit limits should also be considered personal data which can be
transferred by virtue of this right. However, the right does not extend to personal data inferred or
derived by the Operator, for example the results of an algorithmic analysis of the individual’s gaming
behaviour, or a player’s profile kept by the Operator in the context of risk-management and financial
regulations. Neither are Operators obliged to answer a data portability request concerning personal
data processed as part of their obligations to prevent and detect money laundering and financial
crimes, and manipulation of sports competitions, where law dictates such obligations 10.
It must also be noted that data portability must not prejudice any other right held by the player (this
rule applies to all rights in the GDPR). It means that if the data is requested by the player, or a player
requests the Operator to transfer his/her data to another controller, the Operator should not erase
that data from its systems, and the original retention period applying to the data which has just been
transmitted, remains applicable. It therefore follows that the same player may exercise any other
applicable right under the GDPR in relation to that data. Furthermore, data portability right shall not
prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the exercise of this
right shall not be used to delay or refuse any request to erase such data under the GDPR’s right to
erasure.
For example, if a player is undergoing a self-exclusion period, but he/she submits a request to have
his/her data sent over to another operator, in addition to including the self-exclusion data within the
set of data, the operator must remain compliant with its responsible gaming obligations. To this end,
an operator who receives such a request from a player undergoing self-exclusion should ensure that
responsible-gaming professionals within its operation make contact with the player, and refer such
player to responsible-gaming bodies, or problem-gambling treatment facilities, in accordance with the
respective gaming laws.
The right to data portability shall not adversely affect any rights and freedoms of other individuals.
Therefore, if a set of personal data concerns data pertaining to more than one data subject, his/her
right to receive that data should not prejudice the rights enjoyed by the other data subject under the
GDPR. If an Operator were to receive a player’s personal data from another controller, and this
includes data relating to a third person which the player would have provided to the latter, the

Recital 68 of GDPR.

receiving Operator may not use such information to enrich the profile of such a third party data subject
without his knowledge and consent11.
Upon delivery the personal data, the Operator sending the data is responsible for taking all the security
measures needed to ensure not only that personal data is securely transmitted (end-to-end
encryption) to the right destination (by the use of strong authentication measures), but also
continuing to protect the data that remains in their systems. The Operators should assess the risks
linked with data portability and take appropriate risk-mitigation measures, such as authentication
mandate in cases of direct transmission to another data controller12.
It is recommended that all controllers implement tools which enable the respective data subjects
exercising this right to exclude, where relevant, the data of other individuals.
Operators must inform all players of the existence of this new right to portability (i.e. it shall be made
explicit within the privacy policy). It is recommended that this is done at registration stage, when the
player is entering into a contractual relationship with the Operator, and thereby providing personal
data. If the player provides additional data at a later stage, or if the data has been forwarded by
another individual, the Operator must communicate the said right to the player as soon as possible.
Operators should distinguish the precise nature of the data which is subject to this right. It is also
recommended that Operators notify the players of this right upon receiving a request to close the
player account.
Upon receiving a request, Operators are obliged to reply “without undue delay” and in any event
“within one month of receipt of the request.”13 This also includes instances wherein the Operator
denies such a request. In such a case, the Operator is to inform the player with regard to the “reasons
for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and
seeking a judicial remedy.14”
It is not permissible to charge a fee for compliance with such a request, although if an Operator can
demonstrate that the requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, then a fee can be considered.
However, it should be kept in mind that the group of European data protection authorities, the
Working Party ex. Article 29 (in the following "WP29") recognised in its Guidelines that the setting up
of an API facilitates these exchanges, and it is unlikely that any requests would be considered
“excessive”. As a general rule, therefore, Operators should steer clear of seeking to charge any fees in
this regard.
Interestingly, this right is also applicable to players who share gameplay footage. Having said that, it
does not appear this right results in a requirement to retain personal data beyond the usual retention
period, therefore if a platform’s approach is to only stream live play-through footage, and to delete
such footage from the servers once the play-through is complete, then there is no obligation on the
platform to retain the data.

Data processors are contractually obliged to assist controllers “by appropriate technical and
organisational measures” with regard to responding to data portability requests. It is advisable that
processors and controllers consider the setting up of specific procedures in relation to such requests.
It should be noted that WP29 Guidelines stress that if a player makes it clear that he/she is making a
request not under the GDPR, but rather under any other sectorial legislation, such as the Payment
Services Directive 2, then the access should be granted according to such sectorial legislation, and not
the GDPR’s data portability provisions15. It is evident that any interplay between rights would need to
be assessed on a case-by-case basis, however, it is recommended that guidance is sought from the
Operator’s Lead Supervisory Authority in any instances wherein the GDPR’s data portability
requirements conflict with other access and portability requirements or member state legislation.
Operators should not automatically assume that sector-specific legislation automatically displaces any
GDPR right.

5.8

Right to Object

Data subjects have the right to object to:
a) Processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest or
in the exercise of official authority;
b) Direct marketing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such marketing activities;
and
c) Processing for scientific or historical research purposes or for the purpose of statistics.
Following an objection, the controller may no longer process the personal data unless the Operator
demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the
data subject or in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. However, it is the controller who
bears the burden of proof for demonstrating such compelling interests that override the rights of the
data subject and the data subject is therefore not precluded from objecting.
If a player objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, B2C licensees must stop processing the
personal data for such purposes as soon as the objection is received; there are no exemptions or
grounds to refuse. In the case of the use of information society services, the data subject may exercise
his right to object by automated means using technical specifications.
A B2C licensee always has the right to terminate a player’s account (in accordance with the regulations
and procedures mandated by respective gaming laws to which the licensee is subject) in the event
that it would not like to proceed with offering the gaming service once it has received such objections,
particularly in relation to processing based on legitimate interests, if this were to significantly affect
the service it would provide to the particular player in question, or to its customers in general.
The right to object must be clearly brought to the players’ attention. The player is to be informed of
this right at the time of the first communication, and within the B2C licensee’s privacy policy, and this
is to be presented to him/her clearly and separately from any other information.
If any of the processing activities are carried out online, the data subjects must be offered a way in
which to object online.

6 Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
Profiling is a procedure that includes any form of automated processing of personal data which may
involve a series of statistical deductions. It means gathering information about an individual (or group
of individuals) from different sources and evaluating their characteristics or behaviour patterns in
order to place them into a certain category or group to analyse and/or make predictions about, for
example, their ability to perform a task, preferences, interests or likely behaviour.
Automated decision-making has a different scope, and may partially overlap with profiling, but such
decisions can be made with or without profiling, and profiling can take place without making
automated decisions. However, something that starts off as a simple automated decision-making
process could become one based on profiling, depending upon how the data is used.
As a rule, in order to prevent individuals from being subject to decisions taken by machines that could
influence their lives, article 22 of the GDPR prohibits fully automated individual decision-making,
including profiling, that has a legal or similarly significant effect.
Within the gaming industry, an automated-decision is said to have legal effect if, for example, it results
in the player being subjected to surveillance by a competent authority. An automated-decision is said
to similarly significantly affect a data subject if the decision has the potential to significantly influence
the circumstances, behaviour or choices of the individuals concerned.
However, there are exceptions to the rule and notably, Recital 71 of the GDPR specifies that
automated decision making and profiling are allowed where expressly authorized by Union or
Member State law to which the Operator is subject, and this would include fraud, tax evasion and
suspicious betting pattern reporting. However, even though such processing may be mandated by
law, it is highly recommended that Operators dedicate an element of human intervention in making
decisions about players which have a legal or similarly significant effect on the player, such as refusing
him as a player, or reporting him to the Authorities and there should be measures in place to safeguard
the data subject’s rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, for example by informing them within
the privacy policy (as explained in Section 5 above).
If an Operator would still like to proceed with such automated decision making, it could seek a player’s
specific and explicit consent, and this would also serve as an exception from the prohibition.
If an automated process produces what is in effect a recommendation concerning a player, but a
human being within the Operator’s organisation reviews, and takes account of other factors in making
the final decision, then that decision is not ‘based solely’ on automated processing, and is not captured
by the prohibition under Article 2216. It should be noted that if no human has any decision-making
power, irrespective of whether said human is otherwise involved in the decision making process, such
as by scanning decision-relevant documents, the prohibition still applies.

7 The Controller-Processor Relationship
The GDPR imposes a high duty of care upon controllers in selecting their personal data processors.

16

WP 29 Guidelines on Profiling, page 9.

Public

`

Page 18 of 29

Last updated May 2018
The controller should only contract with processors providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in
terms of expert knowledge, reliability and resources to implement technical and organisational
measures that will meet GDPR requirements, including for the security of processing. In other words,
Operators shall only choose processors that comply with the GDPR, or they could risk penalties
themselves. The controller-processor relationship should be governed by a contract or other legal act,
binding the processor to the controller, which, inter alia, sets out the subject-matter and duration of
the processing, the nature and purposes of the processing, the type of personal data and categories
of data subjects, the manner in which the processor will report any data breaches to the controller,
the steps which will be taken by the processor to secure the data, the specific tasks and responsibilities
of the processor and the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Both controllers and
processors must ensure that the contract laying down the terms for their service is in line with the
GDPR.
Gaming Operators, as controllers, must therefore ensure that cloud services providers only process
personal data for the purposes as initially agreed in their controller-processor agreement and as
identified with the data subject.
If the processor wishes to engage another processor, which may be referred to as a “sub-processor”,
the processor must obtain the prior approval of the controller. This applies even if you have a general
consent to sub-contract, so as to give the data controller the opportunity to object. In this case, the
same data protection obligations set out between the controller and the processor must apply to the
relationship between the processor and sub-processor. If the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data
protection obligations, the initial processor remains fully liable to the controller for the performance
of the sub-processor's obligations17. In respect to the relationship between Operator and affiliate, the
latter should be instructed not to engage another processor (i.e.: another sub-affiliate) without prior
specific or general written authorization of the controller - i.e. the Operator. The GDPR allows more
flexibility in appointing sub-affiliates, but such flexibility still requires that Operators must be able to
have at any time a full picture of the data processing activities performed on their behalf
Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they are
considered to be joint controllers. Together, in a transparent manner, they determine their respective
responsibilities for compliance with the GDPR. As detailed below, this could be the case with affiliates,
for example.
Controllers of personal data, and where applicable, the controller's representative, must also maintain
a record of processing activities under their responsibility18. On the other hand, processors of personal
data, and where applicable, the processor's representative, must maintain a record of all categories
of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller. Each controller and processor should be
obliged to cooperate with the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (in the following "IDPC")
and make those records available to it on request.

7.1

Affiliates

Affiliates may be both processors and controllers. Their classification depends on the nature of the
processing which they carry out. It could be said that an affiliate who reaches out to prospective
players and proceeds to provide those customers to an Operator, has complete autonomy over the
processing of the customers’ data, and is hence a controller. When an affiliate solely acts on behalf of
17
18

Article 28(4) GDPR.
Article 30 GDPR.

Public

`

Page 19 of 29

Last updated May 2018
the Operator, by driving traffic towards that Operator, and when such an affiliate would not have
otherwise been processing that data had it not been for his relationship with the Operator, then that
affiliate is acting as a processor. There are situations where affiliates are acting as both controllers and
processors in the course of conducting marketing activities. This may be the case when affiliates
compile their own mailing list and then use it to send promotional material on behalf of operators.
There is also the possibility that the Operator and its affiliate are considered to be joint controllers, if
they are deemed to be jointly determining the purposes and means of processing.
Therefore, in the case of a breach, one would need to determine the precise nature of the processing
being carried out by the affiliate when the breach was made, however, the GDPR introduces liability
for both processors and controllers, thus lessening the impact of determining whether an affiliate is a
controller or a processor. However, the LSA is the body which will ultimately determine the precise
role of an affiliate in coming to a conclusion. It must be reminded that under Malta’s gaming laws and
regulations, both a licensee and a third party carrying out marketing can be found responsible for any
breach, and a breach by a third party carrying out a function on behalf of a licensee may nevertheless
affect the standing of a licensee with the Authority.
To this end, it is being reminded that licensees are to ensure that the contents of their agreements
with affiliates and third parties alike, reflect the responsibilities required by both entities, and demand
compliance with gaming and data protection legislation. Together and in a transparent manner,
Operators and affiliates should determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with gaming
laws and with the GDPR.
The main principles of the matter just examined above, can be summarized as follows:
1. Players can file direct claims for breach of their privacy rights against both Operators and their
gaming affiliates if the breach is the result of the conduct of affiliates.
2. Gaming affiliates' liability arises if they did not comply with the obligations imposed
specifically on them directly by the GDPR, or by the lawful instructions of the Operator, when
acting as processors.
3. Depending on the affiliate model, the operator, the affiliate or both will have the burden of
proof to demonstrate compliance with the data protection law.
4. In case of more than one Operator or affiliate, each of them may be found liable for damages.
5. Gaming affiliates are responsible for the conduct of the sub-affiliates appointed by them (i.e.
of the network of affiliates reporting to a "master" affiliate).

7.2

Security measures

When acting as processors, affiliates are obliged to notify any data breach to the Operator without
undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. However, since Operators are obliged
to notify data breaches to the LSA not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, if an affiliate
is not able to identify and does not notify a data breach to the Operator within less than 72 hours from
its occurrence, it might be considered to be evidence of a lack of compliance with GDPR.
In those cases where an affiliate suffers a data breach in relation to its own records (e.g. marketing
database), for which it is responsible as a data controller, such affiliate shall notify the breach to the
supervisory authority within 72-hours from becoming aware of the breach.

8 Marketing
8.1

Unsolicited marketing

Maltese gaming laws prohibit any Operator from engaging in any activity that involves the sending of
unsolicited commercial communications, whether it is through its own operation or by the
intervention of third parties.

8.2

Solicited Direct Marketing

Operators, and any third party engaged by the operator, are responsible for ensuring that the
processing of data for the purpose of direct marketing is based upon an appropriate legal basis as
required within the GDPR. In the case of marketing communication sent by electronic means, the
processing must comply with the rules of Directive 2002/58/EC (transposed in national law by virtue
of S.L 440.01) which will eventually be superseded by the ePrivacy Regulation. These guidelines
suggest the following set-up19:
The registration screen of every operator, besides requiring registering players to agree to terms and
conditions, should also include a tick-box which enables the said individuals to opt-out of receiving
marketing communications from the same operator, or from any processor processing player data on
the Operator’s behalf for the purposes of sending out any marketing communications. This approach
is commonly referred to as opt-out or soft opt-in. Where the opt-out approach is adopted, the
operator or a processor engaged for such purposes shall only send marketing communication in
relation to similar products or services for which the individual made initial contact.
A separate tick-box seeking the registering player’s opt-in consent is required if the Operator will be
transferring to or sharing that data with any third parties, including to any other data controllers within
the same group of companies, as well as to receive marketing communications from the said third
parties.

8.3

Marketing carried out by third parties, including by affiliates

When engaging affiliates to conduct marketing activities on their behalf, Operators should have in
place a due diligence process, which includes the assessment of their data protection practices, the
consent mechanisms for direct marketing, including documented evidence to prove consents, the
privacy policy and the provision of unsubscribe options. Such procedures shall also be monitored on
an ongoing basis in order to ascertain that the entrusted affiliates are complying with the applicable
data protection laws.
Furthermore, when a communication is sent by an affiliate on behalf of an operator, this should be
made clear to the data subject, and such communication shall facilitate an easy opt-out method.

9 Data Retention
The period for which the personal data is stored should be “limited to a strict minimum.20” The impact
of the GDPR on the retention of personal data is particularly problematic in the gaming industry in
19

Kindly be reminded that the below should not be interpreted to mean that this is the only correct manner in
which this processing can be carried out. Neither is it guaranteed that every supervisory authority will adopt
the same interpretation.

light of legal obligations imposed on gaming Operators by various legal instruments, and separate
rules and obligations. Operators are required to specify “the period for which the personal data will
be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period21” within their privacy
policy. In compliance with the so called “risk based approach” Operators shall be able to justify the
data retention periods that have been determined on the basis of the criteria.
Operators therefore have the obligation to determine the relevant data retention period. There is no
one period which is suitable for all Operators, nor for all players registered with the different
Operators, and the applicable period depends on the type of data which is being processed, and the
purposes for that processing. As general guidance, however, data pertaining to a player who closes
his/her account with a gaming company, and who is not undergoing an indefinite self-exclusion period,
should not be retained beyond the years mandated by applicable AML/CFT legislation, unless there is
justification for doing so. An example of such justification includes the suspicion that such a player has
been involved in organised crime by virtue of his/her gaming activities, while the fact that such a player
has abused of bonus schemes, or was otherwise fraudulent, is not considered as justification for
retaining the data beyond AML/CFT requirements. In order to determine the correct data retention
period only the purposes, not instruments, of the processing must be taken into consideration.
For example, in order to determine the correct data retention period in the case of processing personal
data by e-mail, the Operator shall take into consideration only (i) the categories of personal data; (ii)
the purposes of the processing; (iii) the type of business in which the company operates. The
functionality of the email software (which is precisely a tool and not a purpose) has no legal
significance.
A policy on the retention applicable to different categories of personal data shall be adopted in line
with the principles of the GDPR. The policy shall outline: (i) mandatory retention requirements; (ii)
how and when data should be deleted or anonymised; (iii) the security measures which should be
adopted as part of such activity.
Once the periods are determined, Operators must set up a data management system, made up of
technical and organisational measures which enable the company to comply with other GDPR
obligations in relation to that data, including data minimization, data portability requests, the
management of data breaches, and the right of erasure.
The current EU Data Protection Directive 95/EC/4622 already requires Operators to minimize the
retention of personal data in identifiable form when this is no longer necessary for the purposes for
which the data are collected or processed. The GDPR reiterates this principle23 while also requiring
that personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as it is processed for archiving purposes
in the public interest24, subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational
measures required by the same Regulation.
What this means for B2C Operators in the gaming industry essentially depends on the categories of
personal data which they are processing. Additionally, Operators must ensure that they are only

Article 5(1)(d) GDPR.
24
As well as for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1)
subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation
in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject.

holding data which is relevant and limited to what is necessary. The data should also be subject to
periodic review in order to evaluate whether or not it is still justified to keep that data.
Personal data of players who have had their accounts closed, or who have voluntarily closed their
accounts, and who would be accepted as players by an Operator should they choose to re-register as
players, should be erased or completely anonymised upon the lapse of any retention period mandated
by law, such as anti-money laundering legislation.
For example, a gaming operator holds personal data about its players. This includes details of each
player’s name, surname, date of birth, bank account number. The gaming website uses this
information as part of its security procedures. It is appropriate for the gaming website to retain this
data for as long as the player has an account with the website. After the account has been closed, the
operator may need to continue holding some of this information only for legal or operational reasons,
with the periods and the said reasons included within the privacy policy.

9.1

Right of Erasure

The Right of Erasure, commonly known as the right to be forgotten, is granted to individuals who make
a request to have personal data pertaining to them erased and free from further processing, only in
the following circumstances:
a) the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or
processed;
b) the data subject withdraws consent, and there is no other legal ground for the processing;
c) the data subject objects to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds;
d) the personal data was unlawfully processed;
e) the personal data has to be erased to comply with a legal obligation of the controller; and, or
f) the personal data was collected in relation to the offer of information society services to a
child.
The controller, however, is not bound to comply with a request for erasure if the processing is
necessary:
a) to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
b) to comply with a legal obligation or to perform a task carried out in the public interest or in
the exercise of official authority; and, or
c) to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
Therefore, in line with the above requirements, such requests in relation to, inter alia, data pertaining
to self-excluded players, data retained in order to prevent fraudulent players from re-registering with
a gaming website, or from re-entering a gaming premises, data maintained in relation to sportsbetting integrity cases, or data maintained in order to fulfil an obligation maintained by any other law,
such as money-laundering legislation, should generally not be entertained This is without prejudice to
the data retention period determined on the basis of the criteria as explained above...
However, it is the Operator’s duty to erase that data whenever none of the above circumstances
remain applicable. Furthermore, a request for erasure which cannot be upheld, should lead to a reexamination of the relevant player’s profile, and any data which is unnecessary should be anonymised,
pseudonymised or de-identified.

For example, in case of impracticable deletion, alternative interventions could be envisaged, such as:
(i) access to copies only in cases of emergency and restoration; (ii) preservation of supports,
appropriately encrypted.

10 The Cross-Border Processing of Personal Data, within, and outside,
the EU/EEA
10.1

Intra-Group Transfers of Personal Data within the EEA

The free exchange of personal data between Member States is a fundamental aspect of the EU’s basic
principles. This principle is also reflected in the GDPR, which excludes the restriction or prohibition of
the free movement of personal data within the EU or EEA. In the case of intra-group data transfers,
therefore, no other particular restrictions apply. That said, data transfers between different group
members require a legal basis and thus are regarded as any other transmission or disclosure under
this point of view.
The GDPR also recognises that controllers forming part of a group of companies can have a justified
interest in transferring personal data within their group for internal administration purposes, including
the processing of personal data of players and employees. So, even though there is no kind of "intragroup privilege" under the GDPR, intra-group data processing is in any case facilitated to a certain
extent. Some of the organisational and material requirements can be implemented in a simplified
manner by the group entities. On the other hand, group entities face enforced data protection
obligations if the processing activities of different controllers are linked, as this will require a careful
allocation of responsibilities.

10.2

Transfer of Personal Data outside the EEA

The GDPR imposes restrictions on cross-border processing of personal data to non-EU countries or
international organisations to guarantee the data subject’s adequate protection over his/her personal
data.
As a general rule, transfers of player data to a country outside the EU may take place where such a
country has been designated as one which ensures an adequate level of protection, i.e. Adequate
Jurisdictions25. In summary, entities must verify in a two-step approach that this processing activity is
covered by a legal basis and that appropriate safeguards will be applied to such transfer. These
safeguards, under the GDPR, shall provide for conditions for onward transfers that shall help to keep
up an appropriate level of data protection similar to the one under the GDPR in case of such transfers.
There are a number of instances, however, where data is to be processed outside the EU/EEA and
where no ‘adequacy decision’ has been reached. This is equally applicable for the processing of data
by cloud service providers, among others. In such cases, licensees transferring personal data to such
countries must have the appropriate safeguards in place.
a) Model data protection clauses: At the time of publication of these Guidelines, the Commission
has issued two sets of contractual clauses for data transfers from data controllers in the EU to
data controllers established outside the EU/EEA, and for data transfers from controllers in the
25

At the time of publication, The European Commission has so far recognised Andorra, Argentina, Canada
(commercial organisations), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland,
Uruguay and the US (limited to the Privacy Shield framework) as providing adequate protection.

EU to processors established outside the EU.EEA. These clauses are available for download
from the EU Commission’s website26. The use of the model clauses does not prevent
Operators or processors from adding to these clauses, provided that there is no contradiction
between the clauses. Therefore, the GDPR does not tolerate any standard format data
processing agreements. Operators are obliged to renegotiate the data processing
agreements. Indeed, GDPR provides for a detailed list of instructions that have to be contained
in the relevant agreement.
b) Binding Corporate Rules ("BCRs"): where a member of the corporate group of a licensee is
itself established outside the EU/EEA, and outside a country subject to an Adequacy Decision,
the BCRs allow the transfer of personal data internationally within the same corporate group
while ensuring that all data transfers are safe. The BCRs must contain: (i)privacy principles,
such as transparency, data quality, security; (ii) tools of effectiveness (such as audit, training,
or complaint handling systems); and (iii) an element proving that the rules are binding. Such
BCRs are to be drafted by the licensee, meet the requirements set up in the working papers
adopted by the WP29 and submitted to the Lead Supervisory Authority for review and
comments. Once the BCRs have been considered as final by all the Data Protection Authorities,
the licensee shall request authorisation of transfers on the basis of the adopted rules by each
national Data Protection Authority. The BCRs, inter alia, define the group members’ global
privacy policy with regard to the international transfers of personal data to those group
members located in third countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection.
Concluding, in line with CJEU's jurisprudence27, Article 45 Section 2 of the GDPR lays down the relevant
criteria for an adequacy decision such as the third country's data protection legislation,
implementation and supervision and its international commitments. Not all of the criteria have to be
equally fulfilled, as an adequate level of data protection needs to be established by way of an overall
assessment of the specific circumstances. In case of a positive outcome of such assessment, the
European Commission may adopt an adequacy decision by way of an implementing act that shall
provide for a mechanism of periodic review, specify its scope of application and, where applicable, the
third country's Supervisory Authorities.

10.3

Determining a Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA)

Since Operators are established in more than one EU/EEA Member State and consequently conducting
cross border processing, Operators should identify the location of their main establishment, since the
data protection authority within the said location shall be the competent authority to act as the Lead
Supervisory Authority (LSA) for the purposes of Article 56 of the GDPR. For Operators whose main
establishment is set in Malta, their LSA would be the IDPC.
The main establishment can be determined as either the place of its central administration in the
Union, or else in the jurisdiction where decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of
personal data are taken. In considering the latter, the establishment would need to have the power
to have such decisions implemented in order to be able to be considered as the main establishment.
Likewise, with regard to processors, the place of central administration shall be the processor’s main
establishment, however if the processor does not have a central administration, the establishment

which carries out its main processing activities in the context of its activities shall be determined as
the main establishment.
It is not unlikely that a licensee finds itself having two LSAs, in light of the fact that there could be two
main establishments identified by the licensee as establishments wherein decisions on the purposes
and means of the processing of personal data are taken. It is advised, however, that in such instances
licensees categorise and identify the data processing being undertaken in each establishment, and
hence the nature of the processing falling under the respective remits of the separate LSAs, so as not
to have more than one LSA supervising the same set of data processing, thus nullifying the benefits
ensued by the one-stop-shop mechanism. As stated by Article 29 Working Party28 the GDPR does not
permit "forum shopping": there must be an effective and real exercise of management activity in the
member state identified as the organisation's main establishment. Organisations should be able to
demonstrate to the LSA where decisions about data processing are actually taken and implemented,
as they may be asked to prove their position. Furthermore, it should be noted that controllers without
an establishment in the EU cannot benefit from the abovementioned one-stop-shop mechanism, but
rather must deal with local supervisory authorities in every Member State they are active in, through
their local representative.

11 Data Protection Officers
Every B2C gaming Operator must designate a DPO, since as a core activity, B2C Operators monitor
individuals systematically and on a large scale. B2B Operators are not specifically required to appoint
a DPO29, but some may find it useful to do so on a voluntary basis.
Notably, it is highly likely than affiliates must also appoint a DPO, since here too, as a core activity,
there is a possibility that the affiliate is monitoring individuals systematically and on a large scale.
The role of the DPO may be held either by in-house employee, who knows the operational reality in
which the processing take place and may also be outsourced, so long as he/she is designated on the
basis of professional qualities, including expert knowledge of data protection law and practices, and
the ability to fulfil the tasks laid down in Article 39 of the GDPR. A DPO may carry out more than one
role within a controller’s organisation, however, it is imperative that the individual designated as DPO
is not simultaneously undertaking any role which could be deemed to be conflicting with that of a
DPO, such as the role of an MLRO, HR development manager or marketing analyst. In any case, it is
recommended to have a clear allocation of tasks within the DPO team, identifying only one natural
person able to act as a point of contact with the data subjects and the Supervisory Authority.
A group of companies which are in possession of a corporate group licence30 may appoint a single DPO
provided that he/she is “easily accessible from each establishment31”. The DPO must be easily
accessible by data subjects and the respective supervisory authority, as well as internally within the
organisation.

For example, an optimal solution of the fulfilment of “accessibility”, required by Art. 37 par.2 of the
GDPR could be represented by the usage of a multi-language telephone helpline or online portals,
exclusively dedicated to privacy requests or complaints, if any.
It must be noted that DPOs are not themselves personally responsible in case of non-compliance with
the GDPR, but it is the controller and/or the processor who is required to ensure and demonstrate
that processing is being carried out in line with the GDPR. It must be noted that, DPOs and individuals
carrying out DPO tasks are not allowed to be penalized or dismissed for their performance in executing
the proper requirements of the GDPR.
In such cases, Articles 37-39 of the GDPR will become applicable to such organisation, as though the
appointment of a DPO had been mandatory. Otherwise, such companies may opt to employ staff, or
appoint external consultants, in order to handle data protection issues, without being themselves
designated as a DPO. In fact, in such cases, it should be made clear that the title of such employee or
consultant is not DPO.
For example, a good organisation that prevents conflicts of interests, could be represented by a
privacy team composed by: (i) a Privacy Expert that monitors the compliance of the company with the
GDPR, and who can report to the management, in case of major privacy issues; (ii) several Privacy
Stewards within the relevant function/department that verify the correct use of the personal data and
report to the Privacy Expert in case of issues relating to privacy. In any case, it is recommended to
have a clear allocation of tasks within the privacy team.
Upon appointing a DPO, whether or not that DPO is an employee of the organisation,
controllers/processors must ensure that the relevant DPO is given sufficient autonomy and resources
to carry out the task effectively (e.g. budget on annual basis to improve technical and organisational
measures and/or training modules on privacy matter related). It must also be noted that the DPO is
bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of his/her tasks.
In order to ensure that the DPO is accessible - whether internal or external - the DPOs contact details
(i.e. information allowing data subjects and authorities to reach the DPO in an easy way) must always
be available, and updated. Such details must also be communicated to the relevant supervisory
authorities, and to the Malta Gaming Authority, and to the employees of the organisation. It is not
necessary that the name of the DPO is communicated to the data subjects by virtue of publication on
the gaming website, or within the gaming premises. It is up to the data controller or data processor to
assess whether, depending on the specific circumstances, it may constitute useful or necessary
information.

12 Accountability, Transparency and Good Governance
Operators are expected to establish comprehensive yet proportionate governance measures that take
into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and
freedoms of data subjects. This includes the implementation of appropriate data protection policies
as well as appropriate staff training, and internal audits of processing activities. These measures are
intended to minimise the risk of breaches and ensure the protection of personal data. Although most
organisations already have good governance measures in place, these new requirements necessitate
the review of these policies and the addition of new procedures as required.

Furthermore, in relation to the affiliates status, it is important to note that the review of conformity
with GDPR of such gaming affiliates will become an obligation to be periodically performed. If an
affiliate is not able to ensure privacy compliance, Operators will be obliged to either terminate the
relationship with it or take the risk of potential liabilities, as explained in Section 6 above.

12.1

Data Mapping and Data Ledgers

The GDPR places an increased emphasis on proving compliance with data protection rules. Gaming
Operators will be required to maintain a record of data processing activities, associated policies and
procedures. Unless this is already in place, Operators should create and maintain a detailed inventory
of personal data.
Without such an inventory, it is difficult for Operators to make informed choices on key strategic
decisions relating to GDPR compliance.
The GDPR further requires that gaming affiliates commit to make available to the controller all
information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its privacy obligations and allow for and
contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Operator or another auditor mandated
by the Operator.
This obligation is reinforced by the need for gaming affiliates to keep a record of all categories of
processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller. Therefore, a gaming affiliate that might
process personal data on behalf of several Operators, shall keep a separate record of the categories
of processing activities carried out by each of his Operators.

12.2

Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)

DPIAs constitute the process of systematically identifying potential privacy issues before they arise, to
evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that risk, and devise a way to
mitigate it. This may also involve discussions with the relevant parties or stakeholders. This process
may prove invaluable in determining the viability of future projects and initiatives, particularly with
regards to new technologies.
Where a type of data processing is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of
individuals, the GDPR requires that the controller in question carries out a DPIA prior to the processing
of the data, in order to assess the impact of the envisaged processing on the protection of the data.
The IDPC will be publishing a list of risky processing in terms of Article 35(4) of the GDPR.
If a DPIA carried out by a controller indicates that an envisaged processing would result in a high risk
in the absence of risk-mitigating measures taken by the controller, the controller shall consult the SA
prior to the processing. The obligations to carry out DPIAs and consult with SAs in relation to high-risk
processing operations directly apply to controllers only. But processors should assist controllers,
where necessary and upon request, in complying with these obligations.

12.3

Adherence to Codes of Conduct

Codes of Conduct are a means for specific industry sectors, or groups of organisations, to create
sector-specific rules on the processing of personal data to improve overall compliance with EU data
protection law. Draft Codes of Conduct must be submitted to the IDPC, or any data protection
supervisory authority, for formal approval. Such Codes represent an important component of

Public

`

broadening and adapting the tools for data protection compliance that controllers and processors can
draw on, by way of a "semi self-regulating" mechanism.
Codes of Conduct not only help by providing guidance on specific compliance issues, but they also
provide evidence of compliance with the GDPR and can be listed as a positive factor in a DPIA.
Non-EU/EEA organisations can adhere to approved Codes of Conduct as a lawful basis for cross-border
data transfers. This may also simplify compliance obligations for organisations that frequently
exchange data with other organisations in the same industry. Such adherence to Codes can
demonstrate that non EU/EEA data importers (controllers as well as processors) have implemented
adequate safeguards in order to permit transfers under Article 46 of the GDPR; transfers made on the
basis of an approved code of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the
importer to apply appropriate safeguards may take place without any specific authorization from a
supervisory authority and Codes may therefore offer an alternative mechanism for managing
international transfers, standing on the same level as Standard Contractual Clauses.
Licensees are also encouraged to register for seal and certification schemes to obtain formal
recognition of compliance with all, or a particular aspect, of EU data protection law. Guidelines will be
issued by the WP29. That said, certification is voluntary. The competent supervisory authority will
approve criteria for a common certification, the so called European Data Protection Seal.
