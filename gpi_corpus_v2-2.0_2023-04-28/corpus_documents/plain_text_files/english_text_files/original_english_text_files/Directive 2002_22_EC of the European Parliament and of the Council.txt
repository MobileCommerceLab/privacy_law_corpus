DIRECTIVE 2002/22/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 7 March 2002
on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and
services (Universal Service Directive)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND
COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

service obligation it wishes to maintain. Such
obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive
per se, provided they are administered in a transparent,
non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner
and are not more burdensome than necessary for the
kind of universal service defined by the member.

THE

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European
Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social
Committee (2),

(4)

Ensuring universal service (that is to say, the provision
of a defined minimum set of services to all end-users at
an affordable price) may involve the provision of some
services to some end-users at prices that depart from
those resulting from normal market conditions.
However, compensating undertakings designated to
provide such services in such circumstances need not
result in any distortion of competition, provided that
designated undertakings are compensated for the
specific net cost involved and provided that the net cost
burden is recovered in a competitively neutral way.

(5)

In a competitive market, certain obligations should
apply to all undertakings providing publicly available
telephone services at fixed locations and others should
apply only to undertakings enjoying significant market
power or which have been designated as a universal
service operator.

(6)

The network termination point represents a boundary
for regulatory purposes between the regulatory
framework for electronic communication networks and
services and the regulation of telecommunication
terminal equipment. Defining the location of the
network termination point is the responsibility of the
national regulatory authority, where necessary on the
basis of a proposal by the relevant undertakings.

(7)

Member States should continue to ensure that the
services set out in Chapter II are made available with
the quality specified to all end-users in their territory,
irrespective of their geographical location, and, in the
light of specific national conditions, at an affordable
price. Member States may, in the context of universal
service obligations and in the light of national
conditions, take specific measures for consumers in
rural or geographically isolated areas to ensure their
access to the services set out in the Chapter II and the
affordability of those services, as well as ensure under

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the
Regions (3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article
251 of the Treaty (4),
Whereas:
(1)

The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector and
increasing competition and choice for communications
services go hand in hand with parallel action to create a
harmonised regulatory framework which secures the
delivery of universal service. The concept of universal
service should evolve to reflect advances in technology,
market developments and changes in user demand. The
regulatory framework established for the full
liberalisation of the telecommunications market in 1998
in the Community defined the minimum scope of
universal service obligations and established rules for its
costing and financing.

(2)

Under Article 153 of the Treaty, the Community is to
contribute to the protection of consumers.

(3)

The Community and its Member States have undertaken
commitments on the regulatory framework of
telecommunications networks and services in the
context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)
agreement on basic telecommunications. Any member
of the WTO has the right to define the kind of universal

may be included in any net cost calculation of universal
service obligations.

the same conditions this access, in particular for the
elderly, the disabled and for people with special social
needs. Such measures may also include measures
directly targeted at consumers with special social needs
providing support to identified consumers, for example
by means of specific measures, taken after the
examination of individual requests, such as the paying
off of debts.

(8)

A fundamental requirement of universal service is to
provide users on request with a connection to the
public telephone network at a fixed location, at an
affordable price. The requirement is limited to a single
narrowband network connection, the provision of
which may be restricted by Member States to the
end-user's primary location/residence, and does not
extend to the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
which provides two or more connections capable of
being used simultaneously. There should be no
constraints on the technical means by which the
connection is provided, allowing for wired or wireless
technologies, nor any constraints on which operators
provide part or all of universal service obligations.
Connections to the public telephone network at a fixed
location should be capable of supporting speech and
data communications at rates sufficient for access to
online services such as those provided via the public
Internet. The speed of Internet access experienced by a
given user may depend on a number of factors
including the provider(s) of Internet connectivity as well
as the given application for which a connection is being
used. The data rate that can be supported by a single
narrowband connection to the public telephone network
depends on the capabilities of the subscriber's terminal
equipment as well as the connection. For this reason it
is not appropriate to mandate a specific data or bit rate
at Community level. Currently available voice band
modems typically offer a data rate of 56 kbit/s and
employ automatic data rate adaptation to cater for
variable line quality, with the result that the achieved
data rate may be lower than 56 kbit/s. Flexibility is
required on the one hand to allow Member States to
take measures where necessary to ensure that
connections are capable of supporting such a data rate,
and on the other hand to allow Member States where
relevant to permit data rates below this upper limit of
56 kbits/s in order, for example, to exploit the
capabilities of wireless technologies (including cellular
wireless networks) to deliver universal service to a
higher proportion of the population. This may be of
particular importance in some accession countries
where household penetration of traditional telephone
connections remains relatively low. In specific cases
where the connection to the public telephony network
at a fixed location is clearly insufficient to support
satisfactory Internet access, Member States should be
able to require the connection to be brought up to the
level enjoyed by the majority of subscribers so that it
supports data rates sufficient for access to the Internet.
Where such specific measures produce a net cost
burden for those consumers concerned, the net effect

24.4.2002

(9)

The provisions of this Directive do not preclude
Member States from designating different undertakings
to provide the network and service elements of
universal service. Designated undertakings providing
network elements may be required to ensure such
construction and maintenance as are necessary and
proportionate to meet all reasonable requests for
connection at a fixed location to the public telephone
network and for access to publicly available telephone
services at a fixed location.

(10)

Affordable price means a price defined by Member
States at national level in the light of specific national
conditions, and may involve setting common tariffs
irrespective of location or special tariff options to deal
with the needs of low-income users. Affordability for
individual consumers is related to their ability to
monitor and control their expenditure.

(11)

Directory information and a directory enquiry service
constitute an essential access tool for publicly available
telephone services and form part of the universal service
obligation. Users and consumers desire comprehensive
directories and a directory enquiry service covering all
listed telephone subscribers and their numbers
(including fixed and mobile numbers) and want this
information to be presented in a non-preferential
fashion. Directive 97/66/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 15 December 1997 concerning
the processing of personal data and the protection of
privacy in the telecommunications sector (1) ensures the
subscribers' right to privacy with regard to the inclusion
of their personal information in a public directory.

(12)

For the citizen, it is important for there to be adequate
provision of public pay telephones, and for users to be
able to call emergency telephone numbers and, in
particular, the single European emergency call number
(112) free of charge from any telephone, including
public pay telephones, without the use of any means of

(1) OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 1.

and choice provide more possibilities for all or part of
the universal service obligations to be provided by
undertakings other than those with significant market
power. Therefore, universal service obligations could in
some cases be allocated to operators demonstrating the
most cost-effective means of delivering access and
services, including by competitive or comparative
selection procedures. Corresponding obligations could
be included as conditions in authorisations to provide
publicly available services.

payment. Insufficient information about the existence of
112 deprives citizens of the additional safety ensured
by the existence of this number at European level
especially during their travel in other Member States.

(13)

(14)

Member States should take suitable measures in order to
guarantee access to and affordability of all publicly
available telephone services at a fixed location for
disabled users and users with special social needs.
Specific measures for disabled users could include, as
appropriate, making available accessible public
telephones, public text telephones or equivalent
measures for deaf or speech-impaired people, providing
services such as directory enquiry services or equivalent
measures free of charge for blind or partially sighted
people, and providing itemised bills in alternative
format on request for blind or partially sighted people.
Specific measures may also need to be taken to enable
disabled users and users with special social needs to
access emergency services 112 and to give them a
similar possibility to choose between different operators
or service providers as other consumers. Quality of
service standards have been developed for a range of
parameters to assess the quality of services received by
subscribers and how well undertakings designated with
universal service obligations perform in achieving these
standards. Quality of service standards do not yet exist
in respect of disabled users. Performance standards and
relevant parameters should be developed for disabled
users and are provided for in Article 11 of this
Directive. Moreover, national regulatory authorities
should be enabled to require publication of quality of
service performance data if and when such standards
and parameters are developed. The provider of universal
service should not take measures to prevent users from
benefiting fully from services offered by different
operators or service providers, in combination with its
own services offered as part of universal service.

The importance of access to and use of the public
telephone network at a fixed location is such that it
should be available to anyone reasonably requesting it.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is for
Member States to decide on the basis of objective
criteria which undertakings have universal service
obligations for the purposes of this Directive, where
appropriate taking into account the ability and the
willingness of undertakings to accept all or part of the
universal service obligations. It is important that
universal service obligations are fulfilled in the most
efficient fashion so that users generally pay prices that
correspond to efficient cost provision. It is likewise
important that universal service operators maintain the
integrity of the network as well as service continuity
and quality. The development of greater competition

L 108/53

(15)

Member States should monitor the situation of
consumers with respect to their use of publicly available
telephone services and in particular with respect to
affordability. The affordability of telephone service is
related to the information which users receive regarding
telephone usage expenses as well as the relative cost of
telephone usage compared to other services, and is also
related to their ability to control expenditure.
Affordability therefore means giving power to
consumers
through
obligations
imposed
on
undertakings designated as having universal service
obligations. These obligations include a specified level of
itemised billing, the possibility for consumers selectively
to block certain calls (such as high-priced calls to
premium services), the possibility for consumers to
control expenditure via pre-payment means and the
possibility for consumers to offset up-front connection
fees. Such measures may need to be reviewed and
changed in the light of market developments. Current
conditions do not warrant a requirement for operators
with universal service obligations to alert subscribers
where a predetermined limit of expenditure is exceeded
or an abnormal calling pattern occurs. Review of the
relevant legislative provisions in future should consider
whether there is a possible need to alert subscribers for
these reasons.

(16)

Except in cases of persistent late payment or
non-payment of bills, consumers should be protected
from immediate disconnection from the network on the
grounds of an unpaid bill and, particularly in the case of
disputes over high bills for premium rate services,
should continue to have access to essential telephone
services pending resolution of the dispute. Member
States may decide that such access may continue to be
provided only if the subscriber continues to pay line
rental charges.

(17)

Quality and price are key factors in a competitive
market and national regulatory authorities should be
able to monitor achieved quality of service for
undertakings which have been designated as having
universal service obligations. In relation to the quality of
service attained by such undertakings, national

L 108/54

obligations and not to other activities which are not
directly linked to the provision of the universal service
obligations. Recovery mechanisms should in all cases
respect the principles of Community law, and in
particular in the case of sharing mechanisms those of
non-discrimination and proportionality. Any funding
mechanism should ensure that users in one Member
State do not contribute to universal service costs in
another Member State, for example when making calls
from one Member State to another.

regulatory authorities should be able to take appropriate
measures where they deem it necessary. National
regulatory authorities should also be able to monitor the
achieved quality of services of other undertakings
providing public telephone networks and/or publicly
available telephone services to users at fixed locations.

(18)

Member States should, where necessary, establish
mechanisms for financing the net cost of universal
service obligations in cases where it is demonstrated
that the obligations can only be provided at a loss or at
a net cost which falls outside normal commercial
standards. It is important to ensure that the net cost of
universal service obligations is properly calculated and
that any financing is undertaken with minimum
distortion to the market and to undertakings, and is
compatible with the provisions of Articles 87 and 88 of
the Treaty.

(19)

Any calculation of the net cost of universal service
should take due account of costs and revenues, as well
as the intangible benefits resulting from providing
universal service, but should not hinder the general aim
of ensuring that pricing structures reflect costs. Any net
costs of universal service obligations should be
calculated on the basis of transparent procedures.

(20)

Taking into account intangible benefits means that an
estimate in monetary terms, of the indirect benefits that
an undertaking derives by virtue of its position as
provider of universal service, should be deducted from
the direct net cost of universal service obligations in
order to determine the overall cost burden.

(21)

When a universal service obligation represents an unfair
burden on an undertaking, it is appropriate to allow
Member States to establish mechanisms for efficiently
recovering net costs. Recovery via public funds
constitutes one method of recovering the net costs of
universal service obligations. It is also reasonable for
established net costs to be recovered from all users in a
transparent fashion by means of levies on undertakings.
Member States should be able to finance the net costs of
different elements of universal service through different
mechanisms, and/or to finance the net costs of some or
all elements from either of the mechanisms or a
combination of both. In the case of cost recovery by
means of levies on undertakings, Member States should
ensure that that the method of allocation amongst them
is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria
and is in accordance with the principle of
proportionality. This principle does not prevent Member
States from exempting new entrants which have not yet
achieved any significant market presence. Any funding
mechanism should ensure that market participants only
contribute to the financing of universal service

24.4.2002

(22)

Where Member States decide to finance the net cost of
universal service obligations from public funds, this
should be understood to comprise funding from general
government budgets including other public financing
sources such as state lotteries.

(23)

The net cost of universal service obligations may be
shared between all or certain specified classes of
undertaking. Member States should ensure that the
sharing mechanism respects the principles of
transparency, least market distortion, non-discrimination
and proportionality. Least market distortion means that
contributions should be recovered in a way that as far
as possible minimises the impact of the financial burden
falling on end-users, for example by spreading
contributions as widely as possible.

(24)

National regulatory authorities should satisfy themselves
that those undertakings benefiting from universal service
funding provide a sufficient level of detail of the specific
elements requiring such funding in order to justify their
request. Member States' schemes for the costing and
financing of universal service obligations should be
communicated to the Commission for verification of
compatibility with the Treaty. There are incentives for
designated operators to raise the assessed net cost of
universal service obligations. Therefore Member States
should ensure effective transparency and control of
amounts charged to finance universal service
obligations.

(25)

Communications markets continue to evolve in terms of
the services used and the technical means used to
deliver them to users. The universal service obligations,
which are defined at a Community level, should be
periodically reviewed with a view to proposing that the
scope be changed or redefined. Such a review should
take account of evolving social, commercial and
technological conditions and the fact that any change of
scope should be subject to the twin test of services that
become available to a substantial majority of the

24.4.2002

EN

Official Journal of the European Communities

population, with a consequent risk of social exclusion
for those who can not afford them. Care should be
taken in any change of the scope of universal service
obligations to ensure that certain technological choices
are not artificially promoted above others, that a
disproportionate financial burden is not imposed on
sector undertakings (thereby endangering market
developments and innovation) and that any financing
burden does not fall unfairly on consumers with lower
incomes. Any change of scope automatically means that
any net cost can be financed via the methods permitted
in this Directive. Member States are not permitted to
impose on market players financial contributions which
relate to measures which are not part of universal
service obligations. Individual Member States remain
free to impose special measures (outside the scope of
universal service obligations) and finance them in
conformity with Community law but not by means of
contributions from market players.

(26)

More effective competition across all access and service
markets will give greater choice for users. The extent of
effective competition and choice varies across the
Community and varies within Member States between
geographical areas and between access and service
markets. Some users may be entirely dependent on the
provision of access and services by an undertaking with
significant market power. In general, for reasons of
efficiency and to encourage effective competition, it is
important that the services provided by an undertaking
with significant market power reflect costs. For reasons
of efficiency and social reasons, end-user tariffs should
reflect demand conditions as well as cost conditions,
provided that this does not result in distortions of
competition. There is a risk that an undertaking with
significant market power may act in various ways to
inhibit entry or distort competition, for example by
charging excessive prices, setting predatory prices,
compulsory bundling of retail services or showing
undue preference to certain customers. Therefore,
national regulatory authorities should have powers to
impose, as a last resort and after due consideration,
retail regulation on an undertaking with significant
market power. Price cap regulation, geographical
averaging or similar instruments, as well as
non-regulatory measures such as publicly available
comparisons of retail tariffs, may be used to achieve the
twin objectives of promoting effective competition
whilst pursuing public interest needs, such as
maintaining the affordability of publicly available
telephone services for some consumers. Access to
appropriate cost accounting information is necessary, in
order for national regulatory authorities to fulfil their
regulatory duties in this area, including the imposition
of any tariff controls. However, regulatory controls on
retail services should only be imposed where national
regulatory authorities consider that relevant wholesale
measures or measures regarding carrier selection or

L 108/55

pre-selection would fail to achieve the objective of
ensuring effective competition and public interest.

(27)

Where a national regulatory authority imposes
obligations to implement a cost accounting system in
order to support price controls, it may itself undertake
an annual audit to ensure compliance with that cost
accounting system, provided that it has the necessary
qualified staff, or it may require the audit to be carried
out by another qualified body, independent of the
operator concerned.

(28)

It is considered necessary to ensure the continued
application of the existing provisions relating to the
minimum set of leased line services in Community
telecommunications legislation, in particular in Council
Directive 92/44/EEC of 5 June 1992 on the application
of open network provision to leased lines (1), until such
time as national regulatory authorities determine, in
accordance with the market analysis procedures laid
down in Directive 2002/21/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a
common regulatory framework for electronic
communications networks and services (Framework
Directive) (2), that such provisions are no longer needed
because a sufficiently competitive market has developed
in their territory. The degree of competition is likely to
vary between different markets of leased lines in the
minimum set, and in different parts of the territory. In
undertaking the market analysis, national regulatory
authorities should make separate assessments for each
market of leased lines in the minimum set, taking into
account their geographic dimension. Leased lines
services constitute mandatory services to be provided
without recourse to any compensation mechanisms. The
provision of leased lines outside of the minimum set of
leased lines should be covered by general retail
regulatory provisions rather than specific requirements
covering the supply of the minimum set.

(29)

National regulatory authorities may also, in the light of
an analysis of the relevant market, require mobile
operators with significant market power to enable their
subscribers to access the services of any interconnected
provider of publicly available telephone services on a
call-by-call basis or by means of pre-selection.

Contracts are an important tool for users and
consumers to ensure a minimum level of transparency
of information and legal security. Most service providers
in a competitive environment will conclude contracts
with their customers for reasons of commercial
desirability. In addition to the provisions of this
Directive, the requirements of existing Community
consumer protection legislation relating to contracts, in
particular Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993
on unfair terms in consumer contracts (1) and Directive
97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 20 May 1997 on the protection of consumers in
respect of distance contracts (2), apply to consumer
transactions relating to electronic networks and services.
Specifically, consumers should enjoy a minimum level
of legal certainty in respect of their contractual relations
with their direct telephone service provider, such that
the contractual terms, conditions, quality of service,
condition for termination of the contract and the
service, compensation measures and dispute resolution
are specified in their contracts. Where service providers
other than direct telephone service providers conclude
contracts with consumers, the same information should
be included in those contracts as well. The measures to
ensure transparency on prices, tariffs, terms and
conditions will increase the ability of consumers to
optimise their choices and thus to benefit fully from
competition.

(33)

It is desirable to enable consumers to achieve the fullest
connectivity possible to digital television sets.
Interoperability is an evolving concept in dynamic
markets. Standards bodies should do their utmost to
ensure that appropriate standards evolve along with the
technologies concerned. It is likewise important to
ensure that connectors are available on television sets
that are capable of passing all the necessary elements of
a digital signal, including the audio and video streams,
conditional access information, service information,
application program interface (API) information and
copy protection information. This Directive therefore
ensures that the functionality of the open interface for
digital television sets is not limited by network
operators, service providers or equipment manufacturers
and continues to evolve in line with technological
developments. For display and presentation of digital
interactive television services, the realisation of a
common standard through a market-driven mechanism
is recognised as a consumer benefit. Member States and
the Commission may take policy initiatives, consistent
with the Treaty, to encourage this development.

(34)

All end-users should continue to enjoy access to
operator assistance services whatever organisation
provides access to the public telephone network.

End-users should have access to publicly available
information on communications services. Member States
should be able to monitor the quality of services which
are offered in their territories. National regulatory
authorities should be able systematically to collect
information on the quality of services offered in their
territories on the basis of criteria which allow
comparability between service providers and between
Member States. Undertakings providing communications
services, operating in a competitive environment, are
likely to make adequate and up-to-date information on
their services publicly available for reasons of
commercial advantage. National regulatory authorities
should nonetheless be able to require publication of
such information where it is demonstrated that such
information is not effectively available to the public.

(35)

The provision of directory enquiry services and
directories is already open to competition. The
provisions of this Directive complement the provisions
of Directive 97/66/EC by giving subscribers a right to
have their personal data included in a printed or
electronic directory. All service providers which assign
telephone numbers to their subscribers are obliged to
make relevant information available in a fair,
cost-oriented and non-discriminatory manner.

(36)

It is important that users should be able to call the
single European emergency number 112, and any other
national emergency telephone numbers, free of charge,
from any telephone, including public pay telephones,
without the use of any means of payment. Member
States should have already made the necessary
organisational arrangements best suited to the national
organisation of the emergency systems, in order to
ensure that calls to this number are adequately answered
and handled. Caller location information, to be made
available to the emergency services, will improve the
level of protection and the security of users of 112
services and assist the emergency services, to the extent
technically feasible, in the discharge of their duties,
provided that the transfer of calls and associated data to
the emergency services concerned is guaranteed. The
reception and use of such information should comply
with relevant Community law on the processing of
personal data. Steady information technology

End-users should be able to enjoy a guarantee of
interoperability in respect of all equipment sold in the
Community for the reception of digital television.
Member States should be able to require minimum
harmonised standards in respect of such equipment.
Such standards could be adapted from time to time in
the light of technological and market developments.

improvements
will

support
the
simultaneous handling of several languages over the
networks at a reasonable cost. This in turn will ensure
additional safety for European citizens using the 112
emergency call number.

(39)

Easy access to international telephone services is vital
for European citizens and European businesses. 00 has
already been established as the standard international
telephone access code for the Community. Special
arrangements for making calls between adjacent
locations across borders between Member States may be
established or continued. The ITU has assigned, in
accordance with ITU Recommendation E.164, code
3883 to the European Telephony Numbering Space
(ETNS). In order to ensure connection of calls to the
ETNS, undertakings operating public telephone
networks should ensure that calls using 3883 are
directly or indirectly interconnected to ETNS serving
networks specified in the relevant European
Telecommunications
Standards
Institute
(ETSI)
standards. Such interconnection arrangements should be
governed by the provisions of Directive 2002/19/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March
2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic
communications networks and associated facilities
(Access Directive) (1).

Access by end-users to all numbering resources in the
Community is a vital pre-condition for a single market.
It should include freephone, premium rate, and other
non-geographic numbers, except where the called
subscriber has chosen, for commercial reasons, to limit
access from certain geographical areas. Tariffs charged
to parties calling from outside the Member State
concerned need not be the same as for those parties
calling from inside that Member State.

Tone dialling and calling line identification facilities are
normally available on modern telephone exchanges and
can therefore increasingly be provided at little or no
expense. Tone dialling is increasingly being used for
user interaction with special services and facilities,
including value added services, and the absence of this
facility can prevent the user from making use of these
services. Member States are not required to impose
obligations to provide these facilities when they are
already available. Directive 97/66/EC safeguards the
privacy of users with regard to itemised billing, by
giving them the means to protect their right to privacy
when calling line identification is implemented. The
development of these services on a pan-European basis
would benefit consumers and is encouraged by this
Directive.

L 108/57

(40)

Number portability is a key facilitator of consumer
choice and effective competition in a competitive
telecommunications environment such that end-users
who so request should be able to retain their number(s)
on the public telephone network independently of the
organisation providing service. The provision of this
facility between connections to the public telephone
network at fixed and non-fixed locations is not covered
by this Directive. However, Member States may apply
provisions for porting numbers between networks
providing services at a fixed location and mobile
networks.

(41)

The impact of number portability is considerably
strengthened when there is transparent tariff
information, both for end-users who port their numbers
and also for end-users who call those who have ported
their numbers. National regulatory authorities should,
where feasible, facilitate appropriate tariff transparency
as part of the implementation of number portability.

(42)

When ensuring that pricing for interconnection related
to the provision of number portability is cost-oriented,
national regulatory authorities may also take account of
prices available in comparable markets.

(43)

Currently, Member States impose certain must carry
obligations on networks for the distribution of radio or
television broadcasts to the public. Member States
should be able to lay down proportionate obligations on
undertakings under their jurisdiction, in the interest of
legitimate public policy considerations, but such
obligations should only be imposed where they are
necessary to meet general interest objectives clearly
defined by Member States in conformity with
Community law and should be proportionate,
transparent and subject to periodical review. Must carry
obligations imposed by Member States should be
reasonable, that is they should be proportionate and
transparent in the light of clearly defined general
interest objectives, and could, where appropriate, entail
a provision for proportionate remuneration. Such must
carry obligations may include the transmission of
services specifically designed to enable appropriate
access by disabled users.

(44)

Networks used for the distribution of radio or television
broadcasts to the public include cable, satellite and
terrestrial broadcasting networks. They might also
include other networks to the extent that a significant
number of end-users use such networks as their
principal means to receive radio and television
broadcasts.

L 108/58

EN

Official Journal of the European Communities

(45)

Services providing content such as the offer for sale of a
package of sound or television broadcasting content are
not covered by the common regulatory framework for
electronic communications networks and services.
Providers of such services should not be subject to
universal service obligations in respect of these
activities. This Directive is without prejudice to
measures taken at national level, in compliance with
Community law, in respect of such services.

(46)

Where a Member State seeks to ensure the provision of
other specific services throughout its national territory,
such obligations should be implemented on a cost
efficient basis and outside the scope of universal service
obligations. Accordingly, Member States may undertake
additional measures (such as facilitating the
development of infrastructure or services in
circumstances where the market does not satisfactorily
address the requirements of end-users or consumers), in
conformity with Community law. As a reaction to the
Commission's e-Europe initiative, the Lisbon European
Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 called on Member
States to ensure that all schools have access to the
Internet and to multimedia resources.

(47)

In the context of a competitive environment, the views
of interested parties, including users and consumers,
should be taken into account by national regulatory
authorities when dealing with issues related to
end-users' rights. Effective procedures should be
available to deal with disputes between consumers, on
the one hand, and undertakings providing publicly
available communications services, on the other.
Member States should take full account of Commission
Recommendation 98/257/EC of 30 March 1998 on the
principles applicable to the bodies responsible for
out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes (1).

24.4.2002

(51)

Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely
setting a common level of universal service for
telecommunications for all European users and of
harmonising conditions for access to and use of public
telephone networks at a fixed location and related
publicly available telephone services and also achieving
a harmonised framework for the regulation of electronic
communications services, electronic communications
networks and associated facilities, cannot be sufficiently
achieved by the Member States and can therefore by
reason of the scale or effects of the action be better
achieved at Community level, the Community may
adopt measures in accordance with the principles of
subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In
accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set
out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond
what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(52)

The measures necessary for the implementation of this
Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council
Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down
the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers
conferred on the Commission (2),

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

CHAPTER I

SCOPE, AIMS AND DEFINITIONS

Article 1
(48)

(49)

(50)

Co-regulation could be an appropriate way of
stimulating enhanced quality standards and improved
service performance. Co-regulation should be guided by
the same principles as formal regulation, i.e. it should
be objective, justified, proportional, non-discriminatory
and transparent.

This Directive should provide for elements of consumer
protection, including clear contract terms and dispute
resolution, and tariff transparency for consumers. It
should also encourage the extension of such benefits to
other categories of end-users, in particular small and
medium-sized enterprises.

The provisions of this Directive do not prevent a
Member State from taking measures justified on
grounds set out in Articles 30 and 46 of the Treaty, and
in particular on grounds of public security, public policy
and public morality.

(1) OJ L 115, 17.4.1998, p. 31.

Scope and aims
1.
Within the framework of Directive 2002/21/EC
(Framework Directive), this Directive concerns the provision of
electronic communications networks and services to end-users.
The aim is to ensure the availability throughout the
Community of good quality publicly available services through
effective competition and choice and to deal with
circumstances in which the needs of end-users are not
satisfactorily met by the market.
2.
This Directive establishes the rights of end-users and the
corresponding obligations on undertakings providing publicly
available electronic communications networks and services.
With regard to ensuring provision of universal service within
an environment of open and competitive markets, this
Directive defines the minimum set of services of specified
quality to which all end-users have access, at an affordable
(2) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.

24.4.2002

Official Journal of the European Communities

price in the light of specific national conditions, without
distorting competition. This Directive also sets out obligations
with regard to the provision of certain mandatory services
such as the retail provision of leased lines.

L 108/59

It includes inter alia mobile, freephone and premium rate
numbers.

24.4.2002

Article 8
Designation of undertakings

1.
Member States may designate one or more undertakings
to guarantee the provision of universal service as identified in
Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 and, where applicable, Article 9(2) so
that the whole of the national territory can be covered.
Member States may designate different undertakings or sets of
undertakings to provide different elements of universal service
and/or to cover different parts of the national territory.

2.
When Member States designate undertakings in part or
all of the national territory as having universal service
obligations, they shall do so using an efficient, objective,
transparent and non-discriminatory designation mechanism,
whereby no undertaking is a priori excluded from being
designated. Such designation methods shall ensure that
universal service is provided in a cost-effective manner and
may be used as a means of determining the net cost of the
universal service obligation in accordance with Article 12.

Article 9
Affordability of tariffs

2.
A Member State shall ensure that its national regulatory
authority can decide not to impose obligations under
paragraph 1 in all or part of its territory, if it is satisfied that
these facilities or comparable services are widely available, on
the basis of a consultation of interested parties as referred to in
Article 33.
3.
Member States shall ensure that it is possible to make
emergency calls from public pay telephones using the single
European emergency call number 112 and other national
emergency numbers, all free of charge and without having to
use any means of payment.

Article 7
Special measures for disabled users
1.
Member States shall, where appropriate, take specific
measures for disabled end-users in order to ensure access to
and affordability of publicly available telephone services,
including access to emergency services, directory enquiry
services and directories, equivalent to that enjoyed by other
end-users.
2.
Member States may take specific measures, in the light of
national conditions, to ensure that disabled end-users can also
take advantage of the choice of undertakings and service
providers available to the majority of end-users.

1.
National regulatory authorities shall monitor the
evolution and level of retail tariffs of the services identified in
Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 as falling under the universal service
obligations and provided by designated undertakings, in
particular in relation to national consumer prices and income.

2.
Member States may, in the light of national conditions,
require that designated undertakings provide tariff options or
packages to consumers which depart from those provided
under normal commercial conditions, in particular to ensure
that those on low incomes or with special social needs are not
prevented from accessing or using the publicly available
telephone service.

3.
Member States may, besides any provision for designated
undertakings to provide special tariff options or to comply
with price caps or geographical averaging or other similar
schemes, ensure that support is provided to consumers
identified as having low incomes or special social needs.

4.
Member States may require undertakings with obligations
under Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 to apply common tariffs,
including geographical averaging, throughout the territory, in
the light of national conditions or to comply with price caps.

5.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where a
designated undertaking has an obligation to provide special

24.4.2002

Official Journal of the European Communities

EN

tariff options, common tariffs, including geographical
averaging, or to comply with price caps, the conditions are
fully transparent and are published and applied in accordance
with the principle of non-discrimination. National regulatory
authorities may require that specific schemes be modified or
withdrawn.

Article 10
Control of expenditure

1.
Member States shall ensure that designated undertakings,
in providing facilities and services additional to those referred
to in Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9(2), establish terms and
conditions in such a way that the subscriber is not obliged to
pay for facilities or services which are not necessary or not
required for the service requested.

2.
Member States shall ensure that designated undertakings
with obligations under Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9(2) provide the
specific facilities and services set out in Annex I, Part A, in
order that subscribers can monitor and control expenditure
and avoid unwarranted disconnection of service.

3.
Member States shall ensure that the relevant authority is
able to waive the requirements of paragraph 2 in all or part of
its national territory if it is satisfied that the facility is widely
available.

Article 11

L 108/61

3.
National regulatory authorities may, in addition, specify
the content, form and manner of information to be published,
in order to ensure that end-users and consumers have access
to comprehensive, comparable and user-friendly information.
4.
National regulatory authorities shall be able to set
performance targets for those undertakings with universal
service obligations at least under Article 4. In so doing,
national regulatory authorities shall take account of views of
interested parties, in particular as referred to in Article 33.
5.
Member States shall ensure that national regulatory
authorities are able to monitor compliance with these
performance targets by designated undertakings.
6.
Persistent failure by an undertaking to meet performance
targets may result in specific measures being taken in
accordance with Directive 2002/20/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the
authorisation of electronic communications networks and
services (Authorisation Directive) (1). National regulatory
authorities shall be able to order independent audits or similar
reviews of the performance data, paid for by the undertaking
concerned, in order to ensure the accuracy and comparability
of the data made available by undertakings with universal
service obligations.

Article 12
Costing of universal service obligations
1.
Where national regulatory authorities consider that the
provision of universal service as set out in Articles 3 to 10
may represent an unfair burden on undertakings designated to
provide universal service, they shall calculate the net costs of
its provision.

Quality of service of designated undertakings
For that purpose, national regulatory authorities shall:
1.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that all
designated undertakings with obligations under Articles 4, 5,
6, 7 and 9(2) publish adequate and up-to-date information
concerning their performance in the provision of universal
service, based on the quality of service parameters, definitions
and measurement methods set out in Annex III. The published
information shall also be supplied to the national regulatory
authority.

2.
National regulatory authorities may specify, inter alia,
additional quality of service standards, where relevant
parameters have been developed, to assess the performance of
undertakings in the provision of services to disabled end-users
and disabled consumers. National regulatory authorities shall
ensure that information concerning the performance of
undertakings in relation to these parameters is also published
and made available to the national regulatory authority.

(a) calculate the net cost of the universal service obligation,
taking into account any market benefit which accrues to
an undertaking designated to provide universal service, in
accordance with Annex IV, Part A; or
(b) make use of the net costs of providing universal service
identified by a designation mechanism in accordance with
Article 8(2).
2.
The accounts and/or other information serving as the
basis for the calculation of the net cost of universal service
obligations under paragraph 1(a) shall be audited or verified by
(1) See page 21 of this Official Journal.

L 108/62

Official Journal of the European Communities

EN

the national regulatory authority or a body independent of the
relevant parties and approved by the national regulatory
authority. The results of the cost calculation and the
conclusions of the audit shall be publicly available.

Article 13

2.
Subject to Community and national rules on business
confidentiality, national regulatory authorities shall ensure that
an annual report is published giving the calculated cost of
universal service obligations, identifying the contributions
made by all the undertakings involved, and identifying any
market benefits, that may have accrued to the undertaking(s)
designated to provide universal service, where a fund is
actually in place and working.

Financing of universal service obligations
1.
Where, on the basis of the net cost calculation referred
to in Article 12, national regulatory authorities find that an
undertaking is subject to an unfair burden, Member States
shall, upon request from a designated undertaking, decide:
(a) to introduce a mechanism to compensate that undertaking
for the determined net costs under transparent conditions
from public funds; and/or
(b) to share the net cost of universal service obligations
between providers of electronic communications networks
and services.
2.
Where the net cost is shared under paragraph 1(b),
Member States shall establish a sharing mechanism
administered by the national regulatory authority or a body
independent from the beneficiaries under the supervision of
the national regulatory authority. Only the net cost, as
determined in accordance with Article 12, of the obligations
laid down in Articles 3 to 10 may be financed.

Article 15
Review of the scope of universal service
1.
The Commission shall periodically review the scope of
universal service, in particular with a view to proposing to the
European Parliament and the Council that the scope be
changed or redefined. A review shall be carried out, on the
first occasion within two years after the date of application
referred to in Article 38(1), second subparagraph, and
subsequently every three years.
2.
This review shall be undertaken in the light of social,
economic and technological developments, taking into
account, inter alia, mobility and data rates in the light of the
prevailing technologies used by the majority of subscribers.
The review process shall be undertaken in accordance with
Annex V. The Commission shall submit a report to the
European Parliament and the Council regarding the outcome
of the review.

CHAPTER III

3.
A sharing mechanism shall respect the principles of
transparency, least market distortion, non-discrimination and
proportionality, in accordance with the principles of Annex IV,
Part B. Member States may choose not to require contributions
from undertakings whose national turnover is less than a set
limit.
4.
Any charges related to the sharing of the cost of
universal service obligations shall be unbundled and identified
separately for each undertaking. Such charges shall not be
imposed or collected from undertakings that are not providing
services in the territory of the Member State that has
established the sharing mechanism.

Article 14

REGULATORY CONTROLS ON UNDERTAKINGS WITH
SIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER IN SPECIFIC MARKETS

Article 16
Review of obligations
1.

Member States shall maintain all obligations relating to:

(a) retail tariffs for the provision of access to and use of the
public telephone network, imposed under Article 17 of
Directive 98/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 26 February 1998 on the application of open
network provision (ONP) to voice telephony and on
universal service for telecommunications in a competitive
environment (1);

Transparency
1.
Where a mechanism for sharing the net cost of universal
service obligations as referred to in Article 13 is established,
national regulatory authorities shall ensure that the principles
for cost sharing, and details of the mechanism used, are
publicly available.

(b) carrier selection or pre-selection, imposed under Directive
97/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of
30

service and interoperability through application of the
principles of open network provision (ONP) (1);
(c) leased lines, imposed under Articles 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 of
Directive 92/44/EEC,
until a review has been carried out and a determination made
in accordance with the procedure in paragraph 3 of this
Article.
2.
The Commission shall indicate relevant markets for the
obligations relating to retail markets in the initial
recommendation on relevant product and service markets and
the Decision identifying transnational markets to be adopted in
accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/21/EC
(Framework Directive).
3.
Member States shall ensure that, as soon as possible after
the entry into force of this Directive, and periodically
thereafter, national regulatory authorities undertake a market
analysis, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article
16 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) to
determine whether to maintain, amend or withdraw the
obligations relating to retail markets. Measures taken shall be
subject to the procedure referred to in Article 7 of Directive
2002/21/EC (Framework Directive).

L 108/63

and justified in the light of the objectives laid down in Article
8 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). The
obligations imposed may include requirements that the
identified undertakings do not charge excessive prices, inhibit
market entry or restrict competition by setting predatory
prices, show undue preference to specific end-users or
unreasonably bundle services. National regulatory authorities
may apply to such undertakings appropriate retail price cap
measures, measures to control individual tariffs, or measures to
orient tariffs towards costs or prices on comparable markets,
in order to protect end-user interests whilst promoting
effective competition.

3.
National regulatory authorities shall, on request, submit
information to the Commission concerning the retail controls
applied and, where appropriate, the cost accounting systems
used by the undertakings concerned.

4.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where
an undertaking is subject to retail tariff regulation or other
relevant retail controls, the necessary and appropriate cost
accounting systems are implemented. National regulatory
authorities may specify the format and accounting
methodology to be used. Compliance with the cost accounting
system shall be verified by a qualified independent body.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that a statement
concerning compliance is published annually.

Article 17
Regulatory controls on retail services
1.

Member States shall ensure that, where:

(a) as a result of a market analysis carried out in accordance
with Article 16(3) a national regulatory authority
determines that a given retail market identified in
accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/21/EC
(Framework Directive) is not effectively competitive, and
(b) the national regulatory authority concludes that obligations
imposed under Directive 2002/19/EC (Access Directive), or
Article 19 of this Directive would not result in the
achievement of the objectives set out in Article 8 of
Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive),
national regulatory authorities shall impose appropriate
regulatory obligations on undertakings identified as having
significant market power on a given retail market in
accordance with Article 14 of Directive 2002/21/EC
(Framework Directive).
2.
Obligations imposed under paragraph 1 shall be based
on the nature of the problem identified and be proportionate

98/61/EC (OJ L 268, 3.10.1998, p. 37).

5.
Without prejudice to Article 9(2) and Article 10, national
regulatory authorities shall not apply retail control mechanisms
under paragraph 1 of this Article to geographical or user
markets where they are satisfied that there is effective
competition.

Article 18

Regulatory controls on the minimum set of leased lines

1.
Where, as a result of the market analysis carried out in
accordance with Article 16(3), a national regulatory authority
determines that the market for the provision of part or all of
the minimum set of leased lines is not effectively competitive,
it shall identify undertakings with significant market power in
the provision of those specific elements of the minimum set of
leased lines services in all or part of its territory in accordance
with Article 14 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework
Directive). The national regulatory authority shall impose
obligations regarding the provision of the minimum set of
leased lines, as identified in the list of standards published in
the Official Journal of the European Communities in accordance
with Article 17 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework
Directive), and the conditions for such provision set out in

L 108/64

Official Journal of the European Communities

Annex VII to this Directive, on such undertakings in relation
to those specific leased line markets.

24.4.2002
CHAPTER IV

END-USER INTERESTS AND RIGHTS

2.
Where as a result of the market analysis carried out in
accordance with Article 16(3), a national regulatory authority
determines that a relevant market for the provision of leased
lines in the minimum set is effectively competitive, it shall
withdraw the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 in relation
to this specific leased line market.

3.
The minimum set of leased lines with harmonised
characteristics, and associated standards, shall be published in
the Official Journal of the European Communities as part of the
list of standards referred to in Article 17 of Directive
2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). The Commission may
adopt amendments necessary to adapt the minimum set of
leased lines to new technical developments and to changes in
market demand, including the possible deletion of certain
types of leased line from the minimum set, acting in
accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 37(2) of
this Directive.

Article 20
Contracts
1.
Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 apply without prejudice to
Community rules on consumer protection, in particular
Directives 97/7/EC and 93/13/EC, and national rules in
conformity with Community law.
2.
Member States shall ensure that, where subscribing to
services providing connection and/or access to the public
telephone network, consumers have a right to a contract with
an undertaking or undertakings providing such services. The
contract shall specify at least:
(a) the identity and address of the supplier;

Article 19
Carrier selection and carrier pre-selection

(b) services provided, the service quality levels offered, as well
as the time for the initial connection;
(c) the types of maintenance service offered;

1.
National regulatory authorities shall require undertakings
notified as having significant market power for the provision
of connection to and use of the public telephone network at a
fixed location in accordance with Article 16(3) to enable their
subscribers to access the services of any interconnected
provider of publicly available telephone services:

(d) particulars of prices and tariffs and the means by which
up-to-date information on all applicable tariffs and
maintenance charges may be obtained;

(a) on a call-by-call basis by dialling a carrier selection code;
and

(f) any compensation and the refund arrangements which
apply if contracted service quality levels are not met; and

(b) by means of pre-selection, with a facility to override any
pre-selected choice on a call-by-call basis by dialling a
carrier selection code.

(e) the duration of the contract, the conditions for renewal
and termination of services and of the contract;

(g) the method of initiating procedures for settlement of
disputes in accordance with Article 34.
Member States may extend these obligations to cover other
end-users.

2.
User requirements for these facilities to be implemented
on other networks or in other ways shall be assessed in
accordance with the market analysis procedure laid down in
Article 16 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) and
implemented in accordance with Article 12 of Directive
2002/19/EC (Access Directive).

3.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that pricing
for access and interconnection related to the provision of the
facilities in paragraph 1 is cost oriented and that direct charges
to subscribers, if any, do not act as a disincentive for the use
of these facilities.

3.
Where contracts are concluded between consumers and
electronic communications services providers other than those
providing connection and/or access to the public telephone
network, the information in paragraph 2 shall also be included
in such contracts. Member States may extend this obligation to
cover other end-users.
4.
Subscribers shall have a right to withdraw from their
contracts without penalty upon notice of proposed
modifications in the contractual conditions. Subscribers shall
be given adequate notice, not shorter than one month, ahead

24.4.2002

Article 24
Interoperability of consumer digital television equipment
In accordance with the provisions of Annex VI, Member States
shall ensure the interoperability of the consumer digital
television equipment referred to therein.

Transparency and publication of information
1.
Member States shall ensure that transparent and
up-to-date information on applicable prices and tariffs, and on
standard terms and conditions, in respect of access to and use
of publicly available telephone services is available to end-users
and consumers, in accordance with the provisions of Annex II.
2.
National regulatory authorities shall encourage the
provision of information to enable end-users, as far as
appropriate, and consumers to make an independent
evaluation of the cost of alternative usage patterns, by means
of, for instance, interactive guides.

Article 22
Quality of service
1.
Member States shall ensure that national regulatory
authorities are, after taking account of the views of interested
parties, able to require undertakings that provide publicly
available electronic communications services to publish
comparable, adequate and up-to-date information for end-users
on the quality of their services. The information shall, on
request, also be supplied to the national regulatory authority in
advance of its publication.
2.
National regulatory authorities may specify, inter alia, the
quality of service parameters to be measured, and the content,
form and manner of information to be published, in order to
ensure that end-users have access to comprehensive,
comparable and user-friendly information. Where appropriate,
the parameters, definitions and measurement methods given in
Annex III could be used.

Article 25
Operator assistance and directory enquiry services

ANNEX I
DESCRIPTION OF FACILITIES AND SERVICES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 10 (CONTROL OF
EXPENDITURE) AND ARTICLE 29 (ADDITIONAL FACILITIES)

Part A: Facilities and services referred to in Article 10
(a) Itemised billing
Member States are to ensure that national regulatory authorities, subject to the requirements of relevant legislation
on the protection of personal data and privacy, may lay down the basic level of itemised bills which are to be
provided by designated undertakings (as established in Article 8) to consumers free of charge in order that they
can:
(i) allow verification and control of the charges incurred in using the public telephone network at a fixed location
and/or related publicly available telephone services, and
(ii) adequately monitor their usage and expenditure and thereby exercise a reasonable degree of control over their
bills.
Where appropriate, additional levels of detail may be offered to subscribers at reasonable tariffs or at no charge.
Calls which are free of charge to the calling subscriber, including calls to helplines, are not to be identified in the
calling subscriber's itemised bill.
(b) Selective call barring for outgoing calls, free of charge
I.e. the facility whereby the subscriber can, on request to the telephone service provider, bar outgoing calls of
defined types or to defined types of numbers free of charge.
(c) Pre-payment systems
Member States are to ensure that national regulatory authorities may require designated undertakings to provide
means for consumers to pay for access to the public telephone network and use of publicly available telephone
services on pre-paid terms.
(d) Phased payment of connection fees
Member States are to ensure that national regulatory authorities may require designated undertakings to allow
consumers to pay for connection to the public telephone network on the basis of payments phased over time.
(e) Non-payment of bills
Member States are to authorise specified measures, which are to be proportionate, non-discriminatory and
published, to cover non-payment of telephone bills for use of the public telephone network at fixed locations.
These measures are to ensure that due warning of any consequent service interruption or disconnection is given to
the subscriber beforehand. Except in cases of fraud, persistent late payment or non-payment, these measures are to
ensure, as far as is technically feasible, that any service interruption is confined to the service concerned.
Disconnection for non-payment of bills should take place only after due warning is given to the subscriber.
Member States may allow a period of limited service prior to complete disconnection, during which only calls that
do not incur a charge to the subscriber (e.g. 112 calls) are permitted.

Part B: List of facilities referred to in Article 29
(a) Tone dialling or DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency operation)
I.e. the public telephone network supports the use of DTMF tones as defined in ETSI ETR 207 for end-to-end
signalling throughout the network both within a Member State and between Member States.

L 108/69

L 108/70

EN

Official Journal of the European Communities

(b) Calling-line identification
I.e. the calling party's number is presented to the called party prior to the call being established.
This facility should be provided in accordance with relevant legislation on protection of personal data and privacy,
in particular Directive 97/66/EC.
To the extent technically feasible, operators should provide data and signals to facilitate the offering of calling-line
identity and tone dialling across Member State boundaries.

ANNEX IV
CALCULATING THE NET COST, IF ANY, OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND ESTABLISHING
ANY RECOVERY OR SHARING MECHANISM IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 12 AND 13
Part A: Calculation of net cost
Universal service obligations refer to those obligations placed upon an undertaking by a Member State which concern
the provision of a network and service throughout a specified geographical area, including, where required, averaged
prices in that geographical area for the provision of that service or provision of specific tariff options for consumers
with low incomes or with special social needs.
National regulatory authorities are to consider all means to ensure appropriate incentives for undertakings (designated
or not) to provide universal service obligations cost efficiently. In undertaking a calculation exercise, the net cost of
universal service obligations is to be calculated as the difference between the net cost for a designated undertaking of
operating with the universal service obligations and operating without the universal service obligations. This applies
whether the network in a particular Member State is fully developed or is still undergoing development and expansion.
Due attention is to be given to correctly assessing the costs that any designated undertaking would have chosen to
avoid had there been no universal service obligation. The net cost calculation should assess the benefits, including
intangible benefits, to the universal service operator.
The calculation is to be based upon the costs attributable to:
(i) elements of the identified services which can only be provided at a loss or provided under cost conditions falling
outside normal commercial standards.
This category may include service elements such as access to emergency telephone services, provision of certain
public pay telephones, provision of certain services or equipment for disabled people, etc;
(ii) specific end-users or groups of end-users who, taking into account the cost of providing the specified network and
service, the revenue generated and any geographical averaging of prices imposed by the Member State, can only be
served at a loss or under cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards.
This category includes those end-users or groups of end-users which would not be served by a commercial
operator which did not have an obligation to provide universal service.
The calculation of the net cost of specific aspects of universal service obligations is to be made separately and so as to
avoid the double counting of any direct or indirect benefits and costs. The overall net cost of universal service
obligations to any undertaking is to be calculated as the sum of the net costs arising from the specific components of
universal service obligations, taking account of any intangible benefits. The responsibility for verifying the net cost lies
with the national regulatory authority.
Part B: Recovery of any net costs of universal service obligations
The recovery or financing of any net costs of universal service obligations requires designated undertakings with
universal service obligations to be compensated for the services they provide under non-commercial conditions.
Because such a compensation involves financial transfers, Member States are to ensure that these are undertaken in an
objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate manner. This means that the transfers result in the least
distortion to competition and to user demand.
In accordance with Article 13(3), a sharing mechanism based on a fund should use a transparent and neutral means for
collecting contributions that avoids the danger of a double imposition of contributions falling on both outputs and
inputs of undertakings.
The independent body administering the fund is to be responsible for collecting contributions from undertakings which
are assessed as liable to contribute to the net cost of universal service obligations in the Member State and is to oversee
the transfer of sums due and/or administrative payments to the undertakings entitled to receive payments from the
fund.

ANNEX V
PROCESS FOR REVIEWING THE SCOPE OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 15
In considering whether a review of the scope of universal service obligations should be undertaken, the Commission is
to take into consideration the following elements:
 social and market developments in terms of the services used by consumers,
 social and market developments in terms of the availability and choice of services to consumers,
 technological developments in terms of the way services are provided to consumers.
In considering whether the scope of universal service obligations be changed or redefined, the Commission is to take
into consideration the following elements:
 are specific services available to and used by a majority of consumers and does the lack of availability or non-use
by a minority of consumers result in social exclusion, and
 does the availability and use of specific services convey a general net benefit to all consumers such that public
intervention is warranted in circumstances where the specific services are not provided to the public under normal
commercial circumstances?

ANNEX VI
INTEROPERABILITY OF DIGITAL CONSUMER EQUIPMENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 24
1. The common scrambling algorithm and free-to-air reception
All consumer equipment intended for the reception of digital television signals, for sale or rent or otherwise made
available in the Community, capable of descrambling digital television signals, is to possess the capability to:
 allow the descrambling of such signals according to the common European scrambling algorithm as
administered by a recognised European standards organisation, currently ETSI;
 display signals that have been transmitted in clear provided that, in the event that such equipment is rented,
the rentee is in compliance with the relevant rental agreement.
2. Interoperability for analogue and digital television sets
Any analogue television set with an integral screen of visible diagonal greater than 42 cm which is put on the
market for sale or rent in the Community is to be fitted with at least one open interface socket, as standardised by
a recognised European standards organisation, e.g. as given in the CENELEC EN 50 049-1:1997 standard,
permitting simple connection of peripherals, especially additional decoders and digital receivers.
Any digital television set with an integral screen of visible diagonal greater than 30 cm which is put on the market
for sale or rent in the Community is to be fitted with at least one open interface socket (either standardised by, or
conforming to a standard adopted by, a recognised European standards organisation, or conforming to an
industry-wide specification) e.g. the DVB common interface connector, permitting simple connection of
peripherals, and able to pass all the elements of a digital television signal, including information relating to
interactive and conditionally accessed services.

ANNEX VII
CONDITIONS FOR THE MINIMUM SET OF LEASED LINES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 18
Note: In accordance with the procedure in Article 18, provision of the minimum set of leased lines under the
conditions established by Directive 92/44/EC should continue until such time as the national regulatory
authority determines that there is effective competition in the relevant leased lines market.
National regulatory authorities are to ensure that provision of the minimum set of leased lines referred to in Article 18
follows the basic principles of non-discrimination, cost orientation and transparency.

1.

Non discrimination
National regulatory authorities are to ensure that the organisations identified as having significant market power
pursuant to Article 18(1) adhere to the principle of non-discrimination when providing leased lines referred to
in Article 18. Those organisations are to apply similar conditions in similar circumstances to organisations
providing similar services, and are to provide leased lines to others under the same conditions and of the same
quality as they provide for their own services, or those of their subsidiaries or partners, where applicable.

2.

Cost orientation
National regulatory authorities are, where appropriate, to ensure that tariffs for leased lines referred to in Article
18 follow the basic principles of cost orientation.
To this end, national regulatory authorities are to ensure that undertakings identified as having significant
market power pursuant to Article 18(1) formulate and put in practice a suitable cost accounting system.
National regulatory authorities are to keep available, with an adequate level of detail, information on the cost
accounting systems applied by such undertakings. They are to submit this information to the Commission on
request.

3.

Transparency
National regulatory authorities are to ensure that the following information in respect of the minimum set of
leased lines referred to in Article 18 is published in an easily accessible form.

3.1.

Technical characteristics, including the physical and electrical characteristics as well as the detailed technical and
performance specifications which apply at the network termination point.

3.2.

Tariffs, including the initial connection charges, the periodic rental charges and other charges. Where tariffs are
differentiated, this must be indicated.
Where, in response to a particular request, an organisation identified as having significant market power
pursuant to Article 18(1) considers it unreasonable to provide a leased line in the minimum set under its
published tariffs and supply conditions, it must seek the agreement of the national regulatory authority to vary
those conditions in that case.

3.3.

Supply conditions, including at least the following elements:
 information concerning the ordering procedure,
 the typical delivery period, which is the period, counted from the date when the user has made a firm
request for a leased line, in which 95 % of all leased lines of the same type have been put through to the
customers.
This period will be established on the basis of the actual delivery periods of leased lines during a recent
time interval of reasonable duration. The calculation must not include cases where late delivery periods
were requested by users,

24.4.2002

24.4.2002

EN

Official Journal of the European Communities

 the contractual period, which includes the period which is in general laid down in the contract and the
minimum contractual period which the user is obliged to accept,
 the typical repair time, which is the period, counted from the time when a failure message has been given
to the responsible unit within the undertaking identified as having significant market power pursuant to
Article 18(1) up to the moment in which 80 % of all leased lines of the same type have been re-established
and in appropriate cases notified back in operation to the users. Where different classes of quality of repair
are offered for the same type of leased lines, the different typical repair times shall be published,
 any refund procedure.
In addition where a Member State considers that the achieved performance for the provision of the minimum
set of leased lines does not meet users' needs, it may define appropriate targets for the supply conditions listed
above.
