Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment
Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life
(759/2004; amendments up to 347/2019 included)

By decision of Parliament, the following is enacted:
Chapter 1
General provisions
Section 1
Purpose of the Act

The purpose of this Act is to promote the protection of privacy and other fundamental
rights safeguarding the protection of privacy in working life.
Section 2
Scope of application

This Act lays down provisions on the processing of personal data concerning employees,
the performance of tests and examinations on employees and the related requirements,
technical surveillance in the workplace, and retrieving and opening employees’ electronic
mail messages.

The provisions of this Act concerning employees also apply to civil servants and any
persons in a civil service relationship or comparable service relationship subject to public
law, and, as appropriate, to job applicants.

In addition to what is provided in this Act, regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing
Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter Data Protection
Regulation, contains provisions regarding the processing of employees’ personal data.

2(18)

Unless otherwise provided in this Act, the provisions of the Data Protection Act
(1050/2018) shall also apply to the processing of personal data. Part VI of the Act on
Electronic Communications Services (917/2014) contains provisions regarding the
confidentiality of communications and the protection of privacy. (347/2019)

The employee’s obligation to undergo a health examination is governed by separate
provisions.
Chapter 2
General preconditions for processing personal data

Section 3
Necessity requirement

The employer is only allowed to process personal data directly necessary for the
employee’s employment relationship, which is connected with managing the rights and
obligations of the parties to the employment relationship or with the benefits provided by
the employer for the employee or which arises from the special nature of the work
concerned.
No exceptions can be made to the necessity requirement, even with the employee’s
consent.
Section 4 (347/2019)
General preconditions for collecting personal data concerning employees and the
employer's duty to provide information

The employer shall collect personal data concerning the employee primarily from the
employee himself or herself. In order to collect personal data from elsewhere, the
employer must obtain the consent of the employee. However, this consent is not required
when an authority discloses information to the employer to enable the latter to fulfil a
statutory duty, or if it is expressly separately provided by law on collecting or obtaining
data. The Security Clearance Act (726/2014) contains provisions regarding requests for

3(18)

security clearance. The Act on Checking the Criminal Background of Persons Working
with Children (504/2002) contains provisions laying out the procedure to be followed when
checking the criminal background of persons appointed to work with minors. Provisions on
the right to obtain data from the criminal records are laid down in the Criminal Records Act
(770/1993).

The employer shall notify the employee in advance that data concerning the employee will
be collected in order to establish his or her reliability. If the employer acquires personal
credit data on an employee, the employer must also notify the employee of the register
from which the credit data are obtained. If data concerning the employee has been
collected from a source other than the employee himself or herself, the employer must
notify the employee of this data before it is used in making decisions concerning the
employee. Chapter III of the Data Protection Regulation contains provisions regarding the
obligation of the controller to provide information to the data subject and regarding the right
of access by the data subject.
The collection of personal data during recruitment and during an employment relationship
is governed by the co-operation procedure referred to in the Act on Co-operation within
Undertakings (334/2007), the Act on Cooperation in Government Agencies and Public
Bodies (1233/2013), and the Act on Cooperation between the Employer and Employees in
Municipalities (449/2007).
Section 5
Processing data concerning health

The employer has the right to process data concerning the employee's health status if the
data has been collected from the employee himself or herself, or elsewhere with the
employee’s written consent, and the data needs to be processed in order to pay sick pay
or other comparable health-related benefits or to establish whether there is a justified
reason for absence or if the employee expressly wishes his or her working capacity to be
assessed on the basis of data concerning his or her health. In addition, the employer has
the right to process such data in the specific circumstances, and to the stipulated extent,
separately provided elsewhere in the law.

4(18)

Data concerning the employee's health may only be processed by persons who prepare,
make or implement decisions concerning employment relationships on the basis of such
data. The employer shall nominate such persons or specify the tasks that involve
processing of the data concerning health. Persons who process such data may not
disclose any of it to a third party either during or after their employment relationship.
A doctor’s certificate or statement concerning the employee’s working capacity given to the
employer by the employee may, however, be supplied to the occupational health service
provider for the purpose of carrying out the occupational health care duties laid down in
the Occupational Health Care Act (1383/2001), unless the employee has forbidden this.

The employer must store any data in its possession concerning the employee's health
separately from any other personal data that it has collected. Data concerning health shall
be erased immediately after the grounds for processing referred to in paragraph 1 have
ceased to exist. The grounds and necessity of processing shall be evaluated at least every
five years. (347/2019)
Section 5 a (511/2008)
Processing of personal credit data

The employer has the right to obtain and use personal credit data referred to in section 4
of the Credit Information Act (527/2007) concerning a job applicant selected for a position
for the purpose of assessing the job applicant’s reliability when the intention is that the
applicant will work in duties that require particular reliability and
1) that involve the power to make significant financial commitments on behalf of the
employer or to use de facto independent discretionary power in the preparation of such
commitments;
2) in which the employee’s specific duty is to grant and control financially significant
credits;
3) in the administration of which the employee is given access to specially protected trade
secrets of key significance for the employer or its customer; (610/2018)

5(18)

4) that require access rights to information systems that will allow the transfer of the
employer’s or its customer’s funds, or modify the related information, or in which the
employee is granted system administrator rights to such an information system;
5) that essentially involve the processing, without any immediate supervision, of large
amounts of money, or securities or valuable items;
6) that involve the guarding of the employer’s or its customer’s property;
7) that, as a rule, involve working in a private home without supervision.
The provisions of subsection 1 shall also apply if the employee’s duties change during the
employment relationship in such a way that they fulfil the preconditions laid down in the
stated subsection concerning the employer’s right to handle personal credit data.

The employer is responsible for the costs of obtaining the personal credit data.

Section 19, subsection 2, paragraph 9 of the Credit Information Act contains provisions
regarding the right to use personal credit data when a person is selected into a position of
responsibility in a company.
Chapter 3
Processing data on drug use

Section 6
Drug test certificate

The employer may only process data on the drug use testing of the employee which is
contained in the drug test certificate supplied to the employer by the person concerned.
The processing of the data is otherwise subject to the provisions of section 5(2-4).

A drug test certificate means a certificate issued by a health care professional and
laboratory designated by the employer stating that the employee has been tested for the
use of a drug referred to in section 3, subsection 1, paragraph 5 of the Narcotics Act
(373/2008) and containing a report based on the test stating whether the employee has

6(18)

used drugs for non-medicinal purposes in a manner that has impaired his or her working
capacity or functional capacity. (375/2008)

Drug tests and the certificates of such tests are subject to the provisions of section 19 of
the Occupational Health Care Act.
Section 7
Submission of a drug test certificate during recruitment

The employer may receive or otherwise process data entered in a drug test certificate, with
the consent of the applicant selected for the job, only if the applicant is to do the type of
work that requires precision, reliability, independent judgement or good ability to react and
if performing the work while under the influence of drugs or while addicted to drugs could:
1) endanger the life, health or occupational safety of the employee or other persons;
2) endanger national defence or state security;
3) endanger traffic safety;
4) increase the risk of significant environmental damage;
5) endanger the protection, usability, integrity and quality of information received while
working and thus cause harm or damage to public interests protected by confidentiality
provisions or endanger the protection of privacy or the rights of data subjects; or
6) endanger a trade secret, or cause more than a minor level of financial loss to the
employer or the employer’s customer, provided that endangering a trade secret or
causing a financial risk could not be prevented by other means. (610/2018)
The employer also has the right to process data with the job applicant’s consent, as
referred to in subsection 1, in the event that:
1) the applicant is to carry out tasks in which special trust is required, in which work will be
performed elsewhere than in premises supervised by the employer and in which the
performance of duties while under the influence of drugs or while addicted to drugs may
cause significant financial loss to a customer of the employer or endanger the
customer’s personal safety;

7(18)

2) the applicant is to carry out tasks which, on a permanent basis and to a material degree,
include raising, teaching, caring for or otherwise looking after a minor, or other work
involving personal interaction with a minor, and no other person is involved; or
3) the applicant is to carry out the type of tasks in which there is independent and
uncontrolled access to drugs or a more than minor quantity of medicines that could be
used for the purposes of intoxication.
The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 also apply if the employee’s duties change during
the employment relationship in such a way that they meet the preconditions referred to
above concerning the employer’s right to process data entered in a drug test certificate.

Provisions on the submission of a drug test certificate to the employer as a precondition for
appointment to a civil service post are laid down in section 8b of the State Civil Servants
Act (750/1994) and, in the case of recruitment to a public sector service relationship, in
section 7 of the Act on Civil Servants in Local Government (304/2003). Provisions on the
action programme on substance abuse prevention are laid down in section 11 of the
Occupational Health Care Act.
Section 8
Submission of a drug test certificate during the employment relationship

The employer may require the employee to present a drug test certificate during his or her
employment relationship if the employer has a justified reason to suspect that the
employee is under the influence of drugs at work or that the employee has a drug
addiction and if testing is necessary to establish the employee’s working or functional
capacity and the employee does the type of work that requires special precision, reliability,
independent judgement or good ability to react and in which the performance of duties
while under the influence of drugs or while addicted to drugs:
1) seriously endangers the life, health or occupational safety of the employee or other
persons;
2) seriously endangers national defence or state security;
3) seriously endangers traffic safety;
4) could considerably increase the risk of significant environmental damage;

8(18)

5) seriously endangers the protection, usability, integrity and quality of information
received while working and could thus cause harm or damage to public interests
protected by confidentiality provisions or endanger the protection of privacy or the rights
of data subjects;
6) endangers a financially significant trade secret or could cause a significant financial loss
to the employer or the employer’s customer, provided that endangering the trade secret
or causing a financial risk could not be prevented by other means; or (610/2018)
7) could significantly increase the risk of illegal trading in or spread of substances in the
possession of the employer that are referred to in section 3, subsection 1, paragraph 5
of the Narcotics Act. (375/2008)

The employer may impose on the employee a reasonable time limit within which the
certificate must be presented. Provisions on the action programme on substance abuse
prevention are laid down in section 11 of the Occupational Health Care Act.
The employer also has the right to process data entered in a drug test certificate if, on the
basis of a positive drug test result, the employee has pledged to undergo treatment for
drug abuse and the processing of data in the certificate is related to monitoring
implementation of the treatment.
Section 9
The employer’s duty to provide information about a drug test certificate

The employer shall notify the job applicant in connection with the application procedure
prior to the signing of an employment contract, or the employee prior to a change in the
terms of his or her contract, that the work is such that the employer intends to process the
data entered in a drug test certificate in accordance with section 7, or is such that the
employer intends to require the employee to present a drug test certificate in accordance
with section 8(2).
Section 10
Cost of acquiring a certificate

9(18)

The employer shall meet the cost of acquiring certificates referred to in this Chapter which
are submitted to it.
Section 11
Relation to the provisions on health examinations

The provisions of sections 7 and 8 will not prevent the taking of a drug test as a part of the
job applicant’s or employee’s health examination performed by the occupational health
care unit under the Occupational Health Care Act, the State Civil Servants Act or the Act
on Civil Servants in Local Government. Provisions on information to be entered in the
certificate issued following a health examination under the Occupational Health Care Act
shall be laid down separately.
Section 12
Application of the provisions to professional athletes

The provisions of this Chapter do not apply to athletes in an employment relationship
referred to in Chapter 1, section 1, of the Employment Contracts Act (55/2001).
Chapter 4
Preconditions concerning the undertaking of tests and examinations

Section 13
Personality and aptitude assessments
With the employee’s consent, he or she can be tested by means of personality and
aptitude assessments to establish his or her capacity to perform the work in question or his
or her need for training and other occupational development. The employer shall ensure
that the assessment methods used are reliable, the persons conducting the assessment
are experts, and the findings of the assessment are free from error. When checking that
the findings are free from error, the assessment method used and the nature of the
assessment method must be taken into account.

10(18)

Upon request, the employer or an assessor designated by the employer shall provide the
employee concerned with a written statement on the assessment of the employee’s
personality or aptitude free of charge. If the employer has received the statement orally,
the employee must be informed of its content.
Section 14
Use of health care services

When carrying out employees health examinations and tests and taking samples, health
care professionals, properly trained laboratory personnel and health care services must be
used as provided in the health care legislation.

The provisions of subsection 1 also apply to alcohol and drug tests.
Section 15
Genetic testing

The employer is not permitted to require the employee to take part in genetic testing during
recruitment or during the employment relationship, and has no right to know whether or not
the employee has ever taken part in such testing.
Chapter 5
Camera surveillance in the workplace
Section 16
Preconditions for camera surveillance

The employer may operate a system of continuous surveillance within its premises based
on the use of technical equipment which transmits or records images (camera
surveillance) for the purpose of ensuring the personal security of employees and other
persons on the premises, protecting property or supervising the proper operation of
production processes, and for preventing or investigating situations that endanger safety,
property or the production process. Camera surveillance may not, however, be used for

11(18)

the surveillance of a particular employee or particular employees in the workplace. Neither
may camera surveillance be used in lavatories, changing rooms or other similar places, in
other staff facilities or in work rooms designated for the personal use of employees.

Notwithstanding subsection 1, the employer may, however, direct the camera surveillance
at a particular work station where employees are at work if the surveillance is essential for:
1) preventing an apparent threat of violence related to the work of the employee or an
apparent harm or danger to the employee’s safety or health;
2) preventing or investigating property crimes if an essential part of the employee’s work is
to handle property of high value or quality, such as money, securities or valuables; or
3) safeguarding the employee’s interests and rights, where the camera surveillance is
based on the request of the employee who is to be the subject of the surveillance.
(347/2019)
Section 17
Transparency when implementing camera surveillance

When planning and implementing camera surveillance, the employer shall ensure that:
1) the opportunity of using other means that interfere less with the privacy of employees is
explored before the introduction of camera surveillance;
2) the privacy of employees is not interfered with more than is necessary for achieving the
aim of the measures;
3) paragraph was repealed by Act 347/2019
4) recordings are used only for the purpose for which the surveillance was carried out;
5) after the cooperative and consultative procedures referred to in section 21, employees
are informed of when the camera surveillance will begin, how it will be implemented,
how and in what situations any recordings would be used and, in situations referred to
in section 16 subsection 2, the locations of the cameras; and
6) prominent notification of the camera surveillance and its method of implementation is
displayed in the areas in which the cameras are located.
Notwithstanding subsection 1, paragraph 4 and section 21, the employer has the right to
use recordings for:

12(18)

1) substantiating the grounds for termination of an employment relationship;
2) investigating and substantiating harassment or molestation as referred to in the Act on
Equality Between Women and Men (609/1986), harassment referred to in section 14 of
the Non-Discrimination Act (1325/2014) or harassment and inappropriate behaviour as
referred to in the Occupational Safety and Health Act (738/2002), provided that the
employer has a justified reason to suspect that the employee is guilty of harassment,
molestation or inappropriate behaviour; or (1345/2014)
3) investigating an occupational accident or some other situation causing a danger or
threat referred to in the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Recordings shall be destroyed as soon as they are no longer necessary for achieving the
purpose of the camera surveillance, and no later than one year after the end of the
recording. A recording may, however, be stored after this period if it is needed for
completing the processing of a matter referred to in subsection 2 that emerged for
investigation before the end of the maximum storage period or if the employer needs the
recording to substantiate the appropriateness of terminating an employment relationship,
or if there is some other special reason for keeping the recording.
Chapter 6
Retrieval and opening of electronic mail messages belonging to the employer

Section 18
The employer’s obligations regarding necessary arrangements

The employer has the right to retrieve and open electronic mail messages sent to an
electronic mail address allocated by the employer for the use of the employee or electronic
mail messages sent by the employee from such an address only if the employer has
planned and arranged for the employee the necessary measures to protect electronic mail
messages sent in the employee’s name or by the employee and, to this end, has
specifically ensured that:
1) the employee can, with the aid of the electronic mail system’s automatic reply function,
send notification to a message sender about his or her absence and the length of

13(18)

absence, and information about the person who is to take care of the tasks of the
absent employee; or
2) the employee can direct messages to another person approved by the employer for this
task or to another employer-approved address of the employee; or
3) the employee can give his or her consent to an arrangement whereby in his or her
absence another person of his or her choosing and approved by the employer for the
task can receive messages sent to the employee, with the aim of establishing whether
the employee has been sent a message that is clearly intended for the employer for the
purpose of managing the work and on which it is essential for the employer to have
information on account of its operations or the appropriate organisation of the work.

The provisions of sections 19 and 20 constitute further preconditions for the retrieval or
opening of the electronic mail messages referred to in subsection 1 above.
Section 19
Retrieval of electronic messages belonging to the employer

The employer has the right, assisted by the person vested with the authority of information
system administrator, to find out on the basis of information concerning the message
sender, recipient or title, whether the employee has, in his or her absence, been sent, or
has sent or received immediately before the absence, messages belonging to the
employer that, in order to complete negotiations concerning its operations or to serve
customers or safeguard its operations, it is otherwise essential for the employer to gain
information on, if:
1) the employee manages tasks independently on behalf of the employer and the
employer does not operate a system with which the matters attended to by the
employee and the processing stages involved are recorded or are otherwise
ascertained;
2) it is evident, on account of the employee’s tasks and matters pending, that messages
belonging to the employer have been sent or received;
3) the employee is temporarily prevented from performing his or her duties, and messages
belonging to the employer cannot be obtained for the employer’s use despite the fact
that the employer has seen to the obligations referred to in section 18; and

14(18)

4) the employee’s consent cannot be obtained within a reasonable time and the
investigation of the matter cannot be delayed.

If the employee has died or if he or she is prevented in a permanent way from performing
his or her duties and his or her consent cannot be obtained, the employer has the right,
under the conditions laid down in subsection 1(1-2) and on the basis of information on the
message sender, recipient or title, to find out if there are messages belonging to it, unless
finding out about the matters attended to by the employee and safeguarding of the
employer’s operations is possible by other means.

If message retrieval does not lead to opening of the message, a report signed by the
persons involved stating why the message was retrieved, the time it was retrieved and
who performed the retrieval must be drawn up. The report shall be submitted to the
employee without undue delay, unless otherwise provided by subsection 2. The
information on the message sender, recipient or title may not be processed more
extensively than necessary for the purpose of retrieving the message, and the persons
processing the information may not disclose it to a third party during the employment
relationship or after it has ended .
Section 20
Opening of electronic messages belonging to the employer

If, on the basis of the information on the sender or recipient of an electronic message or
the message title, it is apparent that a message sent to the employee or by the employee
is clearly one that belongs to the employer and about whose content it is essential that the
employer obtains information in order to complete negotiations concerning its operations
or to serve customers or safeguard its operations, and the message sender and recipient
cannot be contacted for the purpose of establishing the content of the message or for the
purpose of sending it to an address indicated by the employer, the employer may, in cases
referred to in section 19, open the message with the assistance of the person vested with
the authority of information system administrator and in the presence of another person.

15(18)

A report about the opening shall be drawn up, signed by the persons involved, stating
which message was opened, why it was opened, the time of opening, the persons
performing the opening and to whom the information on the content of the opened
message was given. The report shall be submitted to the employee without undue delay,
unless otherwise provided by section 19 subsection 2. The opened message shall be
stored, and its content and the information on the sender may not be processed more
extensively than is necessary for the purpose of opening the message, nor may the
persons processing the information disclose the content of the message to a third party
during the employment relationship or after it has ended.

The person employed by the employer or a person acting on the instruction of the former,
to whom the employee has directed his or her electronic mail in the manner referred to in
section 18 subsection 1 paragraph 2 or who can, in the manner referred to in section 18
subsection 1 paragraph 3, and with the employee’s consent, receive messages sent in the
employee’s name, has the right to open a message, complying with the provisions of
subsection 2, unless the employee has given his or her consent to another procedure.
