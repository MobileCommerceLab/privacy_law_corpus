EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Executive Summary
INTRODUCTION
In September 2013 the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) notified the Electronic Health Record
(EHR) Standards for India. The set of standards given therein were chosen from the best available and used
standards applicable to Electronic Health Records from around the world keeping in view their suitability to
and applicability in India. The Committee constituted to recommend the standards drew from experts,
practitioners, government officials, technologists, and industry. The notified standards were not only
supported by professional bodies, regulatory bodies, stakeholders, but various technical and social
commentators as well, as being a step in the right direction. MoH&FW moved ahead with facilitating the
adoption, as next steps, and in last two years the Ministry has made available standards like SNOMED CT
free-for-use in the country as well as appoint interim National Release Center (NRC) to handle this clinical
terminology standard that is fast gaining widespread acceptance amongst the various healthcare IT
stakeholder communities worldwide.
At the time of notifying the standards in September 2013, it was understood that the standards themselves
will continue to evolve over time. Consequently, it was accepted that this notification will require revision
from time to time. This becomes all the more necessary as understanding of those standards, their
implementation and the expectations from the healthcare systems improve. Hence, MoH&FW constituted an
expert group to review the earlier notified set of standards based on the experience and with eyes firmly on
the future. The set of standards provided herein represents the recommendations of the Expert Committee
arrived at after deliberating on the various aspects of standardizations in healthcare record systems. The
Committee also carefully examined the provisions of open standards and the guidelines as per the norms
suggested by MeitY, Government of India and recommended the standards given later in the document.

NEED FOR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD
For a health record of an individual to be clinically meaningful it needs to be from conception or birth, at the
very least. As one progresses through one’s life, every record of every clinical encounter represents a healthrelated event in one’s life. Each of these records may be insignificant or significant depending on the current
problems that the person is suffering from. Thus, it becomes imperative that these records be available,
longitudinally arranged as a time series, and be clinically relevant to provide a summary of the various
healthcare events in the life of a person.
An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a collection of various medical records that get generated during any
clinical encounter or events. With rise of self-care and homecare devices and systems, nowadays meaningful
healthcare data get generated 24x7 and also have long-term clinical relevance. The purpose of collecting
medical records, as much as possible, are manifold – better and evidence based care, increasingly accurate
and faster diagnosis that translates into better treatment at lower costs of care, avoid repeating unnecessary
investigations, robust analytics including predictive analytics to support personalized care, improved health

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
policy decisions based on better understanding of the underlying issues, etc., all translating into improved
personal and public health.
Without standards, a lifelong medical record is simply not possible, as different records from different
sources spread across ~80+ years, potentially, needs to be brought meaningfully together. To achieve this, a
set of pre-defined standards for information capture, storage, retrieval, exchange, and analytics that includes
images, clinical codes and data is imperative.

STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS
This document provides a structured overview of the key EHR standards with respect to Indian healthcare
system. For every aspect of data/information that is part of any healthcare record system has been addressed
with a short guideline regarding implementation specific to the item-in-context included. Various nonrelated recommendations from previous edition have been removed to better streamline the set of standards
selected and achieve harmony among them. A detailed recommendation on the interoperability and
standards, clinical informatics standards, data ownership, privacy and security aspects, and the various
coding systems are also provided. The set of standards given in earlier edition has been updated with their
latest versions as the country moves towards a better implementation. It would not be out of place to note
that certain sections of the document have been removed to provide increased readability and consistency
throughout while avoiding duplication, ambiguity and contradictions.

SCOPE
This document provides a set of recommendations relevant to adoption of electronic health informatics
standards in EHR/EMR and other similar clinical information systems. The scope is limited to identifying the
standards, their intended purposes in such systems, followed by a short guideline-for-implementation
approach. It is understood that with adoption of these standards properly, the data capture, storage, view,
presentation, and transmission will be standardized to levels that will achieve interoperability of both
meaning and data contained in the records. This document does not cater to wider implementation scenarios
such as of administrative, legal or regulatory nature. This document also does not cater to aspects of creation
and operation of local, regional or national infrastructures, indexes, or repositories as they are dealt with by
appropriate regulative/administrative bodies.

LOOKING AHEAD
This document is a continuation of its earlier version, but in many ways reflects the growing confidence in
the path correctly chosen earlier – providing a set of international and proven standards with focus towards
achieving syntactic and semantic interoperability of health records. The idea that any person in India can go
to any health service provider/practitioner, any diagnostic center or any pharmacy and yet be able to access
and have fully integrated and always available health records in an electronic format is not only empowering
but also the vision for efficient 21st century healthcare delivery.

Page 2

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In conclusion, it must be reiterated that these standards cannot be considered either in isolation or as “etched
in stone for all eternity”. These will need to undergo periodic review and update as necessary. Hence, it is
imperative that this document be a “living document”.

STANDARDS AND INTEROPERABILITY
Standards and Interoperability
INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS
The primary aim of interoperability standards is to ensure syntactic (structural) and semantic (inherent
meaning) interoperability of data amongst systems at all times. The need for that cannot be overstated, more
so within healthcare information systems whose primary aim is to deliver life-long clinical care at all times
so that the person being cared for is able to maintain his/her health at optimal levels.
The set of standards outlined in this document represents an incremental approach to adopting standards,
implementation specifications; criteria to enhance the interoperability, functionality, utility, and security of
health information technology; and to support its widespread adoption. It is to be kept in mind that these
standards need to be flexible and modifiable to adapt to the demographic and resource variance observed in
a country like India with its large population and diverse culture that is spread across a large region of varied
geographical landscapes – hilly regions, river basins, desert, coast, etc. – many of which are remote and
accessible only with difficulty.
It is important to recognize that interoperability and standardization can occur at many different levels. To
achieve interoperability, information models would need to be harmonized into a consistent representation.
In other cases, organizations may use the same information model, but use different vocabularies or code
sets (for example, SNOMED CT or ICD10) within those information models. To achieve interoperability at
this level, standardizing vocabularies, or mapping between different vocabularies may be necessary. For
some levels, (such as the network transport protocol), an industry standard that is widely used (e.g. TCP/IP
– Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) will likely be the most appropriate. Ultimately, to
achieve true interoperability, it is anticipated that multiple layers – network transportation protocols, data
and services descriptions, information models, and vocabularies and code sets – will need to be standardized
and/or harmonized to produce an inclusive, consistent representation of the interoperability requirements.
It is further anticipated that using a harmonization process will integrate different representations of health
care information into a consistent representation and maintain and update that consistent representation
over time. For an information model, this process could include merging related concepts, adding new
concepts, and mapping concepts from one representation of health care information to another. The need to
support standardization of data and services descriptions and vocabularies and codes sets is appropriately
addressed.
It is also recognized that a sustainable and incremental approach to the adoption of standards will require
processes for harmonizing both current and future standards. This will allow the incremental updating of
the initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria and provide a framework
to maintain them. The decision to adopt such updates will be informed and guided by recommendations
from an appropriate authority such as the proposed National eHealth Authority (NeHA), Ministry of Health
& Family Welfare or expert groups.

Page 8

STANDARDS AND INTEROPERABILITY
GOALS
The goals of standards in electronic health record systems are:
•

Promote interoperability and where necessary be specific about certain content exchange and
vocabulary standards to establish a path forward toward semantic interoperability

•

Support the evolution and timely maintenance of adopted standards

•

Promote technical innovation using adopted standards

•

Encourage participation and adoption by all vendors and stakeholders

•

Keep implementation costs as low as reasonably possible

•

Consider best practices, experiences, policies and frameworks

•

To the extent possible, adopt standards that are modular and not interdependent.

HEALTH RECORD IT STANDARDS
Health Record IT Standards
IDENTIFICATION AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OF PATIENT
Demographic information including a unique identifier is necessary in a health record system in order to
capture identifying information as well as identifiers for linking other medical artifacts logically as well as
physically. All health record systems must therefore adhere to the following standards for capturing
information related to patient demography and identifiers:
1.

ISO/TS 22220:2011 Health Informatics – Identification of Subjects of Health Care

2.

MDDS – Demographic (Person Identification and Land Region Codification) version 1.1 from EGovernance Standards, Government of India

Implementation Guideline: Implementers must insure that health record application is able to capture all data
fields as provided in the above two standards for completeness. It should also ensure that the system is able
to interoperate (receive/import/send/export) all demographics information as provided in above two
standards as per demand, i.e. when requested for demographics data in MDDS compliant format it should
generate artefacts (file, message, etc.) as per that standard. Where codes related to location, authority, type
of organization etc. are required, they should be taken from the MDDS-Demographic Standard.
A health record system must have provision to include patient identifiers of following types:
1.

UIDAI Aadhaar Number (preferred where available)

2.

Both of the following in case Aadhaar is not available:
2.1 Local Identifier (as per scheme used by HSP)
2.2 Any Central or State Government issued Photo Identity Card Number

Implementation Guidelines:
1.

Implementers must ensure that the Aadhaar number, where that is available, be used as the preferred
identifier to serve as the unique health identifier. In case the Aadhaar number is not available, the system
should allow a user to insert more than one (minimum of two) identifiers for each patient along with its
scope and provider (as given in above mentioned patient demography standards) in the system. In
situations where identity of patient cannot be obtained or ascertained, temporary identifiers may be
used (as per scheme used by HSP) and later confirmed identifiers may be inserted (while making earlier
ones as inactive).

2.

Identification of Patient across EHR systems: Due to lack of mandate for use of Aadhaar or any such
alternative(s) national unique identifier, it is difficult to match patient records when exchanging them
between two EHR systems. This may lead to situations where different combinations of local identifier
and photo identity card numbers of the same person are used at different locations and/or in solutions.

Page 10

HEALTH RECORD IT STANDARDS
Thus, a single person may get to have different identities under which his/her records are captured. A
conflict resolution process may be required to help resolve such cases. At this time, there is no direct
solution available other than to use smart (possibly heuristic) algorithms to attempt to match records
without or with intervention/confirmation of a human supervisor. Such an algorithm may use name
(phonetic or spelling), address (full or parts), date of birth / age, gender, or other such matching details
to mark incoming or searched records as possible or exact match before amalgamation or subsequent
use. ISV may additionally need to provide the ability to merge/demerge patients to support this process
within their solutions.

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS AND FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS
A health record system must meet architectural requirements and functional specifications to remain faithful
to the needs of service delivery, be clinically valid and reliable, meet legal and ethical requirements, and
support good medical practices. Therefore, a health record system must conform to the following standards:
1.

ISO 18308:2011 Health Informatics – Requirements for an Electronic Health Record Architecture

2.

ISO/HL7 10781:2015 Health Informatics - HL7 Electronic Health Records-System Functional Model
Release 2 (EHR FM)

Implementation Guideline: Above two standards, despite being extensive, do not represent the full set of
specifications and requirements that need to be met by a health record system or its many variants (PHR,
etc.) or all possible use cases. The above mentioned standards are to be used as minimum set to be used
within the scope of implementation as per relevance to the system being developed / deployed.

LOGICAL INFORMATION REFERENCE MODEL AND STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION
A health record system must accumulate observable data and information for all clinically relevant events
and encounters. For this purpose, it is important to have common semantic and syntactic logical information
model and structural composition for captured artefacts. Unless the data being captured is standardized, its
communication and understanding may not be same across systems. Therefore, a health record system must
conform to the following standards:
1.

ISO 13940 Health Informatics - System of Concepts to Support Continuity of Care

2.

ISO 13606 Health Informatics - Electronic Health Record Communication (Part 1 through 3)

3.

openEHR Foundation Models Release 1.0.2
3.1 Required Model Specifications: Base Model, Reference Model, Archetype Model
3.2 Optional Model Specifications: Service Model, Querying, Clinical Decision Support

Implementation Guideline: The ISO 13940 (also known as CEN ContSys) is to be generally used for purpose
of modelling and describing concept system and organize information objects. While ISO 13606 set of
standards are basic reference model and related specifications, openEHR provides ISO 18308 conformant

Page 11

HEALTH RECORD IT STANDARDS
platform-independent implementation harmonized with ISO 13606 standard. Implementers are free to
design internal structures, databases, and user interfaces as per their requirements and preferred
technology platforms but structural composition for clinical data/information artefact must be logically
similar to Reference Model given in above standards. openEHR Operational Templates (OPT) adopted by an
implementation, are to be public and free in required format for other implementers to ensure
interoperability among them.

MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY AND CODING STANDARDS
In order to have semantic interoperability between different health record systems, it is necessary to follow
a common terminology and coding system standards to express unambiguous meaning of data captured,
stored, transmitted, and analyzed. It is also important to have these terminologies and codes in computer
process-able format to aid automation and ensure that data is in an analyzable state at all times. Therefore,
a health record system must conform to the following standards:
1.

Primary Terminology: IHTSDO - SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT)

Implementation Guideline: A health record system must use SNOMED CT as the primary internal encoding
system for all clinically relevant, including dental, nursing, substance/drugs related information. IHTSDO
SNOMED CT code shall also be used while communicating clinical information to other health record systems.
SNOMED CT concept codes (as pre-coordinated or as post-coordinated expressions) are to be used for all
hierarchies covered under the standard unless otherwise provided in this document. It shall also be the
coding system that must be used internally in other information storage and communication standards such
as openEHR archetypes, HL7, DICOM, etc. IHTSDO releases SNOMED CT twice annually.
2.

Test, Measurement and Observation Codes: Regenstrief Institute - Logical Observation Identifiers
Names and Codes (LOINC)

Implementation Guideline: LOINC coding is to be used for processing results and reports with Laboratory and
Imaging Information Systems. N.B.: SNOMED CT to LOINC coding interchange map is available from IHTSDO
and Regenstrief Institute.
3.

Classification Codes: WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC)
3.1 WHO ICD-10: International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and its derivative classifications
3.2 WHO ICF: International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
3.3 International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI)
3.4 International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O)

Implementation Guideline: WHO FIC codes are primarily used for aggregated information and
statistical/epidemiological analysis for public health purposes derived from health records that contain
patient care related information as well as information that is crucial for management, health financing and

Page 12

HEALTH RECORD IT STANDARDS
general health system administration. While SNOMED CT is to be used by health record systems for
terminology, generated classification-based reports may require the use of WHO FIC codes. Classification
based reporting, for statistical or regulatory purposes, may continue to use WHO FIC codes as mandated by
the health regulatory, intelligence, and various research bodies. N.B.: SNOMED CT to ICD-10 coding
interchange map is available from IHTSDO and WHO.

DATA STANDARDS FOR IMAGE, MULTIMEDIA, WAVEFORM, DOCUMENT
A health record system stores data records and files of various types in support of clinical functions. These
data elements serve the purpose of documentary records of various diagnostic and prescriptive data or
information generated. Therefore, a health record system must conform to the following standards for such
data:
1.

NEMA Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) PS3.0-2015

Implementation Guideline: NEMA DICOM PS3.0-2015 is a comprehensive standard for handling and
managing image (series or single), waveforms (such as those in ECG/EEG), audio (such as those in digitalstethoscope) and video (such as those in endoscope, ultrasound, etc.) data in medicine. A health record
implementation is required to implement relevant DICOM Information Object Definitions (IODs) for
supported data types in Part-10 compliant files. Where required and relevant, other features of standard
such as services, display, print, and workflow may be implemented.
2.

Scanned or Captured Records:
2.1 Image: JPEG lossy (or lossless) with size and resolution not less than 1024px x 768px at 300dpi
2.2 Audio/Video: ISO/IEC 14496 - Coding of Audio-Visual Objects
2.3 Scanned Documents: ISO 19005-2 Document Management - Electronic Document File Format for
Long-Term Preservation - Part 2: Use of ISO 32000-1 (PDF/A-2) (ref: Best Practices and
Guidelines for Production of Preservable e-Records Ver1.0 from MeitY, Govt. of India)

Implementation Guideline: The above mentioned standards are to be used for documentary data (scan for
prescription, summaries, etc.) and data captured through traditionally non-DICOM compliant sources like
picto-micrographs, pathological photographs, photographs of intramural and extramural lesions, etc. All data
formats that can be converted into relevant DICOM format should be, as relevant, converted and
communicated as secondary captured DICOM format. It may be noted that while no maximum image
resolution has been prescribed, a sufficiently acceptable limit may be used to avoid unnecessarily large file
that do not aid in correspondingly better interpretation or analysis.

DATA EXCHANGE STANDARDS
A health record system has to operate in a larger ecosystem of other components with which it must share
or communicate data in order to capture and provide as comprehensible medical information as is practical.
A health record system must therefore conform to the following standards:

Page 13

HEALTH RECORD IT STANDARDS
1.

Event/Message Exchange: ANSI/HL7 V2.8.2-2015 HL7 Standard Version 2.8.2 - An Application
Protocol for Electronic Data Exchange in Healthcare Environments

2.

Summary Records Exchange: ASTM/HL7 CCD Release 1 (basis standard ISO/HL7 27932:2009)

3.

EHR Archetypes: ISO 13606-5:2010 Health informatics - Electronic Health Record Communication Part 5: Interface Specification [Also, refer to openEHR Service Model specification]

4.

Imaging/Waveform Exchange: NEMA DICOM PS3.0-2015 (using DIMSE services& Part-10 media/files)

Implementation Guideline: Implementation of exchange standards is expected to be at least for the scope of
data captured or retained by the health record system. To explain further, full implementation of ANSI/HL7
V2.8.2 for each event and message is not required in health record systems but minimum implementation
supporting the types of events and messages relevant to the system is required. Similarly,
implementation/support of DICOM DIMSE C-Store and/or C-FIND/C-GET service is expected for IODs
supported by health record system whereas implementation of WADO could be optional.

OTHER STANDARDS RELEVANT TO HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS
Healthcare record systems need to co-exist within a larger ecosystem with various other systems. It is
important for all systems within a healthcare setup to adhere to relevant standards. While standards related
to such systems are not within the scope of this document, as a general rule, standards created or ratified by
following Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) should be used:
1.

Bureau of Indian Standards and its MHD-17 Committee

2.

ISO TC 215 set of standards

3.

IEEE/NEMA/CE standards for physical systems and interfaces

Implementation Guideline: To help the implementers, an indicative list of such standards is provided in the
“Standards at a Glance” section above. Wherever applicable, BIS-approved standards shall be preferred for
implementation.

DISCHARGE/TREATMENT SUMMARY FORMAT
Implementers must ensure that the logical information model includes data elements to satisfy requirements
of the format for Medical Records as specified by Appendix-3 of Medical Council of India (MCI) Code of Ethics
Regulation 2002 (amended up to Feb-2016). The printed reports should meet MCI prescribed formats
whenever any discharge or treatment summary is prepared.

E-PRESCRIPTION
Pharmacy Council of India (PCI) has, in its recent regulation (Pharmacy Practice Regulations, 2015
Notification No. 14-148/ 2012- PCI), provided the definition of the term under Section 2(j) that the term
‘Prescription’ includes the term ‘electronic direction’. Implementers must therefore ensure that the logical

Page 14

HEALTH RECORD IT STANDARDS
information model includes data elements to satisfy requirements of the format for Medical Prescription as
specified by the Pharmacy Council of India. The printed prescription will need to be in the PCI prescribed
format whenever any medical prescription meant for drug dispensing is prepared. For the purpose of ePrescription, implementers must ensure that the electronic version is digitally signed by a registered medical
practitioner, and its non-repudiation is ensured at all times. The pharmacists shall be able to print a copy of
e-Prescription in the required format along with other relevant digital authentication details.

PERSONAL HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL DEVICES INTERFACING
Where not covered under relevant data exchange standards, it is recommended that IEEE 11073 health
informatics standards and related ISO standards for medical devices be followed as appropriate whenever
any personal healthcare/medical device is interfaced with the EMR system for the purpose of clinical data
exchange, retrieval, storage, etc.

The data once entered into a health record system must become immutable. The healthcare provider may
have the option to re-insert/append any record in relation to the medical care of the patient as necessary
with a complete audit trail of such change maintained by the system. Alteration of the previously saved data
is not permitted. No update or update like command shall be accessible to user or administrator to store a
medical record or part thereof. Any record requiring revision should create a new medical record containing
the changed/appended/modified data of earlier record. This record shall then be stored and marked as
ACTIVE while rendering the previous version(s) of the same record being marked INACTIVE. The data will
thus in essence become immutable. A strict audit trail shall be maintained of all activities at all times that
may be reviewed by an appropriate authority like auditor, legal representatives of the patient, the patient,
healthcare provider, privacy officer, court appointed/authorized person, etc. as deemed necessary.
As-Is Principal:
The data captured through the devices is usually in a certain format whereas the data provided by the doctor
as file may be in some different format. These data provided / included in the system are to be treated as
sacrosanct. The “As-Is Principal” requires that the data captured in the first instance should be retrievable at
any given point of time later in the same format, clarity, size and detail as it was provided during the time of
record creation.
It effectively means that the system is not allowed to make any changes either to the data or its format or its
nature at any point other than the creation time for any reason. However, if it is required that the data needs
to be altered either to carry some additional information at some later point, like annotation on images, or
correction of errors of omission or commission, etc., it must be done on a copy of the original data, keeping
the original data intact, and marking the updated version as active while marking the previous version
inactive. The modified data will then become part of the EHR/EMR.

Page 15

HEALTH RECORD IT STANDARDS
Informed Format Change:
Whenever, the data, its format or its nature needs to be changed within the system, it must be done with the
explicit consent of the doctor / technician / person that is entering or managing the data. This explicit
consent can also be taken from a set of preferences already set by the user or the administrator / root of the
system. In such preference based consent, there is no need to prompt the user for permission at each
insertion point.
Also, in case the system is set to change format or nature of data automatically by setting of preferences, it
must be made sure that the rule of conversion is declared in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of
site/application.

Page 21

DATA OWNERSHIP OF HEALTH RECORDS
•

Information obtained from an anonymous source under a promise of confidentiality.

•

Psychotherapy notes.

•

Information compiled for civil, criminal or administrative action.

ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS PRESERVATION
Preservation of medical records assume significant importance in view of the fact that an electronic health
record of a person is an aggregation of all electronic medical records of the person from the very first entry
to the most recent one. Hence, all records must compulsorily be preserved and not destroyed during the lifetime of the person, ever.
Upon the demise of the patient where there are no court cases pending, the records can be removed from
active status and turned to inactive status. HSPs are free to decide when to make a record inactive, however,
it is preferable to follow the “three (3) year rule” where all records of a deceased are made inactive three (3)
years after death.
It is however preferred, and the HSPs are strongly encouraged to ensure, that the records are never be
destroyed or removed permanently. The health of the blood relatives and natural descendants of the person
can be strongly influenced by the health of the person and on-demand access to these may prove to be hugely
useful in the maintenance of the health of the relations.
Furthermore, analysis of health data of all persons is expected to greatly benefit in the understanding of
health, disease processes and the amelioration thereof.
With rapid decline in costs of data archiving coupled with the ability to store increasing amounts of data that
may be readily accessible, continued maintenance of such data is not expected to lead to any major impact
on the overall system maintenance and use.

PATIENT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
Data are "individually identifiable" if they include any of the under mentioned identifiers for an individual or
for the individual's employer or family member, or if the provider or researcher is aware that the information
could be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to identify an individual. These
identifiers are as follows:
•

Name

•

Address (all geographic subdivisions smaller than street address, and PIN code)

•

All elements (except years) of dates related to an individual (including date of birth, date of death, etc.)

•

Telephone, cell (mobile) phone and/or Fax numbers

•

Email address

•

Bank Account and/or Credit Card Number

•

Medical record number

•

Health plan beneficiary number

DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Data Privacy and Security
SECURITY OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH INFORMATION:
The Privacy Standards and the Security Standards are necessarily linked. Any health record system requires
safeguards to ensure that the data is available when needed and that the information is not used, disclosed,
accessed, altered, or deleted inappropriately while being stored or retrieved or transmitted. The Security
Standards work together with the Privacy Standards to establish appropriate controls and protections.
Health sector entities that are required to comply with the Privacy Standards must also comply with the
Security Standards.
Organizations must consider several factors when adopting security measures. How a healthcare provider
satisfies the security requirements and which technology it decides to use are business decisions left to the
individual organizations. In deciding what security measures to adopt, an organization must consider its size,
complexity, and capabilities; it’s technical infrastructure, hardware, and software security capabilities; the
cost of particular security measures; and the probability and degree of the potential risks to the ePHI it stores,
retrieves and transmits.

PURPOSE OF THE SECURITY STANDARDS
The security standards require healthcare providers to implement reasonable and appropriate
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to:
•

ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all the e-PHI they create, transmit, receive, or
maintain

•

protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of their e-PHI

•

protect against uses or disclosures of the e-PHI that are not required or permitted under the Privacy
Standards

•

ensure their workforce will comply with their security policies and procedures

SECURUTY TECHNICAL STANDARDS
To protect the ePHI handles by a healthcare provider, the provider must implement technical safeguards as
part of its security plan. Technical safeguards refer to using technology to protect ePHI by controlling access
to it. Therefore, they must address the following standards, focusing on the functionalities thereof. It is worth
noting that they will need to use an EHR/EMR solution that is able to successfully and robustly demonstrate
the possession and working of these functionalities.
The basic requirements for security and privacy are provided in following standard:
1.

ISO/TS 14441:2013 Health Informatics – Security & Privacy Requirements of EHR Systems for Use in
Conformity Assessment

DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Authentication:
•

Locally within the system the fact that a person or entity seeking access to electronic health
information is indeed the one as claimed and is also authorized to access such information must be
verifiable.

•

Across the network, however extensive it might be, the fact that a person or entity seeking access to
electronic health information across a network is the one claimed and is authorized to access such
information in accordance with the standard specified in this document must be verifiable.

Automatic log-off: An electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity must be forcibly
terminated. To log in back, the user will have to initiate a new log in session. However, for the sake of
ergonomics, it is recommended that the unsaved state of the system at the time of automatic log-off be saved
and presented back to the user for further action. This should be a user-specific feature.
The advisory standard for overall information security management in health is:
2.

ISO 27799 Health informatics - Information Security Management in Health using ISO/IEC 27002

Implementation Guideline: The ISO 27799 is provided as a basic advisory standard for security management.
Other security management and standard / practices / guidelines given by Law (such as IT Act 2000 and
amendments) or regulatory / statutory / certification bodies (such as National Accreditation Board for
Hospitals & Health care Providers (NABH)) should be taken in consideration when designing and/or
implementing health record system.
Access control: The solution must assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user
identity and establish controls that permit only authorized users to access electronic health information. In
cases of emergency where access controls need to be suspended in order to save a life, authorized users (who
are authorized for emergency situations) will be permitted to have unfettered access electronic health
information for the duration of the emergency with the access remaining in force during the validity of the
emergency situation.
Access Privileges: Ideally only clinical care providers should have access rights to a person’s clinical records.
However, different institutional care providers have widely varying access privileges specified that are
institution-specific. No country-wide standards can be specified for this at least at this point in time.
For privilege management and access control, following standards may be used:
3.

ISO 22600:2014 Health informatics - Privilege Management and Access Control (Part 1 through 3)

Implementation Guideline: The ISO 22600 set of standards is provided as an advisory standard for policy
based access control. For the purpose of privilege management, rule / policy based access is expected to give
better control and flexibility in defining and enforcing access control. Access control mechanisms such as
Role Based, Policy Based, or singular user (applicable in case of mobile based PHR) are acceptable as long as

Page 25

DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY
conformant to applicable data security law(s) and rules as well as policy of the organization where
implemented.
Audit log:
•

All actions related to electronic health information in accordance with the standard specified in this
document including viewing should be recorded.

•

All actions based on user-defined events must be recorded.

•

All or a specified set of recorded audit information, upon request or at a set period of time, must be
electronically displayed or printed for user/administrative review.

•

All actions related to electronic health information must be recorded with the date, time, record
identification, and user identification whenever any electronic health information is created, modified
(non-clinical data only), deleted (stale and non-clinical data only), or printed; and an indication of
which action(s) took place must also be recorded.

•

A cross-enterprise secure transaction that contains sufficient identity information such that the
receiver can make access control decisions and produce detailed and accurate security audit trails
should be preferably used within the system.

The advisory standard for audit trail / log in health record system is:
4.

ISO 27789:2013 Health informatics - Audit Trails for Electronic Health Records

Integrity:
•

During data transit the fact that the electronic health information has not been altered in transit in
accordance with the standard specified in this document must be verifiable.

•

Detection of events – all alterations and deletions of electronic health information and audit logs, in
accordance with the standard specified in this document must be detected.

•

Appropriate verification that electronic health information has not been altered in transit shall be
possible at any point in time. A secure hashing algorithm must be used to verify that electronic health
information has not been altered in transit and it is recommended that the Secure Hash Algorithm
(SHA) used must be SHA-256 or higher.

Encryption:
•

Page 26

Generally, all electronic health information must be encrypted and decrypted as necessary according to
organization defined preferences in accordance with the best available encryption key strength
(minimum 256-bits key).

DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY
•

During data exchange all electronic health information must be suitably encrypted and decrypted
when exchanged in accordance with an encrypted and integrity protected link.

•

Secure Transmission standards and mechanisms must be used to allow access to health information as
well as transmit data from one application / site to another. For this purpose HTTPS, SSL v3.0, and TLS
v1.2 standards should be used. Please refer to relevant IETF, IEEE, ISO, and FIPS standards for same.

Digital Certificates:
Use of Digital Certificates for identification and digital signing is recommended in health record system.
Health record system must use following standard where digital certificates are used:
5.

ISO 17090 Health informatics - Public Key Infrastructure (Part 1 through 5)

ADMINISTRATIVE SAFEGUARDS STANDARDS
The Administrative Safeguards require healthcare providers to develop and implement a security
management process that includes policies and procedures that address the full range of their security
vulnerabilities. Being administrative in nature, these need to be internally designed and developed as
standard operating procedure (SOP) that must be published for all users to see and adhere to. Conformance
to adherence may be delegated to the Privacy Officer detailed in the Data Ownership chapter above. To
comply with the Administrative Safeguards, a healthcare provider must implement the following standards.
•

The security management process standard, to prevent security violations;

•

Assigned security responsibility, to identify a security officer;

•

Workforce security, to determine e-PHI user access privileges;

•

Information access management, to authorize access to e-PHI;

•

Security awareness training, to train staff members in security awareness;

•

Security incident procedures, to handle security incidents;

•

Contingency plan, to protect e-PHI during an unexpected event; and

•

Evaluation, to evaluate an organization's security safeguards.

PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS STANDARDS
Physical safeguards are security measures to protect a healthcare provider’s electronic information systems,
related equipment, and the buildings housing the systems from natural and environmental hazards, and
unauthorized intrusion. Healthcare providers must fulfill the following standards. However, since most of
the implementation specifications in this category are addressable, healthcare providers have the flexibility
in determining how to comply with the requirements as long as these are internally designed and developed
as per the relevant SOP and published for all users to see and adhere to. Conformance to adherence may be
delegated to the Privacy Officer detailed in the Data Ownership chapter above.
The required physical standards are:

Page 27

DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY
•

The facility access control standard, to limit actual physical access to electronic information systems
and the facilities where they're located;

•

The workstation use standard, to control the physical attributes of a specific workstation or group of
workstations, to maximize security;

•

The workstation security standard, to implement physical safeguards to deter the unauthorized access
of a workstation; and

•

The device and media controls standard, to control the movement of any electronic media containing
ePHI from, to or within the facility.

Clinical Establishment: Clinical establishment means (1) a hospital, maternity home, nursing home,
dispensary, clinic, sanatorium or an institution by whatever name called that offers services, facilities
requiring diagnosis, treatment or care for illness, injury, deformity, abnormality or pregnancy in any
recognized system of medicine established and administered or maintained by any person or body of
persons, whether incorporated or not; or (2) a place established as an independent entity or part of an
establishment referred to above, in connection with the diagnosis or treatment of diseases where
pathological, bacteriological, genetic, radiological, chemical, biological investigations or other diagnostic or
investigative services with the aid of laboratory or other medical equipment, are usually carried on,

Disease Management: A type of product or service now being offered by many large pharmaceutical
companies to get them into broader healthcare services. Bundles use of prescription drugs with physician
and allied professionals, linked to large databases created by the pharmaceutical companies, to treat people
with specific diseases. The claim is that this type of service provides higher quality of care at more reasonable
price than alternative, presumably more fragmented, care. The development of such products by hugely
capitalized companies should be the entire indicator necessary to convince a provider of how the healthcare
market is changing. Competition is coming from every direction—other providers of all types, payers,
employers who are developing their own in-house service systems, the drug companies.

is the support of life-long, effective, high quality and safe integrated healthcare. [ISO 18308:2011]
Electronic Medical Records (EMR): The EMR could be considered as special case of the EHR, restricted in
scope to the medical domain or at least very much medically focused [ISO/TR 20514]. The Japanese
Association of Healthcare Information Systems (JAHIS) has defined a five-level hierarchy of the EMR;
Departmental EMR: contains a patient’s medical information entered by a single hospital department (e.g.
pathology, radiology, pharmacy); Inter-departmental EMR: contains a patient’s medical information from
two or more hospital departments; Hospital EMR: contains a patient’s clinical information from a particular
hospital; Inter-hospital EMR: contains a patient’s medical information from two or more hospitals; EHR:
longitudinal collection of health information from all sources. [Classification of EMR systems, JAHIS, V1.1,
Mar 1996]
Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI): Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) is any
protected health information (PHI) that is created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically. Electronic

Page 33

GLOSSARY
protected health information includes any medium used to store, transmit, or receive PHI electronically. The
following and any future technologies used for accessing, transmitting, or receiving PHI electronically are
covered. Media containing data at rest (data storage) like personal computers with internal hard drives used
at work, home, or traveling, external portable hard drives, including iPods and similar devices, magnetic tape,
removable storage devices, such as USB memory sticks, CDs, DVDs, and floppy disks, PDAs and smartphones
and data in transit, via wireless, Ethernet, modem, DSL, or cable network connections, Email, File transfer.

Encounter: A clinical encounter is defined by ASTM as "(1) an instance of direct provider/practitioner to
patient interaction, regardless of the setting, between a patient and a practitioner vested with primary
responsibility for diagnosing, evaluating or treating the patient’s condition, or both, or providing social
worker services. (2) A contact between a patient and a practitioner who has primary responsibility for
assessing and treating the patient at a given contact, exercising independent judgment." Encounter serves
as a focal point linking clinical, administrative and financial information. Encounters occur in many different
settings -- ambulatory care, inpatient care, emergency care, home health care, field and virtual (telemedicine).
Episode: An episode of care consists of all clinically related services for one patient for a discrete diagnostic
condition
from
the
onset
of
symptoms
until
the
treatment
is
complete
[http://www.ncmedsoc.org/non_members/pai/PAI-FinalWorkbookforVideo.pdf] Thus, for every new
problem or set of problems that a person visits his clinical care provider, it is considered a new episode.
Within that episode the patient will have one or many encounters with his clinical care providers till the
treatment for that episode is complete. Even before the resolution of an episode, the person may have a new
episode that is considered as a distinctly separate event altogether. Thus, there may be none, one or several
ongoing active episodes. All resolved episodes are considered inactive. Hence they become part of the
patient's past history. A notable point here is that all chronic diseases are considered active and may never
get resolved during the life-time of the person, e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc.
EPR: Broadly defined, a personal health record is the documentation of any form of patient information–
including medical history, medicines, allergies, visit history, or vaccinations–that patients themselves may
view, carry, amend, annotate, or maintain. Today, when we refer to PHRs, we typically mean an online
personal health record–which may variously be referred to as an ePHR, an Internet PHR, an Internet medical
record, or a consumer Internet Medical Record (CIMR). Generally, such records are maintained in a secure
and confidential environment, allowing only the individual, or people authorized by the individual, to access
the medical information. Not all electronic PHRs are Internet PHRs. PC-based PHRs may be set up to capture
medical information offline.
Evidence Based Medicine: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the integration of best research evidence with
clinical expertise to aid in the diagnosis and management of patients.
[F]
Family History: A list of the patient’s family medical history including the chronic medical problems of
parents, siblings, grandparents, etc.
