(a) an organisation shall provide clear, prominent, easily understandable, accessible
mechanisms for an individual to give consent in relation to the use of his personal
information;

of his personal information for all intended purposes that have been notified to him,
but this does not apply to sensitive personal information;

intermediary for a specified purpose, that individual will be deemed to have
consented to the use of that personal information by the receiving organisation for
the specified purpose;

information for the purpose of coverage or enrolment under an insurance, trust,
benefit or similar plan if the individual has an interest in or derives a benefit from

than is necessary for that use.
Security safeguards

(1) An organisation shall protect personal information that it holds with appropriate
safeguards against risk, including—
(a) loss;

9

PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION ACT 2016
and shall be subject to periodic review and reassessment.
Breach of security
14
(1) In case of a breach of security leading to the loss or unlawful destruction or
unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal information which is likely to adversely affect an
individual, the organisation responsible for that personal information shall, without undue delay—

(b) then notify any individual affected by the breach.
(2) The notification to the Commissioner under subsection (1) shall describe—
(a) the nature of the breach;
(b) its likely consequences for that individual; and

so that the Commissioner can determine whether to order the organisation to take further steps and

Transfer of personal information to an overseas third party
15
(1) When an organisation transfers to an overseas third party personal information for use
by that overseas third party on behalf of the organisation, or for the overseas third party’s own
business purposes, the organisation remains responsible for compliance with this Act in relation to
that personal information.
(2) Before making any such transfer, the organisation shall assess the level of protection
provided by the overseas third party for that personal information.
(3) When assessing the level of protection in subsection (2), an organisation shall consider
the level of protection afforded by the law applicable to such overseas third party and the Minister,
on the recommendation of the Commissioner, may designate any jurisdiction as providing a
comparable level of protection for the purposes of this section.
(4) If the organisation reasonably believes that the protection provided by the overseas
third party is comparable to the level of protection required by this Act, which may be evidenced by
the third party’s adoption of a certification mechanism recognised by the Commissioner, the
organisation may rely on such comparable level of protection while the personal information is being
used by the overseas third party.
(5) Where subsection (4) is not satisfied, the organisation shall employ contractual
mechanisms, corporate codes of conduct including binding corporate rules, or other means to ensure
that the overseas third party provides a comparable level of protection.
(6) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (5), an organisation may transfer personal
information to an overseas third party for use by that overseas third party on behalf of the
organisation or for the overseas third party’s own business purposes, if—.
(a) the transfer of the personal information is necessary for the establishment, exercise
or defence of legal rights; or

10

PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION ACT 2016
(b) the organisation assesses all the circumstances surrounding the transfer of
personal information to the overseas third party and reasonably considers the
transfer of personal information is—

information society service and—

children,
and consent is relied upon, subject to subsection (2) the organisation must obtain consent from a
parent or guardian before the personal information is collected or otherwise used.
(2) An organisation—
(a) shall be reasonably satisfied that consent obtained under subsection (1) is verifiable
so that it can be obtained only from the child’s parent or guardian; and
(b) shall establish procedures to verify whether the individual is a child when it is
reasonably likely that the organisation will use personal information about a child.
(3) When providing an information society service to a child, an organisation shall not seek
to obtain personal information from the child about other individuals, including in particular, personal
information relating to the professional activity of parents or guardians, financial information or
sociological information except that personal information about the identity and address of the child’s
parent or guardian may be used for the sole purpose of obtaining the consent under subsection (1).
(4) When complying with its obligations under section 9, an organisation delivering an
information society service to a child shall provide a privacy notice that is easily understandable and
appropriate to the age of the child.
(5) In legal proceedings brought against an organisation for failure to comply with a
requirement of this section, it is a defence for the organisation to prove that it had taken such care
as in all circumstances was reasonably necessary to comply with such requirement.

electronic communications; and

the organisation or of a third party that is of a commercial nature and it is not

appointed to act under an agreement or by a court;
(e) the disclosure of the personal information would reveal the intentions of the

the life or security of an individual;
(b) the personal information would reveal personal information about another
individual; or

or
(b) personal information kept for the purposes of, or obtained in the course of, the

an organisation may refuse to provide access to personal information if disclosure of the personal
information to the individual would be likely to prejudice the physical or mental health of the
individual.
(2) Where, under subsection (1), an organisation refuses to grant a request, the
organisation shall, if requested to do so by the individual, provide access to personal information
referred to in that subsection to a health professional, within the meaning of section 2 of the Bermuda
Health Council Act 2004, who has expertise in relation to the subject matter of the record, and the
health professional shall determine whether disclosure of the personal information to the individual
would be likely to prejudice the physical or mental health of the individual.
(3) Notwithstanding anything else in this section, in response to a request under subsection
(1), an organisation—
(a) may refuse to provide access to personal information by relying on section 17(2);
and

17(2)(b) or section 17(3)(b) or (c) or information which would be likely to prejudice the physical or
mental health of the individual from other personal information about the individual who requested
it, the organisation shall provide the individual with access to the other personal information after
redacting the former information or the information which would be likely to prejudice the physical
or mental health of the individual.
Rectification, blocking, erasure and destruction
19
(1) An individual may make a written request to an organisation to correct an error or
omission in any of his personal information which is under the control of the organisation.

(3) On receiving notification under subsection (2)(b) containing corrected personal
information, an organisation shall correct the personal information.
(4) An organisation shall obtain the consent of the writer of an opinion, including a
professional or expert opinion, before making a correction to or otherwise altering such opinion.

20
(1) In order to obtain access to his personal information or make a request for a correction

a written request to the organisation setting out sufficient detail to enable the organisation, with a
reasonable effort, to identify the personal information in respect of which the request is made.
(2) The applicant may ask for a copy of his personal information or ask to examine his
personal information.
(3) An organisation shall promptly acknowledge in writing receipt of a request, including
the date of the request, and the organisation shall at the same time inform the applicant, if there is
insufficient detail in the request, what information is required to complete his request.
(4) Subject to subsection (5), when a completed request has been received, an organisation
shall respond to an applicant not later than—
(a) 45 days from the day on which the organisation receives the applicant’s written

inform the applicant of the following—
(a) the reason for the extension; and
(b) the time when a response from the organisation can be expected.
(8) An organisation may charge an applicant who makes a request under section 17 or 18

information about the individual that is under the control of the organisation.
(9) A fee may not be charged under subsection (8) if the organisation is prevented from
charging such a fee by its professional regulatory body.
(10) If an organisation is intending to charge an applicant a fee for a service, the organisation
