Remarks :- The reason for the enactment of this Act is that nowadays the provision of services or
application of the computer networks, the internet, telecommunication networks, or general
satellite services are currently under the risk of Cyber Threats which may threaten national
security and public order in the country. In order to be able to simultaneously prevent or cope
with Cyber Threats, it is deemed appropriate to determine the characteristics of the mission or
services that are fundamental as critical information infrastructure, for both the government
agency and private organization, which are necessary to be prevented, coped with, and mitigated
from the risk of Cyber Threats, such that there is no adverse effects on security in varying
aspects, including to have the competent authorities responsible for proceeding with the relevant
tasks, coordinating between the government and private sectors regardless of the general situation
or the situation which severely threatens security, and establishing operational plan and standards
in maintaining cybersecurity in united and continuous manner. This will make the prevention and
coping with cyber threats efficient and thus the Act is necessary to be enacted.
