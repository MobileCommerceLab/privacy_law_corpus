Article 3

The following matters must be taken into account in deciding whether the
person is identified or identifiable –
(a)

the means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or another
person to identify the person, taking into account factors such as
the cost and amount of time required for identification in the light
of the available technology at the time of processing and
technological factors;

(b)

whether the personal data, despite pseudonymization, is capable of
being attributed to that person by the use of information other than
that kept separately for the purposes of pseudonimization.

In this Article “identifier” means a number or code (including any unique
number or code issued to the individual by a public authority) assigned to
an individual by a controller or processor for the purposes of its
operations that uniquely identifies the individual and includes location
data.

Pseudonymization
(1)

In this Law “pseudonymization” means the processing of personal data in
such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a
specific data subject without the use of additional information, and where
that additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical
and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not
attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

(2)

Pseudonymization may be achieved even though the additional
information that would enable the attribution of the data to a specific data
subject is retained within the controller’s organization provided that the
controller maintains records indicating who has access to that additional
information.

Application
(1)

This Law does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural
person in the course of a purely personal or household activity (but
applies to controllers or processors that provide the means for processing
personal data for such an activity).

(2)

This Law applies to the processing of personal data –
(a)

in the context of a controller or processor established in Jersey;

(b)

by a controller or processor not established in Jersey but who uses
equipment in Jersey for processing the data otherwise than for the
purposes of transit through Jersey; or

(c)

by a controller or processor not established in Jersey where the
processing –
(i)

relates to data subjects who are in Jersey, and

(ii)

is for the purpose of offering goods or services to persons in
Jersey or monitoring the behaviour of such persons.

L.3/2018

Article 7

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

(3)

The record keeping requirements do not apply in the case of
organizations with fewer than 250 employees unless the processing –

7

(a)

is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data
subjects;

(b)

is not occasional; or

(c)

includes special category data or relates to criminal convictions or
related security measures.

(4)

The Authority must take into account the specific needs of different sizes
of enterprise in the application of this Law.

(5)

Regulations may make further provision to modify or limit the
application of paragraph (1) in the case of organizations mentioned in
paragraph (3) and may amend the description of those organizations.

(6)

In this Article “record keeping requirements” means the requirements
with respect to record keeping set out in Articles 3(2) and 14(3).

Joint controllers
(1)

Where 2 or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of
the processing of personal data they are joint controllers.

(2)

Joint controllers must make arrangements between themselves in a
transparent manner so as to apportion their responsibilities in advance of
the processing of personal data.

(3)

Joint controllers must make a summary of the arrangements available to
data subjects and may designate a contact point to facilitate
communication between data subjects and joint controllers.

Data protection principles
(1)

(2)

9

Article 8

A controller must ensure that the processing of personal data in relation
to which the controller is the controller complies with the data protection
principles, namely that data are –
(a)

processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to
the data (“lawfulness, fairness and transparency”);

(b)

collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and once
collected, not further processed in a manner incompatible with
those purposes (“purpose limitation”);

(c)

adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
the purposes for which they are processed (“data minimization”);

(d)

accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, with reasonable
steps being taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate,
having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
erased or rectified without delay (“accuracy”);

(e)

kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no
longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data are
processed (“storage limitation”); and

(f)

processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the data,
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing
and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and
confidentiality”).

In relation to –
(a)

paragraph (1)(b), further processing for the purposes specified in
paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 (archiving and research) is not to be
taken as incompatible with the initial purposes for which the data
was collected;

(b)

paragraph (1)(e), personal data may be stored to the extent
necessary for the purposes specified in paragraphs 7 (other legal
obligations) and 17 of Schedule 2 subject to implementation of the
appropriate technical and organization measures required by this
Law in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data
subject.

Lawful processing
(1)

The processing of personal data that would otherwise be lawful is lawful
for the purposes of this Law only if it meets at least one of the conditions
specified in Schedule 2.

(2)

However, in the case of any processing of data that includes special
category data, it must meet at least one of the conditions mentioned in
Part 2 of Schedule 2.

Page - 17
L.3/2018

Article 10

10

Fair and transparent processing
(1)

To determine the fairness of processing personal data regard must be had
to whether the method by which the data are obtained, including in
particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived
or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be
processed.

(2)

Personal data are regarded as obtained fairly if they consist of
information obtained from a person who –

(3)

11

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

(a)

is authorized by or under any enactment to supply it; or

(b)

is required to supply it by or under any enactment or any
international agreement imposing an international obligation on
Jersey.

In order that personal data may be processed fairly and transparently, a
controller must –
(a)

facilitate the exercise of the rights of data subjects under Part 6;

(b)

act on a data subject’s request unless the controller is unable to do
so because the data subject cannot be identified or the processing is
exempted from such a requirement under this Law.

Consent to processing
(1)

In this Law, “consent”, in relation to the processing of a data subject’s
personal data, means any freely given, specific, informed and
unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she,
by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, whether orally or in
writing, signifies agreement to the processing of that data.

(2)

Consent –

(3)

(a)

is not informed unless the data subject is aware of the identity of
the controller who will process the data and the purposes of the
processing for which the personal data are intended;

(b)

is not freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given
to different personal data processing operations where it is
appropriate in the individual case.

To establish the presence of such consent, the controller must be able to
demonstrate that –
(a)

the request for consent was in a concise, intelligible and easily
accessible form;

(b)

where that request was in writing together with other matters, that
it was clearly distinguishable from those other matters;

(c)

where the request for consent was by electronic means, that it was
sought in a way that was not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of
the service for which the request was provided;

(d)

where consent was sought for the purposes of the performance of a
contract that includes the provision of a service –
(i)

consent was necessary for the performance of the contract,
or

Page - 18
L.3/2018

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

(ii)

if it was not necessary, the controller has advised the data
subject that he or she may refuse separate consent for the
provision of the service without prejudice to the
performance of the contract;

(e)

the data subject was informed of the right to withdraw consent at
any time and that it was as easy to withdraw consent as it was to
give it; and

(f)

the controller has made reasonable efforts to verify that the person
giving the consent is who the person claims to be, particularly
where that person claims to be the person authorized to consent for
a child under the age of 13.

(4)

A child under the age of 13 may not give valid consent to the processing
of his or her personal data by a controller for the purposes of an
information society service but valid consent on behalf of that child may
be given by a person with parental responsibility for him or her.

(5)

Consent is taken to cover all processing activities carried out for the same
purpose for which it is given and separate consent is required for each
separate purpose.

(6)

The States may make Regulations –
(a)

(b)

12

Article 12

amending the age of consent in paragraphs (3)(f) or (4), providing
exceptions to the inability of the child to consent and making
further provision as to the steps that the controller must take to
verify –
(i)

the age and identity of the child and any person purporting to
given consent on his or her behalf, and

(ii)

that the person has actually given consent;

governing the effect of consent where personal data is to be used
for the purposes of scientific research.

Information to be provided to data subject
(1)

A controller must ensure as far as practicable that where personal data
have been obtained by the controller from the data subject, the data
subject is provided with, or has made readily available to him or her, the
specified information at the same time as the data are obtained.

(2)

Where personal data were not obtained from the data subject, the
controller must ensure that the specified information is provided or made
readily available to the data subject before the relevant time except
where –

(3)

(a)

the data were are already in his or her possession;

(e)

the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data (if
any);

(f)

where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer
personal data to a third country or international organization and
whether or not there is an adequate level of protection for the rights
and freedoms of data subjects within the meaning of Article 66;

(g)

the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is
not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;

(h)

information concerning the rights of data subjects under Part 6, to
the extent that these apply;

(i)

where the processing is based on consent, the existence of the right
to withdraw consent under Article 11(3)(e);

(j)

the existence of any automated decision-making, as referred to in
Article 38, and any meaningful information about the logic
involved in such decision-making as well as the significance and
the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data
subject;

(k)

a statement of the right to complain to the Authority;

(l)

whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual
requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as
well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal
data and the possible consequences of failing to provide such data;

(m)

where the personal data are not obtained directly from the data
subject, information identifying the source of the data;

(n)

any further information that is necessary, having regard to the

(7)

13

Article 13

may be supplemented by standardized machine-readable icons, and
if so, the use of such icons is subject to such requirements that the
Minister may, by Order, prescribe.

Paragraph (2) does not apply if the controller believes that –
(a)

providing the specified information is impossible, would involve a
disproportionate effort on the part of the controller, or is likely to
prejudice the objectives of the processing and the controller
records the reasons for its belief and retains this record while it
retains the data; or

(b)

the recording of the information to be contained in the data, or the
disclosure of the data by the controller, is necessary for compliance
with any legal obligation to which the controller is subject, other
than an obligation imposed by contract; or

(c)

the data are held subject to an obligation of professional secrecy
regulated by law (whether in Jersey or elsewhere).

Where the controller does not provide the information the controller must
take appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s rights and
interests, which may include making the specified information publicly
available.

Purposes of processing
(1)

Paragraph (2) applies where personal data are processed for a purpose
other than that for which they were collected without the consent of the
data subject and such processing is not authorized by the relevant law.

(2)

Where this paragraph applies, the controller must assess whether that
processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data
were collected by taking into account factors that include –

(3)

(a)

any link between the purposes for which the data have been
collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;

(b)

the context in which the data have been collected, in particular
regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller;

(c)

the nature of the data, in particular whether it is special category
data;

(d)

the possible consequences of the intended further processing for
data subjects; and

(e)

the existence of appropriate safeguards.

Where the controller intends to process personal data further, for a
purpose other than that for which the data were collected, the controller
must provide the data subject with information on that other purpose,
together with the specified information referred to in Article 12(4) before
that further processing takes place.

15

Data protection by design and by default
(1)

16

Article 15

A controller must, both at the time of the determination of the means for
processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate
technical and organizational measures that are designed to –
(a)

implement the data protection principles in an effective manner;
and

(b)

integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing to meet the
requirements of this Law and protect the rights of data subjects.

(2)

In determining whether or not a measure is appropriate for the purposes
of this Article, regard must be had to the state of technological
development, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context
and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and
severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the
processing.

(3)

The technical and organizational measures must ensure as far as
practicable that, by default –
(a)

only personal data that are necessary for each specific purpose of
the processing are processed; and

(b)

personal data are not made accessible to an indefinite number of
natural persons without the data subject’s consent or other lawful
authority.

(4)

of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility.

(5)

Adherence to a code or evidence of certification may provide evidence
that an individual controller has or has not contravened paragraph (1).

Data protection impact assessments required for high risk processing
(1)

Where a type of processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
and freedoms of natural persons, a controller must carry out an
assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the
protection of personal data before the processing, to be known as a data
protection impact assessment.

(2)

In assessing the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, regard
must be had in particular to the use of new technologies, and the nature,
scope, context and purposes of the processing.

(3)

Where more than one processing operation is similar as to the degree of
risk involved, the risks may be assessed using a single assessment.

(4)

When carrying out a data protection impact assessment, the controller
must seek the advice of the data protection officer, where one is
appointed.

(5)

A data protection impact assessment is, in particular, required in the case
of –
(a)

a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating
to natural persons that is based on automated processing, and on

Page - 23
L.3/2018

Article 16

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning, or
similarly significantly affecting, those persons;

(6)

(b)

the processing of special category data on a large scale; or

(c)

a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large
scale.

A data protection impact assessment must contain the following
minimum requirements –
(a)

a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and
the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the
legitimate interest pursued by the controller;

(b)

an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the
processing operations in relation to the purposes;

(c)

an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons referred to in paragraph (1); and

(d)

the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards,
security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of
personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Law, taking
into account the rights and legitimate interests of any person.

(7)

The Authority may publish a list of the types of processing operation that
are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment and
those types of processing operation for which no data protection impact
assessment is required.

(8)

Where appropriate, the controller must seek the views of data subjects or
their representatives on the intended processing, without limiting the
protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing
operations.

(9)

Paragraphs (1) to (6) do not apply where –
(a)

processing in accordance with paragraphs 4 (public functions) and
7 (other legal obligations) of Schedule 2 has a legal basis and is
regulated by the relevant law; and

(b)

a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as
part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption
of that legal basis.

(10) The controller must review, and where appropriate, revise the data
protection impact assessment where –
(a)

there is a change in the risks posed to the rights and freedoms of
data subjects by the processing operations; or

(b)

the controller otherwise considers it necessary.

(11) A review under paragraph (10) must include a review of –

Prior consultation required for high risk processing
(1)

This Article applies where a data protection impact assessment indicates
that any processing would pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
natural persons in the absence of measures taken by the controller to
mitigate the risk.

(2)

Before starting the processing, the controller must consult the Authority
giving the following information in writing –

(3)

(4)

18

Article 17

(a)

where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller,
joint controllers and processors involved in the proposed
processing, in particular for processing within a group of
undertakings;

(b)

a copy of the data protection impact assessment;

(c)

the contact details of any data protection officer; and

(d)

any other information required by the Authority.

Where the Authority considers that the proposed processing would be in
contravention of this Law, in particular where the controller has
insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the Authority –
(a)

must give written notice of its opinion to the controller and, where
applicable to the processor; and

(b)

may exercise any power conferred on the Authority by this Law or
the Authority Law in relation to a contravention or potential
contravention of a requirement of this Law.

The Authority must give the notice required by paragraph (3)(a) –
(a)

without undue delay; and

(b)

in any event within 8 weeks of receiving the information from the
controller under paragraph (2).

(5)

The Authority may extend the period in paragraph (4)(b) by a further
6 weeks taking into account the complexity of the intended processing,
but in this case, the Authority must inform the controller and, where
applicable, the processor, of the extension and the reasons for it within
4 weeks of receiving the information from the controller under
paragraph (2).

(6)

If the Authority has requested information from the controller or the
processor for the purposes of the consultation, any period of time spent
awaiting the provision of that information must be discounted from each
period specified in paragraph (4)(b) or (5).

Prior consultation required for high risk legislation
(1)

This Article applies where any draft Law or Regulations, or any proposal
under Article 31 of the States of Jersey Law 20056, is or are to be lodged
au Greffe in accordance with standing orders7 made under Article 48 of
that Law, or any draft Jersey legislation that a Minister is responsible for
making is to be made –

19

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

(a)

that would require, authorize or otherwise relate to the processing
of personal data; and

(b)

taking into account the nature, scope and purposes of the
processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and
freedom of natural persons.

(2)

The Minister or other person responsible for the lodging or making, as the
case may be, must consult the Authority by means of a written notice, to
be known as a “consultation notice”.

(3)

The consultation notice must include any data protection impact
assessment carried out in connection with the proposed processing of
personal data mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) and, unless included within
such an assessment –
(a)

a systematic description of the proposed processing (including the
means of processing), its purposes and the objectives of the
provisions of the legislation effecting it;

(b)

an assessment of the necessity (including proportionality) of the
proposed processing in relation to those objectives;

(c)

an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data
subjects posed by the processing; and

(d)

the measures envisaged to address those risks, including
appropriate safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to
ensure the protection of personal data and demonstrate compliance
with this Law, taking into account the rights and freedoms of data
subjects.

Appointment of processor
(1)

Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the
controller must use only processors that provide sufficient guarantees to
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a
manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Law and ensure
the protection of the rights of the data subject.

(2)

The processor must not engage another processor without prior specific
or general written authorization of the controller, and where the
authorization is general, the processor must inform the controller of any
intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other
processors, so that the controller may object to the changes.

(3)

Processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other legal
act under the relevant law, that –

(4)

(a)

is binding on the processor with regard to the controller; and

(b)

sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the
nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and
categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the
controller.

The contract or other legal act must, in particular, stipulate that the
processor –

L.3/2018

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

Article 19

(a)

processes the personal data only on documented instructions from
the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to
a third country or an international organization, unless required to
do so by the relevant law to which the processor is subject, in
which case the processor must inform the controller of that legal
requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such
information being given;

(b)

ensures that persons authorized to process the personal data have
committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an
appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;

(c)

takes all measures required by Article 21;

(d)

respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs (2), (6) and (7) for
engaging another processor;

(e)

taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the
controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures,
insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's
obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject’s
rights set out in Part 6;

(f)

assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations
under Articles 16, 20 and 21, taking into account the nature of
processing and the information available to the processor;

(g)

at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal
data to the controller after the end of the provision of services
relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless the
relevant law requires storage of the personal data;

(h)

makes available to the controller all information necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this
Article and allows for and contributes to audits, including
inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor
mandated by the controller.

(5)

With respect to paragraph (4)(h), the processor must immediately inform
the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Law or other
data protection provisions of the relevant law.

(6)

Where the processor engages another processor the obligations set out in
paragraph (4) must, in particular, provide sufficient guarantees to
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a
manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Law and
where that other processor fails to fulfil those obligations, the initial
processor remains fully liable to the controller for the performance of that
other processor’s obligations.

(7)

Adherence to a code or evidence of certification may provide evidence
that an individual processor has complied with paragraphs (1) and (6).

(8)

Without limiting the provisions of an individual contract between the
controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to
in paragraph (4) may be based, in whole or in part, on standard
contractual clauses as referred to in paragraph (9).

writing.
20

Notification of breach
(1)

In the case of a personal data breach, the controller must, without undue
delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become
aware of it, notify the personal data breach in writing to the Authority in
the manner required by the Authority, unless the personal data breach is
unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

(2)

If the notification to the Authority is not made within 72 hours, it must be
accompanied by reasons for the delay.

(3)

The notification referred to in paragraph (1) must –
(a)

describe the nature of the personal data breach including where
possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects
concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal
data records concerned;

(b)

communicate the name and contact details of the data protection
officer or other contact point where more information can be
obtained;

(c)

describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and

(d)

describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the
controller to address the personal data breach, including, where
appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

(4)

Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the
same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue
further delay.

(5)

The controller must document any personal data breaches, including the
facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial
action taken, in such detail as will enable the Authority to verify
compliance with this Article.

(6)

If the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
and freedoms of natural persons, the controller must communicate the
breach to the data subject –

(7)

(a)

without undue delay; and

(b)

in clear and plain language describing the nature of the personal
data breach; and

(c)

giving the information referred to in paragraph (3)(b) to (d).

Despite paragraph (6) communication is not required if –
(a)

the controller has implemented proportionate technical and
organizational protection measures, and those measures were
applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in
particular measures that render the personal data unintelligible to
any person who is not authorized to access it, such as encryption;

Page - 28
L.3/2018

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

(8)

Article 21

(b)

the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the
high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in
paragraph (6) is no longer likely to materialize; or

(c)

it would involve disproportionate effort, in which case there must
instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the
data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.

If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach
to the data subject, the Authority, having considered the likelihood of the
personal data breach resulting in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
natural persons, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the
conditions referred to in paragraph (7) are met.

PART 4

PART 6
RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS
27

Handling of requests by data subjects
(1)

Where so requested by the data subject under the following provisions of
this Part, a controller must take such action as the controller considers
appropriate, and provide information on the action taken to that data
subject, without undue delay and in any event within 4 weeks of receipt
of the request.

(2)

The period of 4 weeks may be extended by a further 8 weeks where
necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests,
and the controller must inform the data subject of any such extension
within 4 weeks of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the
delay.

information must be provided by electronic means where possible, unless
otherwise requested by the data subject.

(4)

If the controller does not take any action under paragraph (1), the
controller must inform the data subject without delay and at the latest
within 4 weeks of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking
action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with the Authority
and seeking a judicial remedy.

(5)

Specified information provided under Article 12 and any communication
or other action taken under Article 20 or any provision of this Part must
be provided free of charge.

(6)

Where requests from a data subject are manifestly vexatious, unfounded
or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the burden
of proving which is on the controller, the controller may either –
(a)

charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs
of providing the information or communication or taking the other
action requested; or

(b)

refuse to act on the request.

(7)

Without limiting Article 5, where the controller has reasonable doubts
concerning the identity of the individual making any request under this
Part, the controller may request the provision of additional information
necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject and is not obliged to
enable the individual’s rights to be exercised unless supplied with that
information.

(8)

The controller must communicate any rectification or erasure of personal
data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with
Articles 31 to 33 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been
disclosed, unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort,
and must inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject
requests it.

(9)

Regulations may amend this Article so as to vary any of the requirements
specified, or any provision as to the manner in which requests to exercise
those requirements must or may be made.

Right of access requests: general
(1)

An individual is entitled to be informed by a controller whether personal
data of which that individual is the data subject are being processed by or
on behalf of that controller, and, if that is the case, to be given
information as to –

the purposes for which they are being or are to be processed by or
on behalf of that controller;

(b)

the categories of personal data concerned;

(c)

the recipients or classes of recipients to whom they are or may be
disclosed by or on behalf of that controller, in particular recipients
in third countries or international organizations;

Page - 35
L.3/2018

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

(d)

where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data
will be stored or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that
period;

(e)

the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification
or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal
data concerning the data subject under Articles 31 to 33 or to
object to such processing;

(f)

the right to lodge a complaint with the Authority;

(g)

where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any
available information as to their source; and

(h)

the existence of automated decision-making referred to in
Article 38(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful
information about the logic involved, as well as the significance
and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data
subject.

(2)

Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an
international organization, the data subject has the right to be informed of
the appropriate safeguards under Article 67 relating to the transfer.

(3)

Without limiting the rights and freedoms of other persons, a data subject
is entitled to obtain from the relevant controller the following in
intelligible form –

(4)

(a)

the information constituting any personal data of which the
individual is the data subject and a copy of that data; and

(b)

further copies of those data on payment of a fee of such amount as
will enable the controller to cover its administrative costs.

If the supplying of information under this Article would require the
disclosing of information relating to another individual who can be
identified from that information, the controller is not obliged to enable
such information to be supplied unless –
(a)

the other individual has consented to the disclosure of the
information to the person making the request; or

(b)

it is reasonable in all the circumstances to do so without the
consent of the other individual.

(5)

In paragraph (4), the reference to information relating to another
individual includes a reference to information identifying that individual
as the source of the information sought in the request.

(6)

Paragraph (4) is not to be construed as excusing a controller from
communicating so much of the information sought in the request as can
be communicated without disclosing the identity of the other individual
concerned, whether by the omission of names or other identifying
particulars or otherwise.

(7)

For the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), regard must be had, in particular,

any express refusal of consent by the other individual.

Right of access requests: information contained in health records
(1)

(2)

A controller who is not a health professional must not, on the ground of
the exemption in Article 61(2), refuse a request under Article 28 for
information contained in a health record unless –

after receiving the request, the controller consulted the appropriate
health professional on the question whether the exemption applies
and obtained his or her a written opinion that it does so apply; or

(b)

the following conditions are satisfied –
(i)

the controller consulted a health professional before
receiving the request,

the controller obtained a written opinion from the health
professional that the exemption applied to the information.

The conditions referred to in paragraph (1)(b) are taken not to be satisfied
if the opinion was obtained –

before the start of the period of 26 weeks that ends at the beginning
of the 4-week period referred to in Article 27(1) in respect of the
request; or

(b)

within that period of 26 weeks but it is reasonable in all the
circumstances to consult the appropriate health professional again.

(3)

A controller who is not a health professional must not supply information
contained in a health record in response to a request under Article 28
unless the controller has first consulted the appropriate health
professional on the question whether the exemption set out in
Article 61(2) applies with respect to the information.

(4)

Paragraph (3) does not operate in relation to a request to the extent that
the request relates to information that the controller is satisfied has
previously been supplied to the data subject or is already within the
knowledge of the data subject.

(5)

Paragraph (3) does not operate in relation to a request if the following
conditions are satisfied –
(a)

the controller consulted a health professional before receiving the
request;

(b)

the health professional was the health professional who would, if
the controller had carried out the consultation under paragraph (3),
have been the appropriate health professional;

(c)

the controller obtained a written opinion from the health
professional that the exemption set out in Article 61(2) did not

Page - 37
L.3/2018

Article 30

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

apply with respect to the information that is the subject of the
request.
(6)

30

31

In this Article, “appropriate health professional” means –
(a)

if the controller is the Minister for Social Security and the personal
data are processed in connection with the exercise of the functions
conferred on him or her in respect of health insurance or social
security, a health professional who appears to the controller to have
the necessary experience and qualifications to advise on the
matters to which the information relates;

(b)

in other cases, the health professional who appears to the controller
to be currently or to have been most recently responsible for the
clinical care of the data subject in connection with the matters to
which the information relates.

(7)

If, in the application of paragraph (6), more than one health professional
would be chosen, the appropriate health professional is the one who
appears to the controller to be the most suitable to advise on the matters
to which the information relates.

(8)

If, in the application of paragraph (6), no health professional would be
chosen, the appropriate health professional is a health professional who
appears to the controller to have the necessary experience and
qualifications to advise on the matters to which the information relates.

Treatment of right of access requests
(1)

Regulations may provide that, in such cases as may be prescribed, a
request under Article 28 for information referred to in any provision of
Article 28 is to be treated as a request for information referred to in any
other provision of Article 28.

(2)

Article 28(1)(h) is not to be regarded as requiring the provision of
information as to the logic involved in any decision-taking to the extent
that the information constitutes a trade secret.

(3)

Information supplied under Article 28 must be supplied by reference to
the data in question at the time when the request for the data is received,
except that account may be taken of any amendment or deletion made
between that time and the time when the information is supplied, being an
amendment or deletion that would have been made regardless of the
receipt of the request.

(4)

For the purposes of Article 28(5) and (7), another individual can be
identified from the information being disclosed if the individual can be
identified from that information, or from that and any other information
that, in the reasonable belief of the controller, is likely to be in, or to
come into, the possession of the data subject making the request.

Right to rectification
(1)

A data subject who disputes the accuracy or completeness of personal
data may make a written request to the controller to rectify or change the

Page - 38
L.3/2018

Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018

Article 32

personal data, stating the inaccuracy or explaining why the personal data
is incomplete.
(2)

Before complying with a request under paragraph (1) the controller may
require from the data subject such further information as may be
appropriate regarding the purposes of processing the data in order to
verify that the requested rectification or completion is accurate.

(3)

On consideration of a request under paragraph (1), the controller must –

(4)

32

(a)

where the controller is able, by taking reasonable steps, to confirm
that the personal data are inaccurate or incomplete, rectify or
complete the data;

(b)

where the controller is satisfied as to the accuracy and
completeness of the personal data, take no action regarding the
data; or

(c)

where it is not reasonable to expect the controller to confirm or
verify the accuracy or completeness of the personal data, add to the
personal data a statement to the effect that the data subject disputes
the accuracy or (as the case may be) completeness of that personal
data.

Without limiting paragraph (2), before taking any action under
paragraph (3)(c) the controller may request that the data subject provide a
written statement that includes information as to the additional data
needed to rectify or complete it.

Right to erasure
(1)

(2)

Where so required by the data subject the controller must erase personal
data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies –
(a)

the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;

(b)

the data subject withdraws consent given under paragraph 1 or 6 of
Schedule 2 and there is no other legal ground for the processing;

(c)

the data subject objects to the processing –
(i)

under Article 35, where there are no overriding legitimate
grounds or reasons of public interest for the processing, or

(ii)

General principles for cross-border data transfers
(1)

A controller or a processor must not transfer personal data for processing
or in circumstances where the controller or processor knew or should
have known that it will be processed after the transfer to a third country
or an international organization, unless that country or organization
ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of
data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.

(2)

The level of protection referred to in paragraph (1) is adequate if –

(3)

67

(a)

the Commission has so decided, by means of an implementing act
under Article 45 of the GDPR;

(b)

there are appropriate safeguards in place that meet the
requirements of Article 66; or

Transfer subject to appropriate safeguards
(1)

In the absence of an adequacy decision under Article 45 of the GDPR, a
controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an
international organization only if the controller or processor has provided
appropriate safeguards in accordance with this Article, and on condition
that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data
subjects comparable to those under this Law are available in that country
or organization.

(2)

The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph (1) may be provided
for, without requiring any specific authorization from the Authority, by –

binding corporate rules approved by the Authority as complying
with Schedule 4 or approved by another competent supervisory
authority under Article 46 of the GDPR, or equivalent statutory

country or international organization to apply the appropriate
safeguards, including as regards data subjects’ rights; or
(e)

(3)

(4)

the controller, processor or recipient in the third country having
been certified in accordance with a certification mechanism either
provided for in Regulations under Article 80 or approved by
another competent supervisory authority under Article 42 of the
GDPR.

Subject to specific authorization from the Authority and where there is a
mechanism for data subjects to enforce their data subject rights and
obtain effective legal remedies against the controller, processor or
recipient of that personal data in the jurisdiction concerned, the
appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph (1) may also be provided
for by –
(a)

contractual clauses between the controller or processor and the
controller, processor or the recipient of the personal data in the
third country or international organization; or

(b)

where both the transferor and the controller, processor or recipient
of the personal data in the third country or international
organization concerned are public authorities, provisions in
administrative arrangements between those public authorities that
include enforceable and effective data subject rights.
