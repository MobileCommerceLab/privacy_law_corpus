individual under section 60A(1) does not terminate the
contract of employment of the former Commissioner or any
other individual employed by the States of Guernsey in the
office of the Data Protection Commissioner in force
immediately before the commencement of this Law; on the
commencement of this Law, any such contract has effect as if
originally made between the individual so employed and the
Authority.

2.

Without prejudice to subparagraph (1), but subject to
subparagraph (4), on the commencement of this Law –
all the rights, powers, duties and liabilities of the States
(a)
of Guernsey under or in connection with any contract
of employment described in subparagraph (1) are
transferred by virtue of this Schedule to the Authority,
and
(b)
anything done before the commencement of this Law
by or in relation to the States of Guernsey in respect of
that contract or an individual employed under that
contract is deemed to have been done by or in relation
to the Authority.
Subparagraph (2) does not transfer or otherwise affect the
liability of any person to be prosecuted for, convicted of and
sentenced for any offence.
If, within the period of 3 months after the commencement of
this Law, the employee gives the Authority written notice that
the employee objects to becoming employed by the Authority,
upon the Authority's receipt of the notice –
(a)
the employee's deemed employment by the Authority
is deemed to be terminated,
(b)
the employee is deemed to revert to being employed
by the States of Guernsey, instead of the Authority, and
(c)
the employee must not be treated for any purpose as
having been dismissed by either the Authority or the
States of Guernsey.
Subparagraphs (1) and (4) are without prejudice to any right of
an employee (arising apart from subparagraph (4)) to
terminate the employee's contract of employment without
notice if a substantial change is made in the employee's
working conditions to the employee's detriment; but no such
right arises by reason only that, under those subparagraphs,
the identity of the employer changes unless the employee
shows that, in all the circumstances, the change is a significant
change and is to the employee's detriment.
Effect of deemed employment by the Authority on collective
agreements.
Where immediately before the commencement of this Law
there exists a collective agreement made by or on behalf of the

Amendment

States of Guernsey with a trade union recognised by the States
of Guernsey in respect of any employee whose contract of
employment is preserved by paragraph 1(1), then on and after
the commencement of this Law –
that agreement, in its application in relation to the
(a)
employee, has effect as if made by or on behalf of the
Authority with that trade union; and accordingly
anything done under or in connection with it in its
application as aforesaid by or in relation to the States of
Guernsey before the commencement of this Law is
deemed to have been done by or in relation to the
Authority, and
any order made in respect of that agreement, in its
(b)
application in relation to the employee, has effect as if
the Authority were a party to the agreement.
3.
(1)

(2)

(3)

Non-application of paragraphs 1 and 2 to occupational
pension schemes.
Neither paragraph 1 nor 2 applies –
to any part of a contract of employment or collective
(a)
agreement that relates to an occupational pension
scheme of a description set out in section 157C(1)(e) of
the Income Tax (Guernsey) Law, 1975, or
to any rights, powers, duties or liabilities under or in
(b)
connection with any such contract or subsisting by
virtue of any such agreement and relating to such a
scheme or otherwise arising in connection with a
person's employment and relating to such a scheme.
For the purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (3), any provisions
of an occupational pension scheme which do not relate to
benefits for old age, invalidity or survivors must not be treated
as part of the scheme.
An employee whose contract of employment is transferred by
virtue of paragraph 1(1) is not entitled to bring a claim against
either the Authority or the States of Guernsey for –
(a)
breach of contract, or
constructive unfair dismissal under Part II of the

insofar as the alleged breach of contract or dismissal (as the
case may be) occurred before the commencement of this Law.

(1)

(2)

Dismissal of employee because of transfer of employment
contract.
If any individual deemed to be employed by the Authority
under section 60A(1) is dismissed at any time before or after
the commencement of this Law, the dismissal of the employee
must be regarded for the purposes of Part II of the
Employment Protection (Guernsey) Law, 1998 as having been
unfair if the reason for the dismissal (or, if more than one, the
principal reason) was the transfer of the employment contract
under paragraph 1(1) and (2) or a reason connected with it;
and the provisions of that Law apply accordingly.
Subparagraph (1) is subject to the provisions of the
Employment Protection (Guernsey) Law, 1998.

5.

The Law to prevail in case of conflict.
If there is any conflict between the terms and conditions of an
employment contract having effect in accordance with this
Schedule on the one hand, and a provision of this Law or any
Ordinance or subordinate legislation made under this Law on
the other hand, the Law, Ordinance or (as the case may be)
subordinate legislation prevails.
