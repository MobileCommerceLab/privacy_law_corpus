1. Introduction
While recent developments in technology and wide-scale adoption of online digital services
have benefited the financial sector, they have also increased the cyber risks we face. The
growing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks have reinforced the need for
organizations to have strong cybersecurity controls to mitigate cyber risks.
As per Article 15 of Law No. 32 of 1968, Central Bank of Kuwait is responsible to supervise
the Kuwaiti banking sector. Accordingly, the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) recognizes the
need for the banking sector to improve its resilience to cyber attacks. To support this objective,
CBK is institutes this Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which applies to all Regulated Entities
within the banking sector to ensure consistent management of cybersecurity in the banking
sector. The CSF defines the cybersecurity strategy and regulatory framework to enhance the
cybersecurity of the sector’s systems, operations, infrastructure, and data.

1.1 Definitions
CSF defines the following terms for consistent reference and interpretation:

‘Cybersecurity’ is the Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
and/or information systems through the cyber medium. In addition, other properties, such as
authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved. 1
‘Cyber Resilience’ is the ability to continue to carry out mission by anticipating and adapting
to cyber threats and other relevant changes in the environment and by withstanding,
containing and rapidly recovering from cyber incidents.2
‘Cyber Risk’ is the combination of the probability of an event occurring within the realm of an
organization’s information assets, computer and communication resources and the
consequences of that event.3

1.2 Drivers
The CSF exists in the context of several strategic drivers that fundamentally influence the
Kuwaiti banking sector as identified below:
●

Compliance with CBK Law 32 of Year 1968 and Law 20 of Year 2014: CBK
understands the need for managing an elevated and rapidly evolving cyber threats
to financial markets as an integral part of CBK’s core responsibility of managing
the stability and integrity of the Kuwaiti Banking sector.

●

Expanding role of CBK in managing the stability of Payment Systems and
FinTechs: The introduction of instructions for electronic payments in the State of
Kuwait increased CBK’s responsibilities.

●

Increasing dependencies on third parties: As Regulated Entities are
increasingly dependent on third parties for facilities, infrastructure, technology
management, and operational support, appropriate controls are vital to ensure the
stability and resilience of Regulated Entities.

●

The need for greater visibility and regulatory supervision: With the increasing
number of high profile cyber attacks across the banking sector, CBK requires
greater visibility of the effectiveness (i.e. maturity) of the cybersecurity controls in
operation across the banking sector.

●

The need to maintain the resilience of the banking sector as it adapts to the
rapid advancement of and increased reliance on technology: With the
continuous and rapid introduction of new technologies to the banking sector, there
is a need to manage the evolving cyber threats.

●

Alignment with and execution of the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS)
for the State of Kuwait: The NCSS identifies and outlines its vision for
cybersecurity for the State of Kuwait. Compliance with the CSF will assist
Regulated Entities in managing their cyber risks in alignment with the NCSS.

●

The need for continuous improvement due to the increase in frequency and
sophistication of cyber attacks: The increased number of cyber attacks and their
growing complexity continues to expose vulnerabilities, and highlights the need for
continuous improvement in cybersecurity controls.

2. Cybersecurity Framework Overview
The CSF defines and addresses the objectives by establishing multiple components that work
together to improve the cybersecurity of Regulated Entities and the sector as a whole.

2.1 Objectives
The objectives of the CSF are:
●

To improve cyber resilience within the Kuwaiti banking sector by defining
requirements that seek to enhance capabilities, preparedness, cooperation,
information sharing, and standardization of the Regulated Entities’ cybersecurity
approaches;

●

To enhance the maturity of the cybersecurity controls in place within the sector as
well as provide a mechanism to inform and mandate strategic security initiatives
required to improve cybersecurity maturity; and

●

To ensure that CBK executes its sectoral responsibility to provide appropriate
levels of informed supervision and regulation for the improvement of cyber
resilience in the sector.

2.2 Framework Core Principles
The CSF defines three core principles that enhances the banking sector’s cybersecurity and
resilience capabilities:
●

Governance, Risk management and Compliance (section 2.2.1)

●

Collaboration (section 2.2.2)

●

Continual Improvement (section 2.2.3)

Figure 1: Cybersecurity Framework

2.2.1 Governance, Risk Management and Compliance
CBK identifies Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC) as one of the core
principles of the CSF. The underlying GRC components identified in the following sections will
enable Regulated Entities to integrate and coordinate Governance, Risk and Compliance
initiatives within their business processes. A holistic view of the current GRC posture with
respect to cybersecurity will enable the management teams of Regulated Entities to make
informed decisions to effectively manage cyber risks.
Regulated Entities’ Board of Directors are accountable for the cybersecurity of their
organizations however, they may delegate responsibility for delivering effective cybersecurity
to individuals or entities within their organization who have the appropriate qualifications and
expertise.

2.2.1.2 Risk Management
Risk management is an ongoing process to identify, assess, and address the risks.
Accordingly, Regulated Entities shall conduct regular risk assessments to identify and manage
cyber risks. Regulated Entities shall define criteria for risk acceptance and mitigation in their
policies, and document all risks accordingly.
Regulated Entities shall align their risk management policies and procedures with the
applicable areas of the CSF. Such alignment must prioritize the implementation of policies,
procedures, and resources to improve cyber resilience.
While the CSF defines the cybersecurity baselines for Kuwaiti banking sector as a minimum
security controls that must be complied with, Regulated Entities are encouraged to implement
additional enhanced controls based on their risk appetite. Regulated Entities are also
encouraged to collaborate across the sector on such enhanced controls to improve overall
sector risk posture and may influence future updates to CSF baselines.
2.2.1.3 Compliance
Compliance is the process of conforming to stated requirements, applicable laws, regulations,
internal and external standards, contracts, strategies, and policies. Regulated Entities’
compliance with laws and regulations promotes the alignment of cybersecurity practices
across the sector and enhances collaboration to increase the sector’s overall maturity. As
such, Regulated Entities shall comply with the CSF and applicable national and international
laws, regulations and standards. Regulated Entities shall be able to demonstrate their:
●

Identification and documentation of applicable national and international security

2.2.2 Collaboration
As the technology, landscape evolves with fast changing innovations that disrupt the financial
market leading to increasing cyber risks and threats. The need to foster collaboration is
essential to improve skills, knowledge sharing, and leadership. CBK strongly encourages the
Regulated Entities to closely collaborate to enable the Kuwaiti banking sector to combat the
rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape.
2.2.2.1 Information Security Working Group
The CSF establishes the Information Security Working Group (ISWG) as a forum for
collaborative discussions on cybersecurity controls, and the maturity of the Kuwaiti banking
sector. The ISWG shall be a permanent forum where the Kuwaiti banking sector can
collaborate and share insights into cybersecurity risks, trends and best practices. The ISWG
may also engage and undertake activities of continual improvement.
The objectives of the ISWG include the following:
1. Provide a forum for the collaborative exchange of information, knowledge and
intelligence to assist ISWG members to better manage cybersecurity risk.
2. Facilitate discussions on the latest cybersecurity trends and technologies that
affect the Kuwaiti banking sector.
3. Provide support and guidance on cybersecurity initiatives and assist in complying
with regulations.
4. Provide a robust platform to inform and undertake strategic initiatives that are
relevant to cybersecurity risk.
5. Facilitate the analysis and monitoring of necessary safeguards and actions in
response to cyber incidents.
6. Act as a forum to coordinate with external entities, such as the Government and
other entities.

2.2.2.2 Sectoral Initiatives, Awareness and Training
The CSF, recognizes the volatile nature of cyber risks and their impact on the banking sector,
envisages a need for undertaking collaborative sectoral initiatives that will help to address
awareness, training needs and specific cybersecurity concerns based on the current and
evolving threat landscape and sectoral maturity. These initiatives aim to increase awareness
and to train Regulated Entities (and the public, where appropriate) on specific issues, using a
range of tools such as awareness campaigns, structured training programs and simulations.
2.2.2.3 Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing
This component of the CSF defines the strategy and functions of a Cyber Threat Intelligence
Sharing (CTIS) to facilitate collaboration between Regulated Entities in the discovery,
analysis, understanding, and sharing of information about cyber threats arising out of global,
regional, and local events. This collaboration, supported by various threat intelligence feeds,
shall promote proactive measures for continuous improvement of cybersecurity controls by
Regulated Entities.
The CTIS Strategy establishes the structure, considerations, policies and procedures for
CTIS. The CTIS strategy elaborates the requirement of CTIS platform for collaboration along
with a Sectoral Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to provide valuable
analysis to support incident response efforts of an entity, and to safeguard the other Regulated
Entities by sharing cyber intelligence.
The cyber threat intelligence information shall be classified as strategic, operational, or tactical
depending on whether the information is relevant against immediate threats, or to improve
the protection of Regulated Entities against possible threat, or if it assists the Kuwaiti Banking
Sector to visualize the risks related to strategic business trends.
The CTIS process for Kuwaiti Banking sector is illustrated as below, and is elaborated in the
CTIS Strategy.

Cybersecurity Framework for Kuwait Banking Sector

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 11 of 27

Figure 2: Cyber Threat Information Sharing Process

CBK and CTIS Management shall undertake necessary efforts to establish a culture of trust,
sharing and caring. The CTIS Strategy is based on the principles that entities and individuals
who share information:
•

enable better protection of the Banking Sector and the State of Kuwait; and

•

shall only be judged for how they responded and reacted to threats and incidents
(i.e. being opened and sharing rather than hiding and letting others also be
attacked).

The cyber threat intelligence labelling methodology identified in the CTIS strategy is based on
the following principles to assist in protecting identity of reporting entity and promoting sectoral
collaboration with established trust:
•

all Regulated Entities shall abide by the usage and sharing method defined for
each label category; and

•

only the originator of the information can determine the final label of intelligence.

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 12 of 27

CBK will assess the sectoral criticality and requirement to promote establishment of a sectoral
Security Operations Center (SOC) on long-term plan for centralizing the operations of
essential sectoral monitoring and for invoking the timely identification, communication,
stakeholder engagement, and management of cyber incidents within the sector.

2.2.3 Continual Improvement
The CSF identifies continual improvement as an essential category of the CSF that drives the
cyclical and event based improvement of cybersecurity maturity across the banking sector.
The continual improvement components require Regulated Entities to implement
cybersecurity baselines, execute continual assessments of the effectiveness and maturity of
their cybersecurity baselines, and prepare to respond to cyber-attacks.
The CSF defines the following components of continual improvement.
2.2.3.1 Cybersecurity Baselines
The CSF envisages the need to establish Cybersecurity Baselines (hereinafter referred to as
Baselines) as minimum requirements that Regulated Entities shall implement to improve their
overall cybersecurity posture. The Baselines have been designed with necessary and
appropriate consideration of CBK’s regulations, instructions and guidelines, prevalent
international cybersecurity standards and frameworks such as National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Information
Security Forum (ISF), Payment Card Industry (PCI), Center for Internet Security (CIS) and
CPMI-IOSCO PFMI.
The baselines are grouped into a hierarchical structure of domains, subdomains and controls.
The baselines will ensure consistent implementation and interpretation of controls across the
banking sector. CBK will monitor the implementation of these baselines and undertake
necessary initiatives to improve the sectoral maturity. The four domains of baselines are as
below:
a) Governance, Risk management, and Compliance:
Governance, Risk management and Compliance processes are essential for effective
management of cybersecurity risks. These processes shall assist Regulated Entities
to define, implement, monitor, oversee and assess the effectiveness of framework,
strategies, policies and controls.

Cybersecurity Framework for Kuwait Banking Sector

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 13 of 27

b) Technology and Operations:
Regulated Entities depend on technology to operate and deliver services to end
customers and internal users. To ensure the security and reliability of technology
assets, Regulated Entities shall implement appropriate security controls within their
technology assets.
c) Third Party Security:
Regulated Entities depend on multiple third-party vendors to operate or execute their
business functions. Innovation and efficiency are key drivers for such continued and
increasing reliance on third party vendors. Further, entities increasingly engage with
third party vendors for expertise, ease of operations, and access to new technologies
to improve the overall delivery of financial services to its customers. This domain
specifies controls to identify, mitigate and effectively monitor risks emanating from third
party service providers.
d) Protection of Electronic Payment Systems:
Global demand for faster and reliable electronic payments has resulted in rapid
development of innovative electronic payment systems. Electronic payment systems
are anticipated to evolve further with new technologies, innovative customer services
and improved products and solutions. This domain specifies controls to identify,
mitigate and effectively monitor risks related to payment systems.

The above domains are further classified into sub-domains pertaining to specific cybersecurity

The sub-domains contain the control considerations for effective management of
cybersecurity controls within that area and detailed in Cybersecurity Baselines. All controls
are uniquely numbered across the baselines for ease of reference.
Regulated Entities shall implement necessary mechanisms and processes to ensure
compliance with the baselines and address the gaps identified by undertaking appropriate
corrective actions.
This is essential to limit the impact of potential cyber-attacks that may disrupt business
operations, damage customer trust and an entity’s reputation, and/or result in regulatory
action.
The Regulated Entities shall adhere to the baselines at all times. The implementation of the
baselines shall assist in achieving an acceptable risk level for an entity and improve sectoral
maturity. CBK encourages the Regulated Entities to exceed these baselines in accordance
with their risk appetite. Regulated Entities may also refer on a case by case basis to CBK for
clarifications, and may suggest improvements or initiatives for consideration by CBK and the
ISWG.

2.2.3.2 Assessment & Maturity
The Assessment and Maturity component helps CBK to identify the existing levels of cyber
risk within the Regulated Entity and also across the sector and sets the required levels of
maturity of cybersecurity controls within the Regulated Entities. This component is a
repeatable and measurable process that leverages an assessment tool (template) that allows
CBK to measure and report on the cyber risk that exists within the Regulated Entities, and the
Regulated Entities’ compliance with the baselines. This component promotes Regulated
Entities’ compliance to baselines and continual improvement of cybersecurity maturity.
This component incorporates international best practice, frameworks and standards and is
aligned to the risk profile of the Regulated Entities. It contains three (3) key elements that the
Regulated Entities are required to complete:
1. Inherent Risk Profile: This identifies the inherent risk to the Regulated Entity’s
business operations prior to implementing controls, which informs minimum control
maturity requirements;
2. Baselines Assessment: Regulated Entities shall complete an assessment
against the baselines to assist in identifying the maturity of its cybersecurity
controls and hence residual risks within the Regulated Entities; and
3. Assessment Reporting: Regulated Entities shall provide CBK with their baseline
assessment results along with the remediation activities and plans where required.
In addition, the assessment template provides a rating scale for assessment of controls. The
rating scale is designed specifically for Kuwaiti Banking Sector and factors their varied
businesses, technical needs, inherent risks, and progressive implementation plans. The rating
scale for cybersecurity assessment and maturity is as below:

Cybersecurity Framework for Kuwait Banking Sector

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 17 of 27

The Cybersecurity assessment template and the guidebook document are designed to assist
consistent assessment and reporting.
Assessments, reports, and plans shall be subject to CBK’s periodic review and supervision.
CBK may suggest/ mandate necessary changes to inherent risk profiling, baseline
assessment, plans, exceptions and exclusions and may conduct necessary inspection.
While this component enhances the visibility of the risks and controls within the individual
Regulated Entities, when the assessment results are combined and aggregated appropriately,
it also improves the visibility of the maturity of cybersecurity across the sector. This enables
CBK to identify necessary initiatives or actions required to drive essential sectoral
improvements.
2.2.3.3 Cyber Crisis Management & Plan
The volatile nature of cyber threats can create significant service interruptions and quickly
spread across systems and virtual boundaries. This increases the risk for Regulated Entities
as they potentially become vulnerable to secondary exposure. CBK recognizes the need for
Regulated Entities to be alert and capable to appropriately identify and efficiently manage
crisis responses. This requires Regulated Entities to engage in leading practices, including:
●

Consistent preparation based on clear policy derived organizational structures and
roles;

●

Thorough response planning based on severity and impact;

●

A continuous learning posture, including exercising of response plans; and

●

Update plans and preparation based on lessons learned from real and simulated
responses.

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 18 of 27

The Cyber Crisis Management component is identified as a critical component to ensure
resilience of Kuwaiti Banking Sector by promoting effective, efficient, and consistent
responses to cybersecurity incidents and related crises. This component fulfils the objectives
of CSF by enhancing sector wide preparation, collaboration, compliance, and continuous
improvement to manage cyber crises. While Cyber Crisis Management necessitates
collaboration among Regulated Entities, it is classified under continual improvement due to
the cyclical nature.
The Cyber Crisis Management Strategy and Plan (CMSP) defines requirements which is
independent from business continuity management considerations, for the Regulated Entities’
crisis management preparation and response processes to promote the sector’s resilience
and capability to emerge stronger from Cyber incidents. The CMSP’s minimum requirements
for effective crisis management within regulated entities are also included within the CSF’s
baselines. The Regulated Entities must align their internal incident management and crisis
management programs accordingly.

Management, Baselines, Assessment and Maturity are elaborated in the following sections.

3.2.1 Cyber Crisis Management Cycle
The Cyber Crisis Management cycle includes the following key functions as a continual flow:
1. Prepare to prevent and mitigate crisis: The CSF’s baselines include minimum
controls required for the Regulated Entities to mitigate crisis, focused on:
●

Cybersecurity strategy;

●

Cyber crisis organizational structure, including at a minimum of crisis
management team, crisis response lead, and a Board approved severity impact
matrix;

●

Board approved planning for crisis management, disaster recovery, and
business continuity;

●

Regular exercising to improve familiarity and internalization;

●

Appropriate threat intelligence feeds that inform improvement opportunities;
and

●

Continuous learning model for crisis management preparation.

Page 21 of 27

2. Identify and invoke crisis management action plans: The CMSP specifies the
process of continuous monitoring and facilitates the timely invocation of sectoral
crisis based on a pre-defined severity impact matrix for such assessment. A crisis
response plan would then be invoked to ensure response and recovery measures.
3. Improve with lessons learned: The CSF and the CMSP drive continual learning,
which is based on lessons learnt during a crisis. The plans that were identified as
effective during a crisis or during a simulation of a crisis can be utilized by the
Regulated Entities and further improved.

3.2.2 Cybersecurity Baselines and Assessment-Maturity Cycle
The Baselines and Assessment & Maturity cycle includes the following key functions as a
continual flow:
1. Establish baselines: The baselines are identified collaboratively and must be
complied with by Regulated Entities. They ensure the existence of a minimum level
of maturity of cybersecurity controls in operation across the banking sector.
2. Inherent risk profiling: Regulated Entity’s level inherent risk profiling enables the
identification of appropriate control measures and associated assessment
procedure to be applied to the specific Regulated Entity. Entity level profiling results
are shared with CBK. CBK will issue appropriate guidance on applicable
assessment procedures based on the results, and aggregate the results to
visualize sectoral risk posture.
3. Assess control maturity: Entity level assessment of control maturity of Regulated
Entities enables the regulatory framework to verify the effectiveness of
implemented controls and understand the control maturity and residual risks of
each Regulated Entity.
4. Remedial actions on residual risks: Regulated Entities assess and commence
necessary actions to remediate the identified residual risks and improve
cybersecurity controls maturity. Such actions are time bound and the progress of
remediation is reported to CBK.

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 22 of 27

5. Visualize sectoral maturity: CBK will aggregate the results of entity level Inherent
risk profiling and cybersecurity controls assessments to analyze and understand
sectoral maturity and underline necessary actions to improve sectoral maturity.
6. Improve sectoral maturity goals: Subsequent to visualization of sectoral
cybersecurity controls maturity, CBK reviews the maturity levels and undertakes
the necessary actions to improve them by utilizing the various components defined
within this framework.
7. Update the baselines: CBK considers available observations from entity and
sectoral maturity reviews and undertakes the necessary amendments to the
baselines for adherence by the Regulated Entities in the subsequent iteration of
this cycle.
Assessment results, supporting documents and remediation plans are subject to CBK
review, supervision, and audit. CBK shall aggregate their observations based on such
assessment results and may direct the periodicity and methodology for subsequent
assessments and audits as a part of CBK’s supervision procedures.

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 3 of 55

1 Introduction
The State of Kuwait recognizes the importance of promoting the security of 'Critical National
Infrastructure' and has published the “National Cybersecurity Strategy for the State of Kuwait,
highlighting Kuwait’s banking sector as critical national infrastructure. Accordingly, the Central
Bank of Kuwait (CBK) identifies the need for the banking sector to improve its resilience to
cyber-attacks and is undertaking multiple initiatives under the ambit of Cybersecurity
Framework (CSF). The CSF aims to integrate cybersecurity and cyber resilience within the
governance and operations of Regulated Entities.
This document specifies the ‘Cybersecurity Baselines' (hereinafter referred to as 'Baselines')
that Regulated Entities shall implement to improve their overall cybersecurity posture. This
document forms a part of CBK’s initiative of Cybersecurity Framework for the Kuwaiti Banking
Sector.
The Baselines are developed to ensure existence of consistent cybersecurity controls within
Regulated Entities and improve the banking sector’s preparedness for cyber-attacks.
Regulated Entities are encouraged to implement enhanced controls beyond these baselines
depending on the risks identified within their environment and the entity's risk appetite.

1.1

Scope

The Cybersecurity Baselines are designed to provide the requirements to Cybersecurity
management system and cybersecurity standards including selection, implementation,
management and continual improvement of the cybersecurity controls in line with the entity
inherent risk profile and cyber risk exposure.
The scope of the Baselines includes cybersecurity related policies, procedures and controls
applicable to people, process and technology and covers:
a) hardware, software, network, and IT components;
b) electronic information / records;
c) physical installations such as data centers, information processing facilities and disaster
recovery sites;
d) people and associated processes; and

Cloud Service is new operational model and set of technologies enables ondemand access to a shared pool of resources such as applications, servers,
storage and network.
Cloud service delivery models:
• Infrastructure as a Service: The cloud service provider (CSP)
delivers IT infrastructure, such as space, computing power,
processing, networks, and other fundamental computing resources.
• Platform as a Service: The CSP provides a computing platform for
customers to develop and run their own applications.
• Software as a Service: The CSP makes software applications
available to customers.

Cloud service deployment models:
• Private Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned solely for a
single organization. A CSP typically owns and manages the
infrastructure of the private cloud, although the customer may also
own and manage the infrastructure. The infrastructure is located either
on customer premises or on the CSP’s premises.
Cloud Service
• Public Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by
the general public. A CSP owns and manages the infrastructure for
the public cloud, which is not located on the premises of the customer.
Although the data and services are protected from unauthorized
access, a variety of customers use and share the infrastructure.
• Community Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is shared by several
organizations and supports a specific community that has similar
computing needs or requirements, such as security, reliability, and
resiliency. The CSP or members of a community may own and
manage the infrastructure. The infrastructure is located either on
customer premises or the CSP’s premises. Hybrid Cloud: The hybrid
cloud is a combination of two or more of the private cloud, public cloud,
and community cloud (and can involve use of non-cloud
environments, as well). The CSP or the customer may own and
manage the hybrid cloud infrastructure, and in either case the
infrastructure may be located on- or off-premise, or both. The data and
services can be managed based on the design of the solution,

1. Introduction
The National Cyber Security Strategy for the State of Kuwait identified Kuwait’s banking sector
as part of the Critical National Infrastructure. In line with the National Cyber Security Strategy,
the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) recognizes the need for the banking sector to improve its
resilience to cyberattacks and actions. Accordingly, the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) has
been developed, and it is applicable to all Regulated Entities within the banking sector. To
meet the objectives of the CSF (illustrated in Figure 1), the Cyber Crisis Management Strategy
and Plan (the Strategy) is developed to standardize and improve the cyber crisis management
capabilities and response approaches for Regulated Entities across the Kuwaiti banking
sector, regardless of their size, nature, type and complexity. Accordingly, Regulated Entities
shall align their business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements with the Strategy.

1.1 Definition of Cyber Crisis
CBK defines “Cyber Crisis” for the Kuwaiti banking sector as:
“An adverse, unstable, and complex incident triggered by a cyber-attack / action both that
limits protection or restoration of systems’ availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality,
or nonrepudiation and that creates sufficient impact as to represent a threat to the strategic
objectives, reputation, or economic viability of Kuwait’s banking sector.”

2. Cyber Crisis Management Requirements
Regulated Entities are required to implement the following governance and organizational
structures to maintain a compliant, cyber crisis management preparedness and response
capabilities, which will assist them to respond to cyber incidents with crisis level impact
throughout the crisis lifecycle: react; respond; and emerge stronger (i.e. recover). CBK will
supervise Regulated Entities for compliance with these requirements during its inspection
cycle (e.g. crisis management and response plans existence and use, results of exercises
conducted, accountability of lessons learned, etc.).

2.1 Cybersecurity Strategy
Regulated Entities are required to establish cybersecurity strategies that are approved by
Board or Senior Management and that are tailored to their organizational structure, risk profile,
business objectives, and the strategic drivers (specified in Section 1.3). Regulated Entities’
cybersecurity strategies shall align with the Cybersecurity Baselines for the Kuwait Banking
Sector, organizational policies, and applicable national and international legal and regulatory
requirements.

2.2 Cyber Crisis Organization Structure
Regulated Entities are required to establish a cyber crisis organizational structure1 that defines
and integrates technical, business and management functions. The structure shall include a
Crisis Response Lead and Crisis Management Team proportional to the size, nature, type and
complexity of the Regulated Entity.

2.2.1 Crisis Management Team
Regulated Entities are required to establish Crisis Management Team led by the Crisis
Response Lead (specified in Section 2.2.2) and comprised of empowered, multi-functional
representatives, specifically including Operations, Information Technology, Information
Security, Legal, Communications, and other, relevant stakeholders. The team is responsible
for:
a. developing, maintaining, promoting, and exercising crisis management planning;

For some Regulated Entities, a singular team structure could deliver crisis as well as broader business continuity and other risk
management support. For other, larger Regulated Entities with more diverse operations, dividing the remit between a more strategic /
executive crisis management team and a more tactical / business continuity management team would pr omote having the appropriate
participants with the needed authorities at different levels of focus and action. Final designs shall be tailored to each Regulated Entity.

1

Cyber Crisis Management Strategy & Plan

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 7 of 28

b. assisting the Crisis Response Lead to assess whether an incident with crisis level
impact exists and whether a formal response is required;
c. mobilizing and deploying necessary internal and external resources to deliver the
response;
d. overseeing execution of response activities; and,
e. managing the communication with internal and external stakeholders throughout a
crisis management lifecycle.

2.2.2 Crisis Response Lead
Regulated Entities are required to identify Crisis Response Lead, who is authorized to make
crisis response related decisions independently and on behalf of the Regulated Entities. A
Crisis Response Lead has the sole authority within a Regulated Entity to declare that a crisis
exists and that a formal response is required. The Crisis Response Lead acts as a single
point of contact and as the lead representative of the Regulated Entity in CBK-led, sectorwide responses (specified in Section 3.3.1). Regulated Entities are required to ensure Crisis
Response Lead:
a. have sufficient skills and experience to comprehensively understand the Regulated
Entity’s operations and to make reasonable decisions guided by his/her own integrity,
competence, and professional capability;
b. have successfully completed relevant training (e.g. has relevant qualifications) and
continue to learn emerging cyber crisis related trends; and
c. have a documented set of authorities and responsibilities, including approval to make
decisions independently in support of the crisis response on behalf of the Regulated
Entity.

2.3 Severity Impact Matrix
Regulated Entities are required to develop a severity impact matrix that is approved by their
Board or Executive Management and that tiers impacts to the Regulated Entities (e.g. low,
medium, high) across their categories of significant consideration. The impact tiers dictate
appropriate mitigating actions in response to cyber incidents. Impact categories shall include
the categories captured within the Sector Severity Impact Matrix (specified in Section 3.2) as
well as Regulated Entity-specific impact categories and measurements (e.g. impacts from

Cyber Crisis Management Strategy & Plan

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 8 of 28

critical economic functions’2 operational risk tolerances being exceeded because of a
cybersecurity incident, etc.)3 The tiers of the severity impact matrix will consider the outcomes
of formal business impact analyses (BIA), internal assessments, and risk analyses.

2.4 Crisis Management Plans
Regulated Entities are required to maintain updated crisis management plans that support
their enterprise resilience beyond cyber crisis management planning. These Board- or
Executive Management-approved plans should address operational risk management
considerations

(e.g.

disaster

recovery,

business

continuity,

and

internal/external

communications policies, plans, procedures, and templates). The crisis management plans
shall be implemented enterprise-wide and shall structure key organizational functions,
authorities, and responsibilities and shall be aligned with legal, regulatory, and organizational
requirements.

2.5 Threat Intelligence, Notification, and Response Tracking
Regulated Entities are required to maintain and to use appropriate tools and threat intelligence
feeds from internal systems and third party providers. This approach will help Regulated
Entities to initiate enterprise-wide risk assessments and response efforts including:

2.5.1 Threat Intelligence Feeds
Threat intelligence and situational awareness feeds will support identification of relevant cyber
threats and actors that will assist in protecting information and information assets, as further
described in Cyber Threat Information Sharing Strategy4.

2.5.2 Emergency Notification
Appropriate incident detection measures (e.g., IT system monitoring, logs analysis
technologies) will support timely awareness of threats, and emergency notification
mechanisms will support timely contact with responders and employees in the event of an
incident with crisis level impact.
2 A critical economic function delivers the output from a Regulated Entity, without which there would be a material impact on the
Regulated Entity or its operations and by extension could represent a material impact on the Kuwaiti banking sector.
3 CBK recognizes that the tiered, impact details within Regulated Entities’ severity impact matrices will differ, based on their service
offerings, geographic spread of operations, volume and type of customer, etc. As such, CBK cannot mandate a common set of categories
and tier thresholds therein for every Regulated Entity in the sector. To promote some consistency across Regulated Entities, CBK
encourages Regulated Entities to interpret the Strategy’s Sector Severity Impact Matrix categories (specified in Section 3.2) on the scale of
their own operations.

2.5.3 Response Tracking Tools
Crisis management response tools (e.g. a decision and action logging capability) create an
auditable trail of response considerations, which assists lessons learned efforts.

2.6 Continuous Learning Model
Regulated Entities are required to adopt a continuous learning model to promote improved
and future readiness for cyber incidents, including providing targeted training and conducting
cyber crisis exercises. This approach enhances responders’ capability and confidence with
cyber incidents handling.

2.6.1 Training
Regulated Entities are required to provide regular training appropriate to crisis responders’
roles in crisis response as well as ad hoc training if there is any change to the Regulated
Entity’s response process.

2.6.2 Cyber Crisis Exercises
Regulated Entities are required to conduct cyber crisis exercises on an annual basis to ensure
that cyber crisis management plans, procedures, and response infrastructure remain relevant
and effective. The Regulated Entities are required to increase the complexity and intensity of
exercise scenarios as its crisis management maturity advances.

2.7 Third Party Requirements
Regulated Entities are required to include appropriate, crisis-relevant, contractual terms and
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with third party providers to promote the mitigation of the
risk introduced to Regulated Entities by third party providers. Regulated Entities are required
to obtain sufficient assurance from third party providers to mitigate cybersecurity risks.5

2.8 Sector Engagement and Crisis Exercises
Regulated Entities are required to participate in CBK-organized sector-wide crisis exercises
(illustrated in Figure 2) focused on cyber and other relevant scenarios. The exercises may be
in the form of workshops, tabletop exercises, cyber drills, etc. CBK will use Information
5 Regulated Entities shall be responsible for mitigating the risk introduced to their operations by those third parties on which the
Regulated Entities significantly depend to deliver their services – regardless of whether or not CBK directly regulates the third party. The
Regulated Entities shall have sufficient clarity and assurance of such third parties’ controls to mitigate cybersecurity incidents and crises.

3. Sector Wide Cyber Crisis Management Strategy
The Strategy defines Regulated Entities’ cyber crisis management requirements, including
processes for crisis responses across the banking sector to promote resilience and the ability
to emerge stronger from these incidents. The Strategy includes reporting requirements, a
sector severity impact matrix, and a sector wide response process.

3.1 Reporting Requirements of Regulated Entities
Continuous coordination between Regulated Entities and CBK before, during, and after a crisis
maximizes the opportunities to deliver effective, efficient, and consistent crisis responses.
Regulated Entities are required to execute a formal reporting process to CBK if an incident is
detected (specified in Section 4) that has or could have a significant and adverse effect on the
Regulated Entity’s ability to provide adequate services to its customers, on its reputation, or
on its financial condition. To measure the impact, Regulated Entities shall have an internal
severity impact matrix to guide appropriate and consistent assessments of the actual and
potential impacts of cybersecurity incidents on their organizations (specified in Section 2.3).
Regulated Entities are required to notify CBK of cybersecurity incidents, as stated below.

3.1.1 Low Severity Impact
Based on known and forecasted impacts, Regulated Entities are required to report to CBK on
a quarterly basis for all low severity impact rated, cyber incidents for analysis of threat
trends to the Kuwaiti banking sector (specified in Section 4.4). CBK may request additional
information as deemed necessary to promote its technical assessment of the situation.
Referential examples of relevant impacts for a low severity impact rated incident include but
are not limited to:
a. any cybersecurity issue that had minor impact on or the potential to disrupt the
Regulated Entity’s operations and ability to provide services to its customer population
if defensive or responsive actions had not mitigated the threat; or,
b. any cybersecurity issue assessed to have less than 2% of capital OR less than 10
million KD of collective financial impact on the Regulated Entity and/or its customers
(whichever is lower).

Cyber Crisis Management Strategy & Plan

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 12 of 28

3.1.2 Medium Severity Impact
Based on known and forecasted impacts, Regulated Entities are required to notify CBK
(specified in Section 4) regarding medium severity impact rated, cyber incidents for
response planning coordination within eight hours (business day hours) of discovery,
having completed initial quantification of potential and/or actual impact to the Regulated Entity
and/or its customers. CBK may request additional information as deemed necessary to
promote its technical assessment of the situation.
After the initial notification and assuming that the severity impact rating did not increase since
the last reporting, Regulated Entities shall provide CBK updates on response efforts using the
Situation Report (specified in Section 4.2) every two business days from the prior notification
(or at a cycle defined by CBK). Regulated Entities shall submit Closure Reports (specified in
Section 4.3) as soon as the response and recovery are completed.
Referential examples of relevant impacts for a medium severity impact rated incident
include but are not limited to:
a. any cybersecurity issue that partially or fully disrupts the Regulated Entity’s operations
and ability to provide services to 5-15% of its customer population;
b. any cybersecurity issue assessed to have between 2-5% of capital OR between 10-20
million KD of collective financial impact on the Regulated Entity and/or its customers
(whichever is lower);
c. any cybersecurity issue assessed to possibly result in a regulatory investigation of
and/or sanctions (Kuwaiti or offshore) against the Regulated Entity; or,
d. any cybersecurity issue assessed to possibly have a significantly negative impact on
the reputation of the Regulated Entity and/or the Kuwaiti banking sector.

3.1.3 High Severity Impact
Based on known and forecasted impacts, Regulated Entities are required to notify CBK
(specified in Section 4) regarding high severity impact rated, cyber incidents for response
planning coordination within four hours (business day hours or not) of discovery, having
completed initial quantification of potential and/or actual impact to the Regulated Entity and/or
its customers. CBK may request additional information as deemed necessary to promote its
technical assessment of the situation.
After the initial notification, the affected Regulated Entity shall provide updates on the
response to CBK through the ISWG and/or by using the Situation Report (specified in Section
Cyber Crisis Management Strategy & Plan

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 13 of 28

4.2) once a day (or at a cycle defined by CBK following the prior notification). Regulated
Entities shall submit Closure Reports (specified in Section 4.3) as soon as the response and
recovery are completed.
Referential examples of relevant impacts for a high severity impact rated incident include
but are not limited to:
a. any cybersecurity issue completely disrupting the Regulated Entity’s operations and
ability to provide services to more than 15% of its customer population;
b. any cybersecurity issue assessed to have more than 5% of capital OR 20 million KD
of collective financial impact on the Regulated Entity and/or its customers (whichever
is lower);
c. any cybersecurity issue likely to result in a regulatory investigation of and/or sanctions
(Kuwaiti or offshore) against the Regulated Entity; or,
d. any cybersecurity issue assessed to have a significantly negative impact on the
reputation of the Regulated Entity and/or the Kuwaiti banking sector.

Table 1: Summary of notification requirements for Regulated Entities to CBK, as applicable to
incidents of low, medium, and high impact ratings based on known and forecasted impacts.

3.2 Sector Severity Impact Matrix
Possible crisis triggers and their impacts on the sector are diverse, so the need for clear criteria
for invoking sector wide crisis response is imperative to promote predictable actions. As such,
CBK will use the Sector Severity Impact Matrix to assess critical categories of impact on the
sector as a whole to guide consistent decisions regarding responses’ structure and resource
allocation.
Timely and consistent notification by the Regulated Entities of both known and forecasted
impact details will promote CBK’s efficiency in determining whether multiple Regulated Entities
Cyber Crisis Management Strategy & Plan

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 14 of 28

might be the subject of a similar cybersecurity incident and by extension whether a centrally
coordinated, sector-wide crisis response might best achieve the strategic drivers. Incident
examples by tier include:
a. Low severity impact rated incident: Two Regulated Entities report that a cyber actor
virtually defaced their websites in such a way that interrupts the ability of many
customers – possibly as many as 25,000 – to access online banking services.
b. Medium severity impact rated incident: One Regulated Entity reports a cyber breach
resulting in the exposure of approximately 10,000 Personally Identifiable Information
(PII) records.
c. High severity impact rated incident: Three Regulated Entities report their inability to
provide services given a ransomware attack encrypting all of their data and their receipt
of ransom demands from the attackers to be paid to decrypt the data.
CBK will consolidate all crisis notifications reported by Regulated Entities and will assess them
against the Sector Severity Impact Matrix. CBK will respond based on the severity tier
identified by analyzing the reported impacts on Regulated Entities for each category, including
both known as well as forecasted trends. Meeting only one category’s impact description will
be sufficient to trigger a response structure for that level. This means that, if CBK combined
all Regulated Entities’ reported impacts and found that two categories had “low” severity
impacts and one category had a “medium” severity impact, then then CBK would intervene
and would leverage “medium” severity response protocols.
If available data does not support a clear determination that an impact category’s impact
description was met fully, CBK will presume a higher level of impact and react accordingly as
a default response methodology. CBK may raise or lower response protocols based on new
data.

3.3 Sector Wide Response
There may be a need for a unified, sector wide response to enable the Kuwaiti banking sector
to outperform some, high impact cyber threats. Regulated Entities’ full participation across the
following actions will maximize the skills, knowledge, and understanding that the banking
sector has to leverage in its cybersecurity efforts and crisis responses.

3.3.1 Structure of Response
In all low, medium, and high impact rated incidents, impacted Regulated Entities are
responsible for appropriately initiating their own incident response plans at the
Regulated Entities’ discretion to respond and mitigate the impact of the incident. Upon
receipt of Regulated Entities’ notifications (e.g., for medium and high impact rated
crises), CBK will assess the impact category and assist based on the below:
a. Low severity impact to the sector: If CBK assesses the reported, known, and
forecasted details have a “low” severity impact on the sector as a whole, then the
reporting Regulated Entities will operate independently to mitigate and to recover from
the crisis. While CBK will not plan to take any immediate action, CBK might escalate
the responses from the individual Regulated Entities to the ISWG for broader
coordination. CBK will coordinate internally to ensure appropriate awareness across
CBK’s leadership.
b. Medium severity impact to the sector: If CBK assesses the reported, known, and
forecasted details have a “medium” severity impact on the sector as a whole, CBK will
direct the reporting Regulated Entities to deliver their responses to mitigate and to
recover from the incident. CBK might escalate the responses from the individual
Regulated Entities to the ISWG for broader coordination. CBK will coordinate internally
and with Regulated Entities to support crisis responses. CBK’s coordination may
include engaging national coordination bodies and/or the executive leadership of the
relevant Regulated Entities.
c. High severity impact to the sector: If CBK assesses the reported, known, and
forecasted details have a “high” severity impact on the sector as a whole, CBK will
instruct the reporting Regulated Entities and the sector to deliver the unified response
to mitigate and to recover from the incident. CBK will activate the ISWG for sector
coordination

considerations. Regulated Entities’ ISWG Representatives as well as their Crisis
Response Leads will report to the ISWG upon CBK’s direction to support cross-sector
collaboration. CBK’s representative at the ISWG will coordinate internally to ensure
appropriate awareness across CBK’s leadership and will be empowered to make
decisions on behalf of CBK and the sector, so as to promote an efficient and effective
sector response. CBK’s coordination will include engaging national coordination
bodies and the executive leadership of the relevant Regulated Entities. CBK might
request the affected Regulated Entity to suspend services until the crisis is mitigated.

3.3.2 Response Cycle
CBK will instruct the Regulated Entities on the need and frequency for Regulated Entityspecific alignment meetings and/or ISWG-based alignment meetings. For example, “high”
impact rated, sector crises are likely to have daily meetings at the ISWG to coordinate the
response effort (e.g., a meeting at 1400) to update on actions during the day. The below
Figure 3 illustrates the overall cyber crises management response cycle.

3.3.3 Continual Improvement
Regulated Entities are required to work with CBK on a regular basis to foster continual
improvement of their cyber crisis management preparedness. This approach will gradually
improve the cyber crisis management maturity of the entire banking sector, as well. Regulated
Entities are required to implement relevant training and exercising programs and to submit
Closure Reports (specified in Section 4.3) to CBK to highlight areas of improvement. As part
of the continual improvement process, CBK will review Regulated Entities’ areas of
improvement and their lessons learned and will undertake changes to the Strategy to improve
the banking sector’s cyber capabilities, preparedness, and maturity.

1 Introduction
This document outlines the methodology for ‘Ongoing Assessment and Maturity Improvement’ to
the overall Cybersecurity Program of CBK, and provide guidance on how to use the ‘Cybersecurity
Readiness Assessment Template’ by regulated entities.

1.1

Target Audience

This document is expected to be read by individual assessors who will be responsible for updating
the information required in the Template. In addition, senior management, information security,
information technology, risk & compliance professionals and any other personnel of regulated
entities who are responsible for providing inputs for the assessment are expected to be abreast
with this document.

1.2

Approach Overview

Regulated Entities shall follow a structured self-assessment approach, which will assist in
identifying the current Maturity level of the organization. The steps for performing the selfassessment include:
a) Inherent Risk Profile: Regulated Entities shall identify the inherent risk based on set of
parameters that have been outlined in the Template. The intent of the inherent risk profile
is twofold; one is to provide the Regulated Entity with a consistent method to assess their
own inherent risk profile, second is for CBK to consistently measure the inherent risk of all
the entities under its supervision.
b) Baseline Assessment: Regulated Entities shall complete a baseline self-assessment in
order to assess maturity of their cybersecurity program. Appropriate business justifications
for exclusion shall be documented as part of the assessment.
c) Reporting: Regulated Entities shall provide CBK with their inherent risk profiling and
baseline assessment results and the remediation activities and plans as per the periodicity
defined by CBK.
d) Periodic / ad-hoc assessment and reporting: Regulated Entities shall provide
information as per the periodicity that will be defined by CBK. In addition, ad-hoc
information as stipulated by CBK from time to time will have to be provided by the
Regulated Entities.

2 Ongoing Assessment and Maturity Improvement Program
The below figure depicts the operational view of the Cyber Resilience Roadmap that has been
developed by CBK. In this document, we have covered the specific operational aspects of the
Assessment and Maturity component from the program.

The assessment and maturity improvement program will involve the following steps. The
assessments will be conducted using a excel based template which will be published by CBK. The
template serves as a method for consistent data sharing by the Regulated Entities.

2.1

Step 1: Inherent risk profiling

The Regulated Entities are expected to conduct a self-assessment of their inherent risk profile
using the template before conducting the baseline maturity assessment. The Inherent Risk Profile
assists by assessing the risk profile of the entity.

2.2

Step 2: Assess baseline maturity

The Regulated Entities are required to use the Baseline-Self Assessment template and conduct a
self-assessment to assess the baseline maturity of implemented controls. This would provide the
Regulated Entities with an accurate view of their preparedness and compliance with respect to the
cybersecurity risks. The results of the baseline maturity assessment would assist the Regulated
Entities to undertake initiatives to fulfill the identified gaps and improve their cyber resilience.

2.3

Step 3: Remedial actions

The completion of baseline assessment provides a set of controls on which the Regulated Entity
needs to undertake improvements/ initiatives and ensure compliance. Regulated entities are
required to undertake the necessary improvements as such gaps need to be remediated. A plan
for remediation is required to track and complete all remedial actions.
The consolidated results obtained after performing step 1 to 3 would need to be submitted to CBK
at pre-defined intervals.

2.4

Step 4: Assess sectoral maturity

CBK would collate individual outcomes provided by each Regulated Entity and arrive at the overall
sectoral and sub sectoral maturity.
The inherent-risk profiling will assist CBK in stratifying the Entities into groups and prescribe
specific reporting, compliance and baseline controls. The baseline maturity assessment results will
assist CBK in evaluating compliance, and overall status of sectoral Cybersecurity risks.

Version 1.0 – Jan 2020
Page 5 of 13

2.5

Step 5: Improve maturity goals

CBK shall periodically or at its discretion undertake independent review of the inherent risk profile
and baseline maturity assessment data shared by the Regulated Entities. Upon finding any gap as
part of this activity, CBK shall instruct the Regulated Entities to further undertake initiatives to
improve their security posture.
The above paragraph shall trigger steps 1 to 3 to be followed by the Regulated Entities and the
required submissions to be made to CBK.

2.6

Step 6: Improve and update baselines

Based on the overall trends in the sector, CBK will undertake further initiatives with a view to
improve the overall maturity and to address changes happening around the world in cybersecurity
risks and incorporate necessary changes in the Inherent Risk Profile and Baselines. CBK will
perform trend analysis based on the data collated from various regulated entities over a period of
time. In addition, cyber fraud related data from the banking sector will also be considered while
doing the trend analysis.
Every significant update will trigger an update of the inherent risk profile as well as the minimum
baselines prescribed for the Kuwait banking sector.
The steps 1-3, 4, 5 and 6 are non-linear and maybe invoked on an ad-hoc basis due to changes
in the business environment or any other factor significantly.

3 About the Template
This section is a user manual to guide the Regulated Entities on how to use the ‘Cybersecurity
Readiness Assessment Template’ (hereafter referred as the Template) and also assists in
updating the required information in the Template.
The ‘Template’ is designed to capture data from the Regulated Entities in a consistent manner so
that a baseline maturity score for individual regulated entities can be derived consistently.
The Template has the following tabs / modules (more commonly referred as tab in the document):
•

Document Control / Instructions;

•

Rating Guide;

•

Inherent-Risk Profile;

•

Baseline-Self Assessment;

•

Baseline Risk Map; and

•

Domain and Subdomain wise Maturity View.

This section describes the objective for each tab and also further details out the tables and fields,
within each table for complete understanding purpose. In order to minimize data update errors, all
fields except user editable fields are locked in the template. In this guide, fields which are user
editable have been marked in bold and italics in each table explained below.
