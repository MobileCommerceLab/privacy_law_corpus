PRELIMINARY

1.1

Title - Guideline on licensing of new institutions.

1.2

Authorization – This Guideline is issued under Section 33(4) of the Banking Act,
which empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue guidelines to be adhered to
by institutions in order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial
system.

1.3

Application - This Guideline applies to all applicants intending to be licensed to
conduct banking, mortgage or financial business in Kenya.

1.4

Definitions
1.4.1
Shell bank- A company which exists only on paper with no physical
presence and does not apparently trade or operate.
1.4.2
Significant shareholder- A person, other than the Government or a
public entity, who holds, directly or indirectly or otherwise has a
beneficial interest in more than five per cent of the share capital of an
institution or if it is proposed that such a person shall so hold or have
such a beneficial interest. Other terms used in this guideline are as
defined in the Banking Act.

PART II STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1

Purpose - The purpose of this Guideline is to provide information and guidance
to applicants seeking to secure a license to conduct the business of a bank,
financial institution or mortgage finance company in Kenya in compliance with
Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Banking Act.

2.2

Scope - This Guideline provides clear guidance on the conditions applicants must
fulfill to be eligible to be granted a license to conduct banking, financial or
mortgage business in Kenya. This Guideline does not address the authorization
procedures for Representative Offices in Kenya, which are provided for in the
Prudential Guideline on Representative Offices in Kenya (CBK/PG/17)

2.3

Responsibility – It is the responsibility of applicants and the promoters
proposing to conduct the business of an institution in Kenya to ensure
compliance with this Guideline.

PART III APPLICATION PROCEDURES
3.1

Preliminary Consultations
All prospective applicants seeking a license to conduct the business of an
institution are encouraged to contact the Central Bank of Kenya at an early stage
for an initial meeting to discuss their plans prior to submission of a formal
application. The purpose of the meeting would be to advise the applicants on
CBK requirements for licensing and clarify any other pertinent issues that the
applicant may raise.

3.2

Approval of Proposed Name
Every applicant seeking to conduct the business of an institution will be required
to submit the proposed name of the institution to the Central Bank of Kenya for
consideration and approval.

3.3

Incorporation
Once the name intended for use has been approved by the Central Bank of
Kenya, the promoters will ascertain with the Registrar of Companies that the
name selected is available for the Applicant’s use. After confirmation by the
Registrar of Companies, the promoters may proceed to incorporate the company
as by law required.

3.4

Unincorporated Branches of Foreign Institutions
Where the applicants intend to operate an unincorporated branch in Kenya rather
than a subsidiary, the applicants may proceed to submit their application to the
Central Bank once the name intended for use has been approved by the Central
Bank. Except for the mode of incorporation, all licensing requirements for
branches and subsidiaries are the same. The incorporation documents required
for a branch are those of the parent.

3. 5

Forwarding of Application
Upon incorporation, all applicants seeking a license to conduct banking business
are required to forward an application to the Central Bank which should include:

PART II: STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1 Purpose
This Guideline is intended to provide the minimum standards required from shareholders,
directors, chief executive officers, management and employees of an institution so as to
promote proper standards of conduct and sound banking practices, as well as ensure that
they exercise their duties and responsibilities with clarity, assurance and effectiveness. The
broad principles, standards and requirements under this Guideline are aligned with
international best practices on corporate governance.
This Guideline should not restrict or replace the proper judgment of the management and
employees in conducting day-to-day business. Each institution is therefore required to
formulate its own special policies (taking into account the institution’s special needs and
circumstances) on the duties, responsibilities and conduct of its directors, chief executive
officers and management.
2.2 Scope
This Guideline applies to the duties, responsibilities and code of conduct for shareholders,
directors, chief executive officers, management and employees of an institution.
2.3 Responsibility
The Board of Directors of each institution shall be responsible for formulating policies,
procedures and guidelines, which ensure that:
a) All directors, chief executive officers and management are made fully aware of their
duties, responsibilities and code of conduct;
b) all management decisions are made in accordance with prudent banking practices. The
shareholders of each institution shall be responsible for the appointment of a competent
and dedicated board of directors.
37

PART III: SOUND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES
3.1

Principle 1- Ethical Leadership and Integrity
The board should provide effective leadership based on an ethical foundation. Good
corporate governance is essentially about effective, responsible leadership characterized
by the ethical values of responsibility, accountability, fairness and transparency.

Specific Requirements
3.1.1 The board is responsible for ensuring that management actively cultivates a culture of
ethical conduct and sets the values to which the institution will adhere. The board
should align its conduct and the conduct of management with the values that drive the
institution‘s business and ensure these values are incorporated in a code of conduct and
adhered to in all aspects of its business.
3.1.2

The board should ensure that integrity permeates all aspects of the institution and its
operations and that the institution‘s vision, mission and strategic objectives are ethically
sound. The manner in which the institution conducts its internal and external affairs
should be beyond reproach.

3.1.3 The board is responsible for considering the legitimate interests and expectations of the
institution’s stakeholders in its deliberations, decisions and actions. The following four
ethical values underpin good corporate governance:
a) Responsibility: The board should assume responsibility for the assets and actions of
the institution and be willing to take corrective actions to keep the institution on a
strategic path that is ethical and sustainable.
b) Accountability: The board should be able to justify its decisions and actions to
shareholders and other stakeholders.
c) Fairness: The board should ensure that it gives fair consideration to the legitimate
interests and expectations of all stakeholders of the institution.
d) Transparency: The board should disclose information in a manner that enables
stakeholders to make an informed analysis of the institution‘s performance, and
sustainability.
3.1.4 As a steward of the institution, each director should also discharge the following key
moral duties:
a) Conscience: A director should act with intellectual honesty and independence of
mind in the best interests of the institution and all its stakeholders, in accordance
with the inclusive stakeholder approach to corporate governance. Conflicts of
interest should be avoided.

38

b) Inclusivity of stakeholders is essential to achieving sustainability and the legitimate
interests and expectations of stakeholders must be taken into account in decisionmaking and strategy.
c) Competence: A director should have the knowledge and skills required for
governing an institution effectively. This competence should be continually
developed.
d) Commitment: A director should be diligent in performing his duties and devote
sufficient time to institution affairs. Ensuring institution performance and
compliance requires unwavering dedication and appropriate effort.
e) Courage: A director should have the courage to take the risks associated with
directing and controlling a successful, sustainable institution, and also the courage to
act with integrity in all board decisions and activities.
3.1.5 The board should ensure that the company‘s ethical standards (as stated in the code of
conduct and related policies) are integrated into all the institution‘s strategies and
operations. The code of conduct should be supplemented by several ethics-related
policies that provide detailed guidelines for dealing with specific issues which would
adversely impact or influence the market or dent the reputation of the institution such as
engaging in manipulative trading and unfair business practices.
3.2

Principle 2- Responsibilities of Shareholders
Shareholders of banking institutions shall jointly and severally protect, preserve and
actively exercise the supreme authority of the institution in general meetings. They have
a duty, jointly and severally, to exercise that supreme authority.

Specific Requirements
3.2.1 To the extent that the duty is vested in general meetings, the shareholders must ensure
that only credible persons who can add value to the institution’s banking business are
elected or appointed to the board of directors;
3.2.2 No shareholder with more than five percentage (5%) shareholding in a banking
institution shall be an executive director or form part of the management of the
institution or institution’s holding company.
3.2.3 Shareholders must ensure that, in general meetings and related forums, the board is
constantly held accountable and responsible for the efficient and effective governance of
the banking institution. In the event that the board of directors does not perform to
expectation or in accordance with the mandate of the institution, shareholders are
expected to take appropriate action to change the composition of the board.

39

3.2.4 Shareholders are expected to ensure that the institution applies to Central Bank of Kenya
for approval in the following circumstances, with respect to shareholding of financial
institutions:



Transfer of existing shareholding in excess of 5% of an institution’s share capital;
Acquisition of more than 5% of the share capital of an institution where there is
fresh capital injection, or from existing shareholders.

It is similarly the institutions responsibility to ensure that the above approvals relating to
significant shareholders are obtained from the Central Bank of Kenya, before allotment
of shares. The applications relating to significant shareholders should include forms
containing details of significant shareholders as specified in the form CBK/IF1-3
annexed to Guideline No. CBK/PG/01 on Licensing of New Institutions.
3.3

Principle 3 - Overall responsibilities of the Board
The board has overall responsibility for the bank, including approving and overseeing
the implementation of the bank’s strategic objectives, risk strategy, corporate
governance and corporate values. The board is also responsible for providing oversight
of senior management.
Specific Requirements

3.3.1

Board Charter
The Board of Directors (BOD) of every institution is required to formulate a Board
Charter that outlines, among others, the principal role of the BOD, the demarcation of
the roles, functions, responsibilities and powers of the Board, various Board
Committees and matters reserved for final decision-making or pre-approval by the
Board; and the policies and practices of the Board in respect of matters such as conflicts
of interest and convening of Board meetings. The charter should require all directors to
declare any interests that may give rise to a potential or perceived conflict including
multiple directorships, business relationships or other circumstances that could interfere
with exercise of objective judgment. It should define the policy on directorships in other
entities by board members and the terms/tenure limits for board members where
applicable.
The Charter should define the specific responsibilities of the BOD, in order to enhance
coordination and communication between the Chief Executive and the Board and more
specifically, to clarify both Board and Management accountability for the benefit of the
institution, its shareholders and other stakeholders. The roles of the Chairman of the

40

Board and the Chief Executive Officer should be clearly outlined and demarcated in the
charter.
3.3.2 Regulating the manner in which the business is conducted.
The board must provide clear objectives and policies within which senior executive
officers are to operate. These should cover all aspects of operations, including strategic
planning, credit administration and control, asset and liability management
encompassing the management of liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market risk,
accounting and internal control systems, service quality, automation plan, prevention of
money laundering, profit planning and budgeting, adequacy of capital, and human
resource development. Clear lines and limits of authority for all levels of staff should be
established. The seriousness of infringing on the authorized limits should be emphasized
to staff at all levels.
A vital part of the responsibilities of directors is to formulate the future direction of the
institution of which planning, organizing, and controlling, are three fundamental
functions. Sound planning is of vital importance, and as such projections/targets must be
periodically reviewed and amended as circumstances dictate.
3.3.3

Attend Board meetings regularly
Every director has a duty to attend board meetings regularly and to effectively
participate in the conduct of the business of the Board. Every member of the board shall
attend at least 75% of the board meetings of an institution in any financial year.
Attendance of board meetings may include physical appearance, video conferencing
(refer to Schedule Part VII: Guidance notes on video conferencing) or such other
method that the Central Bank may allow or prescribe upon application by an institution
on the method sought and the controls to be put in place to ensure adherence to the
recommendations of this guideline. This is to ensure every board member discharges his
or her duties and responsibilities effectively.

3.3.4

Be informed about business condition of the institution
Since the directors are jointly and severally responsible for the effective supervision of
the affairs of the institution, they should be informed on a regular basis of the business
condition of the institution. For the purpose of deliberating on this information and
providing guidance to the management, the Board should meet regularly, preferably at
least once in a quarter.
In addition, the Board and each director should exercise independent judgment in
evaluating the performance of the management. This could be enhanced by the provision
of independent reviews of the operations by third parties such as external auditors,
internal auditors, audit committees and other experts reporting directly to the Board.
41

3.3.5

Observe Laws and guidelines
The board should ensure cognizance is taken by management and themselves of all
applicable laws and guidelines, and systems to effectively monitor and control their
compliance. This will likely include provisions for training of personnel in these matters
and, when violations do occur, ensure compliance immediately. It is a duty inherent
with the office of directors (or management) to know the laws and guidelines, and to
ensure that compliance of all laws and guidelines receives the highest priority, and
violations are not knowingly committed by themselves or by anyone in their
employment. In particular, every director should be conversant with the provisions of
the Banking Act, Central Bank of Kenya Act and any guideline issued hereunder or
other relevant laws and guidelines. Directors should also review the institutions Central
Bank of Kenya’s inspection reports and audit reports and also ensure implementation of
any recommendations made.

3.3.6

Organizational Structure
The board should ensure that the bank’s organizational structure facilitates effective
decision making and good governance. This should include setting and enforcing lines
of responsibility and accountability throughout the organization, which define clearly the
key responsibilities and authorities of the board itself, as well as of senior management
and the control functions.

3.3.7

Oversight of senior management
It is the duty of the Board of Directors to define the duties of management and appoint
those persons who are competent, qualified and experienced to administer the
institution’s affairs effectively and soundly. It is also the responsibility of the Board to
dispense with the services of staff considered undesirable. In providing oversight of
senior management the board should:
a) Select and, where necessary, replace senior management and have in place an
appropriate plan for succession.
b) monitor that senior management’s actions are consistent with the strategy and
policies approved by the board, including the risk tolerance/appetite;
c) meet regularly with senior management;
d) question and review critically explanations and information provided by senior
management;
e) set formal performance standards for senior management consistent with the longterm objectives, strategy and financial soundness of the bank, and monitor senior
management’s performance against these standards.

42

3.3.8

Policies, Processes and Controls

The board should regularly review policies, processes and controls with senior
management and/or internal control functions (including internal audit, risk management
and compliance) in order to determine areas needing improvement, as well as to identify
and address significant risks and issues. The frequency of the review should be clearly
stated in the institution’s own policies. The board should ensure that the control
functions are properly positioned, staffed and resourced and are carrying out their
responsibilities independently and effectively.
3.3.9 Corporate values and code of conduct
The board should ensure that appropriate steps are taken to communicate throughout the
bank the corporate values, professional standards or codes of conduct it sets, together
with supporting policies and procedures. In doing so the board should ensure:
a) The institution’s code of conduct, or comparable document, articulates acceptable
and unacceptable behaviors. It is especially important that such a document
disallows behavior that could result in the bank engaging in any improper or illegal
activity, such as money laundering, fraud, bribery or corruption. It should also
discourage excessive risk taking activities.
b) The institution’s corporate values recognize the critical importance of timely and
frank discussion and elevation of problems to higher levels within the organization.
Communication should be allowed to be channeled to the board - directly or
indirectly (e.g. through an independent audit or compliance process or through an
ombudsman) - and independent of the internal ‚chain of command‛.
3.3.10 Maintain Positive Image
It is the duty of the directors to ensure that the institution maintains a positive image
within the industry and the economy as a whole. To this extent, therefore, the institution
is expected to provide adequate services and facilities both efficiently and competitively
in line with safe and sound banking practices.
In discharging their responsibilities, the board should take into account the legitimate
interests of shareholders, depositors and other relevant stakeholders. It should also
ensure that the bank maintains an effective relationship with its supervisors.
3.4

Principle 4 - Role and competence of Board members
Board members should be and remain qualified, including through training and
Continuous Professional Development (CPD), for their positions. They should have a
clear understanding of their role in corporate governance and be able to exercise sound
and objective judgment about the affairs of the bank.
43

Specific Requirements
3.4.1 No director shall take up his/her position prior to being cleared by the Central Bank.
The Institution shall submit to the Central Bank duly completed form CBK/IF 1-2
annexed to Guideline No. CBK/PG/01 on Licensing of New Institutions.
3.4.2 The board should possess, both as individual board members and collectively,
appropriate experience, competencies and personal qualities, including professionalism
and personal integrity.
3.4.3 To ensure objective judgment about the affairs of an institution, the following
individuals are not eligible to be appointed as directors:
a) Professionals (e.g. lawyers, accountants and valuers) involved in the provision of
professional services to the relevant institution;
b) Senior officers and non-executive directors of a government regulatory body where
there may be a conflict of interest.
3.4.4 The board collectively should have adequate knowledge and experience relevant to each
of the material financial activities the bank intends to pursue in order to enable effective
governance and oversight. Examples of areas where the board should seek to have, or
have access to, appropriate experience or expertise include finance, accounting,
strategic planning, communications, governance, risk management, bank regulation,
auditing and compliance.
3.4.5 In order to help board members acquire, maintain and deepen their knowledge and
skills and to fulfill their responsibilities, the board should ensure that board members
have access to programmes of tailored initial training (e.g. induction) and Continuous
Professional Development (CPD) on relevant issues. Directors who have acquired
professionally recognized CPD (locally or internationally) can be considered to have
met the CPD requirements. The board should dedicate sufficient time, budget and other
resources for this purpose. The Chief Executive Officer is required to report to the
Central Bank of Kenya on an annual basis the CPD programmes in which the board
members participated in together with the board members annual evaluations as required
under Part VI of this Prudential Guideline.
3.4.6 Board Composition
i.The Companies Act (Cap 486) of the Laws of Kenya provides for the appointment
of a minimum of two directors for every company incorporated under the Act.
However, due to the special nature of deposit-taking institutions which gives them an
added responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the depositors, the Central Bank of
Kenya requires all institutions licensed under the Banking Act, to have at least five
directors. To be effective, the board must have an appropriate number of directors that
44

are commensurate with the complexity, the size, the scope and operations of the
Institution.
ii.Every board should consider whether its size, diversity and demographics make it
effective. Diversity applies to academic qualifications, technical expertise, relevant
banking knowledge, experience, nationality, age and gender. Every institution is
required to submit an annual report to the Central Bank of Kenya highlighting the
initiatives taken to ensure that the board is properly constituted and is appropriately
diverse. The report should be submitted together with the board members annual
evaluations as required under Part VI of this Prudential Guideline.
iii.Foreign owned locally incorporated institutions are required to have local
representation in the board.
iv. The board should be composed of both Executive and Non-Executive Directors with
the Chief Executive being one of the board members. The non executive directors
should not be less than three-fifths of the directors in order to enhance accountability in
the decision”making process. Non-executive directors could mitigate any possible
conflict of interest between the policy-making process and the day-to-day management
of the Institution.
v.Further, independence and objectivity can be enhanced by including qualified
independent non-executive directors. Independent directors should provide the
necessary checks and balances on the board of the institution so as to ensure that the
interests of minority shareholders and general public are given due consideration in the
decision-making process. Qualified independent directors can also bring new
perspectives from other businesses that may improve the strategic direction given to
management, such as insight into local conditions, and can also be significant sources
of management expertise. It is therefore required that independent directors should
constitute not less than a third (1/3) of the total members of the board.
vi.In identifying potential board members, the board through the board Nominating
Committee should ensure that the candidates are qualified to serve as board members
and are able to commit the necessary time and effort to fulfill their responsibilities.
Serving as a board member or senior manager of a company that competes or does
business with the bank can compromise board independent judgment, as can crossmembership of boards.
vii.No person shall be permitted to hold the position of a director in more than two
institutions licensed under the Banking Act unless the said institutions are associates,
subsidiaries or holding companies. This rule shall not apply to government bodies
represented in institutions’ boards by virtue of their position as shareholders.
viii.Shareholders are ultimately responsible for the composition of the board and it is in
their own interests to ensure that the board is properly constituted from the viewpoint
of skill and diversity. Procedures for appointments to the board should be formal,
transparent and incorporate the following aspects;
(a) The reasons for the removal, resignation or retirement of directors.
45

(b) The composition of the board and board committees and the number of
meetings held, attendance at those meetings and the manner in which the board
and its committees have discharged its duties;
(c) The education, qualifications and experience of the directors;
(d) The length of service and age of the directors and;
(e) Any other relevant information.
ix.Occasionally, a person may act as an alternate to a director of an institution. The
‚alternate directors‛ have all the obligations imposed on the primary directors and
shall therefore be subject to the approval requirement as outlined in 3.4.1 above.
3.5

Principle 5 - Board’s Governance practices
The board should define appropriate governance practices for its own work and have in
place the means to ensure such practices are followed and periodically reviewed for
improvement.
Specific Requirements

3.5.1 Role of the chair
a) The chair of the board plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the board. He
or she provides leadership to the board and is responsible for the board’s effective
overall functioning. To achieve appropriate checks and balances, the chair of the
board must be a non-executive director.
b) The chair should ensure that board decisions are taken on a sound and well-informed
basis. He or she should encourage and promote critical discussion and ensure that
dissenting views can be expressed and discussed within the decision-making process.
c) The Chair should also ensure:
 the smooth functioning of the board, the governance structure and inculcating
positive culture in the board;
 guidelines and procedures are in place to govern the board’s operation and
conduct;
 all relevant issues are on the agenda for board meetings and all directors are able
to participate fully in the board’s activities;
 the board debates strategic and critical issues;
 the board receives the necessary information on a timely basis from the
management;
 avenues are provided for all directors to participate openly in the discussion; and
that he provides leadership to the board and is responsible for the developmental
needs of the board.
d) The institution should apprise CBK when the chair vacates office within 7 days after
his / her departure and the reasons for the exit should be disclosed.
46

3.5.2 Board committees
i) Specific requirements
a) To increase efficiency and allow deeper focus in specific areas, the board shall
establish specialized board committees; however, the board remains accountable. The
number and nature of committees depends on many factors, including the size of the
bank and its board, the nature of the business areas of the bank, and its risk profile.
However, the Board Audit Committee, Board Risk Management Committee and
Board Credit Committee are mandatory.
b) Each committee should have a charter or other instrument that sets out its mandate,
scope and working procedures. In the interest of greater transparency and
accountability, a board should disclose the committees it has established, their
mandates, and their composition (including members who are considered to be
independent). To avoid undue concentration of power and to promote fresh
perspectives, it may be useful to consider occasional rotation of membership and
chairmanship of such committees.
c) There should be a formal procedure for certain functions of the board to be delegated,
describing the extent of such delegation, to enable the board to properly discharge its
duties and responsibilities and to effectively execute its decision making process.
d) Board committees should be free to take independent professional advice as and when
necessary, and to invite Senior Management to provide technical advice when needed.
e) The board shall not delegate any matters to a board committee, chief executive officer,
executive directors or key management personnel, to an extent that such delegation
would significantly hinder or reduce the ability of the board as a whole to discharge
its functions.
ii) Board Audit Committee (BAC)
a. Objective
To provide independent oversight of the institution’s financial reporting and internal
control system, ensure checks and balances within the institution are in place and to
recommend appropriate remedial action regularly, preferably at least once in three
months.
b. Composition
To enhance independence and effectiveness of the Board Audit Committee, the
composition and structure of the BAC should meet the following requirements;
 The Audit Committee shall comprise only non-executive directors with at least
three members;
 The majority of the BAC members should be independent non-executive directors;
 The committee should be chaired by an independent director;
47





The Chairman of the board should neither be the chairperson nor a member of the
BAC but may be invited to attend meetings as necessary by the chairperson of the
committee;
At least one member should have accounting expertise or experience in the field of
finance and be a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya
(ICPAK) or an equivalent institute recognized by the East Africa Community
member states, or an equivalent international institute recognized by ICPAK.

The Audit Committee may invite the Chief Executive or any other member to attend the
meetings occasionally for consultation only. However, the committee should meet at least
twice in a year with the external and internal auditors without management being present.
These may be separate meetings or meetings held before or after a scheduled audit
committee meeting.
The BAC is required to hold regular meetings, at least once every quarter and should
report regularly to the full board. Alternate directors are not allowed to be appointed as
members of the Audit Committee.
The external and internal auditors of a banking institution should have free access to the
Audit Committee. The auditors should be allowed to attend and be heard at any meeting
of the Audit Committee. Upon the request of the auditors, the Chairman of the Audit
Committee should convene a meeting to consider any matter that auditors believe should
be brought to the attention of directors or shareholders.
c. Roles and Responsibilities
i.

ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

Ensure establishment of a permanent internal audit function. In fulfilling its duties
and responsibilities, the board and senior management should take all the
necessary measures to ensure that the institution has a permanent internal audit
function commensurate with its size, nature and complexity of its operations.
Ensure that senior management establishes and maintains an adequate, effective
and efficient internal control framework and internal audit function.
Have explicit authority to investigate any matter within its terms of reference, full
access to and co-operation by management.

ethical standards and requirements, including effectiveness of procedures for
handling and reporting complaints.
Review any related party transactions that may arise within the banking institution.
The audit committee should play a key role in ensuring that the company‘s internal
audit function is independent and has the necessary resources, budget, standing
and authority to enable it to discharge its functions effectively.
Regardless of whether internal audit activities are outsourced, the board of
directors remains ultimately responsible for ensuring that the system of internal
control and the internal audit function are adequate and operating effectively.
In a group structure, the board of directors and senior management of the parent
institution have the overall responsibility for ensuring that an adequate and
effective internal audit function is established across the group and for ensuring
that internal audit policies and mechanisms are appropriate to the structure,
business activities and risks of all of the components of the group.
The audit committee should be responsible for the performance assessment of the
Head of Internal Audit. Additionally, the committee should be consulted on the
appointment and dismissal of the internal auditor.
The audit committee should approve the internal audit plan, as well as oversee
staffing and objectives of the internal audit function.

49

iii) Board Credit Committee (BCC)
a. Objective
To assist the board of directors in reviewing and overseeing the overall lending of the
institution.
b. Composition
The board shall determine the composition of the BCC which should be guided by the
skill and experience of the directors. However, to enhance independence and objectivity
of the BCC, institutions are required to appoint an independent non-executive director as
the chairperson of the BCC. The chairman of the institution’s board should not chair the
Board Credit Committee but can be included as a member.
c. Roles and Responsibilities
a) Review and oversee the overall lending policy of the banking institution;
b) Deliberate and consider loan applications beyond the discretionary limits of the
Credit Risk Management Committee;
c) Review lending by the Credit Risk Management Committee;
d) Ensure that there are effective procedures and resources to identify and manage
irregular problem credits, minimize credit loss and maximize recoveries;
e) Direct, monitor, review and consider all issues that may materially impact on the
present and future quality of the institution’s credit risk management; and
f) Delegate and review lending limits to the sanctioning arms of the institution;
g) Assist the board with discharging its responsibility to review the quality of the
banking institution’s loan portfolio, and ensuring adequate provisions for bad and
doubtful debts in compliance with requirements of the prudential guidelines.
h) Conduct loan reviews independent of any person or committee responsible for
sanctioning credit; and
i) Ensure that the credit policy and risk lending limits are reviewed at least on an
annual basis and as and when the environment so dictates;
iv) Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC)
a. Objective
The responsibility to ensure quality, integrity and reliability of the institution’s risk
management shall be delegated to the BRMC. The Committee shall assist the board of
directors in the discharge of its duties relating to the corporate accountability and
associated risks in terms of management, assurance and reporting.
b. Composition
The Board Risk Management Committee shall comprise mainly non-executive directors
and should be chaired by an independent non-executive director.
50

c. Roles and Responsibilities
i. The committee shall review and assess the integrity of the risk control systems and
ensure that the risk policies and strategies are effectively managed.
ii. The committee shall set out the nature, role, responsibility and authority of the risk
management function with the banking institution and outline the scope of risk
management work.
iii. The committee shall monitor external developments relating to the practice of
corporate accountability and the reporting of specifically associated risk, including
emerging and prospective impact. The committee shall provide independent and
objective oversight and review of the information presented by management on
corporate accountability and specifically associated risk, also taking account of risk
concerns raised by management in the Audit Committee, Asset and Liability
Committee meetings on financial, business and strategic risk.
iv. The committee, in carrying out its task under these terms of reference, may obtain
such outside or other independent professional advice as it considers necessary to
carry out its duties. The Executive Committee will ensure that the committee will
have access to professional advice both inside and outside of the banking institution in
order for it to perform its duties.
v. The risk management function shall have access to any information it needs to fulfill
its responsibilities.
3.5.3 The Board and Director Evaluation
The Board through its nomination committee, similar board committee or an
independent service provider shall regularly review its required mix of skills and
experience and other qualities in order to assess the effectiveness of the board. Such
review shall be by means of peer and self-evaluation of the board as a whole, its
committees and the contribution of each and every director, including the Chairman.
Assistance from external facilitators in carrying out board assessments can contribute to
the objectivity of the process. Where the board has serious reservations about the
performance or integrity of a board member, the board should take appropriate actions.
The evaluations for the board, board committees and the individual directors shall be
conducted annually and the fact that it has been done should be disclosed in the annual
report. The Chief Executive Officer / Managing Director shall submit a report,
including the peer and self-evaluations to the Central Bank of Kenya annually on the
51

board and directors’ evaluations and effectiveness. Board and peer evaluation shall be
based on the guidance provided in the attached Board Evaluation Form CBK/PG/19/F1
and Individual Director Evaluation Form CBK/PG/19/F2 of this guideline respectively.
The report shall be submitted by 31st March of the following year.
3.5.4 Board and Committee evaluation






Effective and meaningful evaluation is only possible once the board has determined
its own role, functions, duties and performance criteria as well as those for directors
on the board and on board committees.
The board should carefully consider whether the evaluations of performance and
independence should be done in-house or conducted by independent service providers
or other criteria that may be prescribed by CBK. Evaluation procedures and results
should be reviewed by the nomination committee or such similar committee of the
board.
The Chairman, through the nominating committee, may lead the overall performance
evaluation of the board and board committees with the assistance of the Company
Secretary. However, independent performance appraisals should be considered in the
interest of eliciting candid responses. The board should discuss the board evaluation
results at least once a year.

3.5.5 Individual Director Evaluation









The same principles adopted in the evaluation of the board should be applied when
evaluating the board chairman and individual directors.
A director‘s contribution to the board should be measured against his / her duties.
The nomination for re-appointment of a director at the AGM should not be an
automatic process and should only occur after the proper evaluation of the
performance and attendance of the director in question.
Evaluations should be led by the Chairman through the nominating committee, or by
an independent service provider. The Chairman should ensure that directors know
that they will be subject to evaluation, and understand the criteria used for evaluation,
and the evaluation procedures that will be followed.
Should a deficiency in a director‘s performance be identified, a plan should be
developed and implemented for the director to acquire the necessary skills or to
develop appropriate behavioral patterns. The director evaluation should be
approached in an open, constructive and non-confrontational manner.
The board should appoint or elect an independent non-executive director from within
its ranks to lead the process of the evaluation of the Chairman‘s performance if an
independent service provider is not used.

52

3.5.6 Conflicts of Interest
i.

ii.

iii.

Persons empowered with decision-making authority (including directors) should
exercise care to avoid situations that may give rise to a conflict of interest situation.
The Code of Conduct as detailed under Part IV of this Guideline must strictly be
observed.
The board should establish procedures to address conflicts of interest and should
ensure that senior management implement policies to identify, prevent or
appropriately manage and disclose potential conflicts of interest situations that may
arise. Such policies should ensure that an institution’s activities that may give rise
to conflicts of interest are carried out with sufficient degree of independence from
each other. This could be done by, for example, ensuring appropriate segregation
of duties so that employees are not assigned potentially conflicting responsibilities,
providing for separate reporting lines and internal controls and establishing
information barriers between different activities.
The board should appoint or select one of the independent directors to chair the
board meetings which deal with the succession of the Chair Person, the Chair
Person‘s performance appraisal and when the Chair Person has conflict of interest.
Where board members have an interest in a matter, they should be excluded from
discussions on the said matter to ensure that the matter is objectively dealt with.

3.5.7 Controlling shareholders
Where there are controlling shareholders with power to appoint board members, the
board should exercise corresponding caution. In such cases, it is useful to bear in mind
that the board members have responsibilities to the shareholders and the bank. In cases
where there are board members appointed by a controlling shareholder, the board may
wish to set out specific procedures or conduct periodic reviews to ensure the appropriate
discharge of responsibilities by all board members.
3.5.8 Resignation / Removal of Directors
It will be the responsibility of the Board of Directors to report to the Central Bank of
Kenya, the resignation and/ or removal of any of its members (either executive or nonexecutive directors) within seven days of the date of resignation. The board should
disclose the reasons for the removal, resignation or retirement of directors.
3.5.9 Local Committees
Branches of foreign banks should have at least five members in their local committees
whose responsibilities shall be as those of the Board of Directors as specified in this

53

guideline. While it is acknowledged that the strategies and policies are driven by the head
office, in order to be consistent with its own strategies, the local board is expected to:
a. Discuss, evaluate and provide input on strategies and policies to suit local environment;
b. Deliberate and approve major issues and decisions affecting its operations.
c. Evaluate head office policies and ensure they are aligned to the Kenyan laws and
regulations.
3.6

Principle 6 - Corporate Governance in a Group structure
In a group structure, the board of the parent company has the overall responsibility for
adequate corporate governance across the group and ensuring that there are governance
policies and mechanisms appropriate to the structure, business and risks of the group and
its entities.
Specific Requirements

3.6.1

Subsidiary / Group Relationship
The board of a regulated banking subsidiary at the legal entity level should adhere to
the same corporate governance principles as those expected for its parent company in
the absence of other legal requirements or reasons of proportionality. However, the
group dimension is likely to affect to a certain extent the corporate governance
structure of both parent and subsidiaries, and therefore boards should pay attention to
how to apply the principles, including taking in consideration the following points;

3.6.2

Board of Parent Company
I.

In the discharge of its corporate governance responsibilities, the board of the parent
company should be aware of the material risks and issues that might affect both the
bank as a whole and its subsidiaries. It should therefore exercise adequate oversight
over subsidiaries, while respecting the independent legal and governance
responsibilities that might apply to regulated subsidiary boards.

II.

In order to fulfill its corporate governance responsibilities, the board of the parent
company should:
a) establish a governance structure which contributes to the effective oversight of
subsidiaries and which takes into account the nature, scale and complexity of the
different risks to which the group and its subsidiaries are exposed;
b) set and approve a corporate governance policy at the group level for its
subsidiaries, which includes the commitment to meet all applicable governance
requirements;

54

c) ensure that enough resources are available for each subsidiary to meet both
group standards and local governance standards; and
d) have appropriate means to monitor that each subsidiary complies with all
applicable governance requirements.
3.6.3

Board of Regulated Subsidiary
The board of a regulated banking subsidiary should retain and set its own corporate
governance responsibilities, and should evaluate any group-level decisions or practices
to ensure that they do not put the regulated subsidiary in breach of applicable legal or
regulatory provisions or prudential rules. The board of the regulated banking subsidiary
should also ensure that such decisions or practices are not detrimental to:
a) the sound and prudent management of the subsidiary;
b) the financial health of the subsidiary or,
c) the legal interests of the subsidiary’s stakeholders.

3.7

Principle 7 – Senior Management.
Under the direction of the board, senior management should ensure that the bank’s
activities are consistent with the business strategy, risk tolerance/appetite and policies
approved by the board.
Specific Requirements

3.7.1 Senior management consists of senior officers who are responsible and should be held
accountable for overseeing the day-to-day management of the bank. They include the
chief executive officer, the executive director, deputy chief executive officer (where
applicable), general manager (s), chief risk officer, chief operating officer, chief
financial officer, secretary to the board of directors, treasurer, chief internal auditor, or
manager of a significant unit of an institution.
3.7.2 Institutions are required to set up management committees to support its decision
making structures, increase efficiency and allow detailed deliberation on specific areas.
Each committee should have comprehensive terms of references that sets out its
mandate, scope of operations and working procedures. The composition and number of
committees will depend on factors such as the size of the institution, nature of its
business operations and its risk profile. However, the following committees are deemed
mandatory and should be constituted;

55

a) Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is the link between the board and management and is
responsible for implementation of operational plans, annual budgeting and periodic
reviews of operations, strategic plans, ALCO strategies, credit proposals review,
identification and management of key risks and opportunities. The committee shall
review and develop guidelines for employees’ remuneration for board approval.
The Executive Committee is constituted to assist the Chief Executive Officer to manage
the banking institution. The board of directors takes cognizance of authorities delegated
to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) by means of resolutions from time to time. The
Executive Committee assists the CEO guide and control the overall direction of the
business of the banking institution and acts as a medium of communication and coordination between business units and the board.
The Executive Committee shall also ensure that the risk management function has access
to any information it requires to fulfill its responsibilities.
b) Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO)
ALCO shall derive the most appropriate strategy for the banking institutions in terms of
the mix of assets and liabilities given its expectations of the future and the potential
consequences of interest-rate movements, liquidity constraints, and foreign exchange
exposure and capital adequacy.
The committee shall ensure that all strategies conform to the banking institution’s risk
appetite and levels of exposure as determined by the Board Risk Management
Committee or other committee assigned responsibility of risk management. In view of
the importance of ALCO in managing the bank’s balance sheet, it is required that every
institution should establish ALCO as a mandatory management committee. The
committee shall primarily be responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors
prudent asset/liability management policies and procedures that enable the bank to
achieve its goals while operating in full compliance with all requirements of the Banking
Act and CBK Prudential Guidelines.
3.7.3 No Senior Officer shall take up his position prior to being cleared by the Central
Bank. The institution shall submit to the Central Bank of Kenya duly completed fit and
proper form as prescribed in Guideline No. CBK/PG/01 on Licensing of New
Institutions.
Where a non-executive director who is cleared by the Central Bank is subsequently
appointed in an executive position, specific approval of the appointment shall be
56

obtained prior to taking up the position. The Central Bank of Kenya may use its powers,
under section 32 of the Banking Act to verify the accuracy of the information on the fit
and proper forms.
3.7.4 Senior management contributes substantially to a bank’s sound corporate governance
through personal conduct by providing adequate oversight of those they manage, and
by ensuring that the bank’s activities are consistent with the business strategy, risk
tolerance/appetite and policies approved by the bank’s board. These individuals should
have the necessary experience, competencies and integrity to manage the businesses
under their supervision as well as have appropriate control over the key individuals in
these areas.
3.7.5 The Head of Finance and Head of Internal Audit should be members of the Institute of
Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) and the Company Secretary must be a
member of the Institute of Certified Public Secretaries of Kenya (ICPSK) or similar
institutes recognized by the Central Banks of the East African Community member
states or an international institute recognized by ICPAK and ICPSK.
3.7.6 Major duties and responsibilities of management
The primary responsibility of the management is to operate and administer the
institution on a day-to-day basis paying attention to the following:
a) The implementation and adherence to the policies, practices and standards as laid
down by the Board of Directors;
b) The systems that have been established to facilitate efficient operations and
communications;
c) The planning process that has been developed to facilitate achievement of targets and
objectives;
d) All staff matters, particularly human resource development and training;
e) Adherence to the established code of conduct and with all the relevant banking laws
and CBK guidelines; and
f) Maintain adequate records to comply with all the reporting requirements.
3.7.7 Appointment and responsibilities of the Chief Executive
The board should appoint the chief executive and establish a framework for the
delegation of authority. The chief executive, who may be referred to as the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), the Managing Director (MD) or by any other title, shall be
wholly responsible to the Board for the day to day running of the institution. The
collective responsibility of management is vested in the Chief Executive and bears
ultimate responsibility for all management functions.

57

The Chief Executive is expected to undertake the following key responsibilities;.
a) Ensure that the policies spelt out by the board in the institution’s overall corporate
strategy of the institution are implemented;
b) Identify and recommend to the board competent officers to manage the operations of
the institution. In the fulfillment of this duty, the Chief Executive should ensure that
the institution’s human resources policy is adhered to;
c) Co-ordinate the operations of the various departments within the institution;
d) Establish and maintain efficient and adequate internal control systems;
e) Design and implement the necessary management information systems in order to
facilitate efficient and effective communication within the institution;
f) Ensure that the board is frequently and adequately appraised about the operations of
the institution through presentation of relevant board papers, which must cover, but
not limited to, the following areas:
 Actual performance compared with the past performance and the budget together
with explanations of all the variances.
 Capital structure and adequacy.
 Advances performance in particular problem loans, losses, recoveries and
provisions.
 Income and expenses.
 Deposits: sources and distribution profile.
 All insider transactions that benefit directly or indirectly any officer or shareholder
of the institution.
 Report on violation of laws and remedial activities undertaken to ensure
compliance with the banking laws and CBK guidelines.
 Large exposures.
 Non-performing insider loans.
 CBK, external, internal and audit committee reports.
 Any other areas relevant to the institution’s operations.
 Ensure that the institution complies with all the relevant banking and other
applicable laws in the execution of its operations.
 Any other duties as may be assigned by the board from time to time.
3.8

Principle 8 - Risk Management Framework
The board must ensure that the banking institution has adequate systems to identify,
measure, monitor and manage key risks facing the banking institution and adopt and
follow sound policies and objectives which have been fully deliberated.

58

Specific Requirements
3.8.1 The board‘s responsibility for risk management should be manifested in a documented
risk management policy and plan. Management should develop both the risk
management policy and the plan for approval by the board.
3.8.2 The board‘s scope of responsibility for risk governance should be expressed in its board
charter and supported by induction and training processes for all board members. Where
the board has delegated its responsibility for risk management to a board committee,
such board committee‘s terms of reference should reflect this responsibility and should
be approved by the board.
3.8.3 Institutions should have an independent risk management function with sufficient
authority, stature, independence, resources and access to the board. The oversight of
risk management should be assigned to a senior officer who may be referred to as the
Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or a Risk Manager (RM), and should report independently to
the Board Risk Management Committee. The CRO/RM should be a suitably
experienced person who should have access to, and interact regularly with the board and
appropriate board committee and executive management. The CRO/RM must
sufficiently be independent of the business lines in order to ensure an adequate
separation of duties and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.
3.8.4 Management is accountable to the board for designing, implementing and monitoring
the system and process of risk management and integrating it into the day-to-day
activities of the company. Risks should be identified and monitored on an ongoing firmwide and individual entity basis, and the sophistication of the bank’s risk management
and internal control infrastructures should keep pace with any changes to the bank’s risk
profile (including its growth), and to the external risk landscape.
3.8.5 As part of its quantitative and qualitative analysis, the bank should utilize forwardlooking stress tests and scenario analysis to better understand potential risk exposures
under a variety of adverse circumstances. These should be key elements of a bank’s risk
management process, and the results should be communicated to, and given appropriate
consideration by, the relevant business lines and individuals within the bank. A forwardlooking approach to risk management should include ongoing monitoring of existing
risks as well as identifying new or emerging risks.
3.8.6 Banks should have approval processes for new products. These should include an
assessment of the risks of new products, significant changes to existing products, the
introduction of new lines of business and entry into new markets. The risk management
function should provide input on risks as a part of such processes. This should include a
full and frank assessment of risks under a variety of scenarios, as well as an assessment
59

of potential shortcomings in the ability of the bank’s risk management and internal
controls to effectively manage associated risks. In this regard, the bank’s new product
approval process should take into account the extent to which the bank’s risk
management, legal and regulatory compliance, information technology, business line,
and internal control functions have adequate tools and the expertise necessary to manage
related risks.
3.8.7 Effective risk management requires robust internal communication within the bank
about risk, both across the organization and through reporting to the board and senior
management. Information should be communicated to the board and senior management
in a timely, complete, understandable and accurate manner so that they are equipped to
make informed decisions.
3.9

Principle 9 – Compliance with Laws, Rules, Codes and Standards
The board should ensure that the institution complies with applicable laws and considers
adherence to the institution’s rules, codes and standards.
Compliance risk can be described as the risk of damage, arising from non-adherence to
the law and regulations, to the institution‘s business model, objectives, reputation, going
concern, stakeholder relationships or sustainability.
Specific Requirements

3.9.1 The Institution should develop a compliance policy and the board should approve it.
Management should be responsible for implementing this policy and report to the board
regarding compliance with it.
3.9.2 Compliance risk should form part of the institution’s risk management process. The
risks of non-compliance should be identified, assessed and responded to through the
institution‘s risk management processes.
3.9.3 As part of the broader risk management structure, the institution should establish an
independent compliance function that provides assistance to the board and management
in complying with applicable laws, rules, codes and standards. The compliance officer
should report independently to the board, committee of the board or through the head
of risk and compliance function depending on the institution’s size and its
organizational structure.
3.9.4 Each institution should consider the suitable structure and size of its compliance
function, considering what is appropriate for the adequate management of the
60

compliance risk of the particular company and having regard to the legislative
requirements that apply to the compliance function. The structure of the compliance
function, its role and its position in terms of reporting lines, should reflect the
institution‘s decision on how compliance is integrated with its ethics and risk
management.
3.9.5 The board is responsible for the institution‘s compliance with applicable laws and with
rules, codes and standards with which the company may elect to comply. One of the
important responsibilities of the board is therefore to monitor the company‘s
compliance with all applicable laws, rules, codes and standards.
3.9.6 Directors should familiarize themselves sufficiently with the general content of
applicable laws, rules, codes and standards to be able to adequately discharge their
fiduciary duties in the best interests of the institution and their duty of care, skill and
diligence. Included in this duty is to make use of the rights and protection that the law
presents in the best interests of the institution.
3.10 Principle 10 - Internal Control Functions
The board and senior management should effectively utilize the work conducted by
internal audit functions, external auditors and internal control functions.
Specific Requirements
3.10.1 The board should recognize and acknowledge that independent, competent and
qualified internal and external auditors, as well as other internal control functions
(including the compliance functions), are vital to the corporate governance process in
order to achieve a number of important objectives. Senior management should also
recognize the importance of the effectiveness of these functions to the long-term
soundness of the bank. Towards this end, the board shall:
a. Set-up an effective internal audit department, staffed with qualified personnel to
perform internal audit functions, covering the traditional function of financial audit
as well as the function of management audit.
b. Set-up an independent Compliance Function that, among other things, routinely
monitor compliance with laws, corporate governance rules, regulations, codes and
policies to which the bank is subject and ensure that deviations are reported to an
appropriate level of management and, in case of material deviations, to the board.

61

3.11 Principle 11 - Compensation Systems
The board should actively oversee the compensation system’s design and operation, and
should monitor and review the compensation system to ensure that it operates as intended.
Specific Requirements
3.11.1 The board is responsible for the overall design and operation of the compensation
system for the entire bank. The board may constitute a board compensation committee
(may be referred as remuneration committee) as an integral part of their governance
structure to oversee the compensation system’s design and operation on behalf of the
board of directors. Members of the compensation committee should be independent,
non-executive members with substantial knowledge about compensation arrangements
and the incentives and risks that can arise from such arrangements. Because
compensation should be aligned with risk, an understanding of the firm’s risk
measurement and management, and of how different compensation practices can impact
the firm’s risk profile, is important as well.
3.11.2 The policy on the remuneration of directors, CEO and senior management should be
developed under conditions of objectivity and transparency. The levels of remuneration
should be sufficient to attract and retain directors of high caliber, but at the same time,
should also be balanced against the need to ensure that an institution’s funds are not
used to subsidize excessive remuneration packages and not compromising the ongoing
viability, solvency and reputation of an institution:
a. The compensation of the control function (e.g. Chief Risk Officer and risk
management staff) should be structured in a way that is based principally on the
achievement of their objectives and does not compromise their independence (i.e.
compensation should not be substantially tied to business line revenue).
b. Since employees can generate equivalent short-term revenues while taking on vastly
different amounts of risk in the longer term, a bank should ensure that variable
compensation is adjusted to take into account the risks an employee takes. This
should consider all types of risk over a timeframe sufficient for risk outcomes to be
revealed. It is appropriate to use both quantitative risk measures and human judgment
in determining risk adjustments. Where firms make such adjustments, all material
risks should be taken into account, including difficult-to-measure risks (eg
reputational risk) and potentially severe risk outcomes.
c. In addition to adjustments for future prospects or forecasted returns (ex ante risk
adjustments), institutions should take steps to better align compensation with prudent
risk taking measures. One characteristic of effective compensation outcomes is that
62

they are symmetric with risk outcomes, particularly at the bank or business line level.
That is, the size of the bank’s variable compensation pool should vary in response to
both positive and negative performance. Variable compensation should be diminished
or eliminated when a bank or business line incurs substantial losses.
d. Compensation should be sensitive to risk outcomes over a multi-year horizon. This is
typically achieved through arrangements that defer compensation until risk outcomes
have been realized, and may include ‚claw back‛ provisions whereby compensation
is reduced or reversed if employees generate exposures that cause the bank to
perform poorly in subsequent years or if the employee has failed to comply with
internal policies or legal requirements. ‚Golden parachute‛ arrangements under
which terminated executives or staff receive large payouts irrespective of
performance are generally not consistent with sound compensation practice.
e. The mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation (e.g. options) should be
consistent with risk alignment and will likely vary across employees, depending on
their position and role in the bank.
f. The remuneration of directors and the chief executive shall be commensurate with the
nature, size of operations of the institution and the remuneration offered for similar
positions in the market. Non-executive directors should not receive any salary.
g. As a matter of principle, the chief executive of a group should draw all his salary,
including benefits, from one source, usually the parent company. Where the chief
executive of an institution is entitled to receive director’s fees from that institution’s
subsidiaries, such fees should be nominal.
h. Key particulars of compensation should be disclosed in the Annual Report to the
public on a timely basis. The information should include the decision-making process
used to determine the compensation policy, criteria used for performance
measurement and risk adjustment, the amounts of remuneration for the financial year
and other key information on the incentive and compensation systems.
3.12 Principle 12 – Governance of Information Technology
The board should be responsible for Information Technology (IT) Governance. IT
governance can be considered as a framework that supports effective and efficient
management of IT resources to facilitate the achievement of a institution‘s strategic
objectives. IT governance is the responsibility of the board.

63

Specific Requirements
3.12.1 The board should ensure that an IT governance charter and policies are established and
implemented. The charter and policies should outline the decision-making rights and
accountability framework for IT governance that will enable the desirable culture in the
use of IT within the company.
3.12.2 The board should oversee the cultivation and promotion of an ethical IT governance
and management culture and awareness. The board should provide the required
leadership to achieve this institution‘s strategic objective.
3.12.3 The board should ensure that an IT internal control framework is adopted and
implemented and that the board receives independent assurance on the effectiveness
thereof. The necessary steps should be taken to ensure that there are processes in place
to ensure complete, timely, relevant, accurate and accessible IT reporting.
3.12.4 The board should ensure that the IT strategy is integrated with the institution‘s strategic
and business processes. IT should be seen to add value by enabling the improvement of
the institution‘s performance and sustainability.
3.12.5 The board may appoint an IT steering committee or similar forum or function to assist
with its governance of IT. There should be relevant representation from business and
IT functions.
3.12.6 Each institution should consider the suitable strategy, structure and size of its IT
function, considering what is appropriate for the adequate management of the IT
function and associated risk of the particular institution and having regard to any
legislative requirements that apply to the IT function. The structure of the IT function,
its role and its position in terms of reporting lines, should reflect the company‘s
decision on how IT is integrated with its operations.
3.12.7 The board should oversee the proper value delivery of IT and should ensure that the
expected return on investment from significant IT investments and projects is delivered
and that the information and intellectual property contained in the information systems
are protected.
3.12.8 Where the responsibility for the provision of IT goods or services has been delegated to
another party (or division), all parties (including the board) remain accountable for
enforcing and monitoring effective IT governance.
3.12.9 Management should regularly demonstrate to the board that the institution has adequate
business resilience arrangements in place for disaster recovery and business continuity.
64

3.13 Principle 13 - Bank’s Operational Structure
The board and senior management should know and understand the bank’s operational
structure and the risks that it poses (i.e. ‚know-your-structure‛).
Specific Requirements
3.13.1 The board and senior management should understand the structure and the organization
of the group, i.e. the aims of its different units/entities and the formal and informal links
and relationships among the entities and with the parent company. This includes
understanding the legal and operational risks and constraints of the various types of
intra-group exposures and transactions and how they affect the group’s funding, capital
and risk profile under normal and adverse circumstances. Sound and effective measures
and systems should be in place to facilitate the generation and exchange of information
among and about the various entities, to manage the risks of the group as a whole, and
for the effective supervision of the group.
3.13.2 The board should approve policies and clear strategies for the establishment of new
structures and should properly guide and understand the bank's structure, its evolution
and its limitations.
3.13.3 In order to enhance the sound governance of a banking group, internal audits of
individual entities could be complemented with regular assessments of the risks posed
by the group’s structure. Periodic reports that assess the bank’s overall structure and
individual entities’ activities, confirm compliance with the strategy previously approved
by the board, and disclose any possible discrepancies could be useful for the audit and
risk committees, senior management and the board of the parent company.
3.13.4 The bank should discuss with, and/or report to, the Central Bank regarding policies and
procedures for the creation of new structures and the complexity of the group. This
should provide the bank with further guidance about ensuring adequate governance and
management throughout its operational structure.
3.14 Principle 14 - Disclosure Requirements
The governance of the bank should be adequately transparent to its shareholders,
depositors, other relevant stakeholders and market participants.

65

Specific Requirements
3.14.1 The bank should disclose relevant and useful information that supports the key areas of
corporate governance. Such disclosure should be proportionate to the size, complexity,
ownership structure and risk profile of the bank.
3.14.2 Accordingly disclosure should include, but not be limited to, material information on
the bank’s objectives, governance structures and policies (in particular the content of
any corporate governance code or policy and the process by which it is implemented),
major share ownership and voting rights and related parties transactions.
3.14.3 The bank should also disclose key points concerning its risk tolerance/appetite (without
breaching necessary confidentiality), with a description of the process for defining it and
information concerning the board involvement in such process. When involved in
complex or non-transparent structures, the bank should disclose adequate information
regarding the purpose, strategies, structures, risks and controls around such activities.
3.14.4 Disclosure should be accurate, clear and presented in an understandable manner and in
such a way that shareholders, depositors, other relevant stakeholders and market
participants can access it easily. Timely public disclosure is desirable on a bank’s public
website, in its annual and periodic financial reports or by other appropriate forms. It is
good practice that an annual corporate governance-specific and comprehensive statement
is in a clearly identifiable section of the annual report depending on the applicable
financial reporting framework. All material developments that arise between regular
reports should be disclosed without undue delay.

66

PART IV: CODE OF CONDUCT
4.1 APPLICABILITY
This code of conduct contained in this guideline is applicable to directors, chief
executive officers and management of institutions licensed under the Banking Act (Cap.
488). The Board of Directors should ensure that all officers adhere to the prescribed
code of conduct.
4.2 PRESCRIBED CODE OF CONDUCT
4.2.1 Conflict of Interest
Directors, chief executive officers and management should not engage directly or
indirectly in any business activity that competes or conflicts with the institution’s
interest. These activities include, although not necessarily limited to, the following:


Outside Financial Interest
Where directors, chief executive officers and management have a financial interest in a
customer, whether a sole proprietor, shareholder, creditor or debtor, such an interest
must be disclosed immediately to the management. Thereafter, the affected director,
chief executive officer and management should not be directly involved in the
institution’s dealings with the customer so long as the interest continues to exist.
The above restriction does not apply in cases where employees have holdings of public
quoted securities unless the management views the interests to be material, and that the
financial interest is considered likely to impair the objectivity of the member of staff
concerned. The holding of five per cent or more of the voting shares of a publicly quoted
company would be regarded as material.



Other Business Interests
It is considered a conflict of interest if an executive director, chief executive officer or
management conducts business other than the institution’s business during office hours.
Where the acquisition of any business interest or participation in any business activity
outside the institution and office hours demands excessive time and attention from the
member of staff, thereby depriving the institution of the employee’s best efforts on the
job, a conflict of interest is deemed to exist.



Other Employment
Before making any commitment, employees are to discuss possible part-time
employment or other business activities outside the financial institution’s working hours
with their manager or departmental head. A written approval of the manager or
departmental head should be obtained before an employee embarks on part-time

67

employment or other business activities. Approval should be granted only where the
interest of the institution will not be jeopardized.


Corporate Directorship
Employees must not solicit corporate directorships. An employee should not serve as a
director of another corporation without approval of the Board of Directors (or Chief
Executive, in case of foreign banks). Employees who hold directorships without such
approval must seek approval immediately, if they wish to remain as directors of other
corporations.
However, employees may act as directors of non-profit public service corporations, such
as religious, educational, cultural, social, welfare, and philanthropic or charitable
institutions, subject to policy guidelines of the institution.



Trusteeships
Directors, chief executive officers and management must not solicit appointments as
executors, administrators or trustees of customers’ estates. If such an appointment is
made and the employee is a beneficiary of the estate, his signing authority for the
estate’s bank account(s) must be approved by the Board of Directors, who will not
unreasonably withhold approval.

4.2.2 Misuse of Position
a) Directors, chief executive officers and management must not use the institution’s
name or facilities for personal advantage in political, investment or retail purchasing
transactions, or in similar types of activities. Directors, chief executive officers and
management, and their relatives must also not use their connection with the
institution to borrow from or become indebted to customers or prospective
customers. The use of position to obtain preferential treatment, such as purchasing
goods, shares and other securities, is prohibited.
b) Directors, chief executive officers and management must not solicit or otherwise
accept inducements either directly or indirectly whether in cash or in kind in order to
provide any favours to a customer in the provision of loans, acceptance of deposits or
any other conduct of the business of the institution to which they are entrusted either
jointly or individually.
c) Further, directors, chief executive officers and management must not use the
institution’s facilities and influence for speculating in commodities, gold, silver,
foreign exchange or securities, whether acting personally or on behalf of friends or
relatives. Such misuse of position may be ground for dismissal and/or prosecution.
Directors, chief executive officers and management should also not engage in ‚backscratching‛ exercises with employees and directors of other institutions to provide
68

mutually beneficial transactions in return for similar facilities, designed to
circumvent these ethical guidelines.
4.2.3 Misuse of Information
a) Directors, chief executive officers and management should not deal in the securities
of any company listed or pending listing on a stock exchange at any time when in
possession of information, obtained by virtue of employment or connection with the
institution, which is not generally available to shareholders of that company and the
public, and which, if it were so available, would likely bring a material change in the
market price of the shares or other securities of the company concerned. ‚Insider
dealing‛ as this is called, is a crime.
b) Directors, chief executive officers and management who possess insider information
are also prohibited from influencing any other person to deal in the securities
concerned or communicating such information to any other person, including other
members of staff who do not require such information in discharging their duty.
4.2.4 Integrity of Records and Transactions
a. Accounting records and reports must be complete and accurate. Directors, chief
executive officers and management should never make entries or allow entries to be
made for any account, record or document of the institution that are false and would
obscure the true nature of the transaction, as well as to mislead the true authorization
limits or approval authority of such transactions. Members of staff and directors of
institutions should note carefully the provisions of Sections 48 and 50 of the Banking
Act.
b. All records and computer files or programmes of the institution, including personnel
files, financial statements and customer information must be accessed and used only
for management purposes for which they were originally intended.
4.2.5 Confidentiality
(a) Confidentiality of relations and dealings between the institution and its customers is
paramount in maintaining the institution’s reputation. Thus directors, chief executive
officers and management must take precaution to protect the confidentiality of
customer information and transactions. No member of staff or director should
during, or upon and after termination of employment with the institution (except in
the proper course of his duty and or with the institution’s written consent) divulge or
make use of any secrets, copyright material, or any correspondence, accounts of the
institution or its customers. No employee or director shall in any way use
information so obtained for financial gain.

69

(b) Business and financial information about any customer may be used or made
available to third parties only with prior written consent of the customer or in
accordance with the arrangements for the proper interchange of information between
institutions about credit risks, or when disclosure is required by law.
4.2.6

Fair and Equitable Treatment
All business dealing on behalf of the institution with the current potential customers,
with other members of staff and with those who may have cause to rely upon the
institution, should be conducted fairly and equitably. Staff and directors must not be
influenced by friendship or association, either in meeting a customer’s requirement,
or in recommending that they be met. Such decisions must be made on a strictly
arms-length business basis. All preferential transactions with insiders or related
interests should be avoided. If transacted, such dealings should be in full compliance
with the law, judged on normal business criteria basis and fully documented and
duly authorized by the Board of Directors or any other independent party.

4.2.7

Insider Loans
Directors, chief executive officers and management should not use their positions to
further their personal interests. An institution shall not in Kenya therefore:
(a) Grant or permit to be outstanding any unsecured advances in respect of any of its
employees or their associates.
(b) Grant or permit to be outstanding any advances, loans or credit facilities which
are unsecured or advances, loans or credit facilities which are not fully secured to
any of its officers, significant shareholders or their associates.
(c) Grant or permit to be outstanding any advance, loan or credit facility to any of its
directors or other person participating in the management of the institution unless
it is:
 approved by the full board of directors of the institution upon being satisfied
that it is viable.
 made in the normal course of business and on terms similar to those offered
to ordinary customers of the institution. The institution shall notify the
Central Bank of Kenya of every such approval within seven days of the
granting of the approval.
(d) Grant or permit to be outstanding any advance, loan or credit facility or give any
financial guarantee or incur any other liability to, or in favour of, or on behalf of,
any associate or any of the persons mentioned in paragraphs 4.2.7 (a),(b) and (c)
in excess of twenty per cent of the core capital of the institution; or
(e) Grant or permit to be outstanding advances or credit facilities or give any
financial guarantee or incur any other liabilities to or in favor of, or on behalf of,
its associates and the persons mentioned in paragraphs 4.2.7 (a), (b) and (c)

70

amounting in the aggregate to more than one hundred per cent of the core capital
of the institution; or
(f) Grant any advance or credit facility or give guarantee or incur any liability or
enter into any contract or transaction or conduct its business or part thereof in a
fraudulent or reckless manner or otherwise than in compliance of the Banking
Act and Central Bank of Kenya guidelines.

PART V: REMEDIAL MEASURES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS
5.1 Remedial measures
5.1.1

When an officer is assessed and found to be unfit and not proper to work for an
institution, the affected institution shall be required to dispense with the services of
such an officer forthwith and to inform the Central Bank of Kenya of such a decision
as soon as possible. An institution that contravenes any of the provisions of this
guideline may be subject to corrective measures and administrative sanctions set out
below.

5.1.2 When an institution contravenes any of the provisions of the Banking Act or is not in
compliance with these guidelines then:
a) All officers of the institution shall be liable jointly and severally to indemnify the
institution against any loss arising in respect of the contravention of Section 11 of
the Banking Act.
b) In the case of violation of guidelines on an advance, loan or a credit facility to a
person other than a director of the institution or a person participating in the general
management of the institution, an officer shall not be so liable, provided he or she
shows that, through no act or omission on his or her part, he or she was not aware
that the contravention was taking place, or he or she took all reasonable steps to
prevent it taking place.
c) The Central Bank of Kenya may in the case of violation of guidelines on an advance,
loan or credit facility to a director of the institution, direct the removal of such
director from the Board of Directors of the institution. The Central Bank of Kenya
may direct the suspension of any other officer or employee of the institution who
sanctioned the advance, loan or credit facility. The institution shall comply with
every direction of the Central Bank of Kenya under this paragraph forthwith.

71

d) Any director of an institution who defaults in the repayment of any advance or loan
made to him by the institution for three consecutive months shall forthwith be
disqualified from holding office as such.
5.1.3 An institution which;

in the attached forms CBK/PG/19/F1, CBK/PG/19/F2 and CBK/PG/19/F3 should be taken
into consideration. These however, are by no means definitive or exhaustive and individual
institutions should tailor the questions to suit their own needs and circumstances.
The responses to these questions and others should enable institution’s boards to assess how
they are performing and to identify how certain elements of their performance areas might be
improved.

PART VII: GUIDANCE ON HOLDING OF BOARD MEETINGS THROUGH
VIDEO CONFERENCING
1. BACKGROUND
Board meetings are critical to all institutions. These meetings afford boards of directors an
opportunity to exercise their statutory and supervisory duties over institutions. Approvals,
evaluations and reviews by the boards on the activities of the institutions are carried out
during board meetings. Board meetings also enable board members to be updated on the
general management of the institutions.
Traditionally, board meetings have been held in physical premises where participating
members are present. Under this set up, members have to travel from their places of abode
to the meeting place to attend board meetings. The advent of information technology has
dramatically changed the ways of doing business. Technology has made it possible for
meetings to be held without the need to physically meet in one place. Teleconferencing,
Skype and video conferencing have become additional means by which meetings can be
held. The Central Bank takes cognizance of the convenience and cost saving opportunities
brought about by video conferencing. Many organizations and business entities are
increasingly embracing the practice of holding meetings through video conferencing. The
Central Bank is of the view that institutions that are desirous of holding some board
meetings through video conferencing should be able to do so under predetermined
guidelines.
The Central Bank views the use of video conferencing as a means by which institutions can
hold meetings where to do so would not jeopardize or prejudice the agenda of the meeting
or the expected deliberations. In this regard, the Central Bank hereby sets out minimum
requirements which should be met by institutions which would like to hold some of their
board meetings through video conferencing. It must however be noted that video
conferencing should not wholly substitute the traditional method of holding board meetings.
Physical contact during meetings is an integral part of an effective meeting and must
therefore continue to remain the main mode of holding meetings, even if video
conferencing is embraced.
2. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
Institutions are required to formulate documented policies and procedures on video
conferencing detailing amongst other things, the following;
1. The nature or kind of meetings that can be held through video conferencing.
2. There should be a mix of both physical meetings and video conferencing with respect to
the minimum number of meetings that a board should hold in one year.

78

3. Video conferencing as a means of holding meetings should be permitted in the Articles
of Association of the institution. It is also desirable that shareholders of the institution
approve the adoption of this technology.
4. The role of the board secretary for purposes of organizing, holding, taking minutes and
subsequent confirmation of the minutes of the last meeting held through video
conferencing is central. In this regard, the secretary should assume the following
responsibilities;
i) To facilitate the overall conduct of the meeting.
ii) To find reliable video conference equipment/facilities.
iii) To record the proceedings and prepare the minutes of the meeting.
iv) To store for safekeeping and mark the tape recordings and/or other electronic
recording mechanism as part of the records of the institution.
v) To send out the notices of the meeting to all directors in accordance with the
manner of giving notice as stated in the corporate by-laws. The notice should
contain the following information;
a) Inquiry on whether the director will attend physically or through video
conferencing;
b) Contact number(s) of the Secretary and office staff whom the director may call
to notify and state whether he shall be physically present or attend through video
conferencing;
c) Agenda of the meeting;
d) All documents to be discussed in the meeting, including attachments, should be
numbered and duly marked by the Secretary in such a way that all the directors,
physically or electronically present, can easily follow, refer to the documents
and participate in the meeting.
5. The Chair and the Secretary should have a well-coordinated plan on how to conduct the
meeting through video conferencing.
6. If the director chooses video conferencing, he should give notice of at least seven days
prior to the scheduled meeting to the Secretary. He should also inform the Secretary of
his contact number/s and furnish any other relevant information necessary for him to
effectively participate in the meeting via video conferencing. In the same way, the
Secretary shall inform the director concerned of the contact number/s he will call to join
the meeting. The Secretary shall keep the records of the details, and on the date of the
scheduled meeting confirm and note such details as part of the minutes of the meeting.
7. In the absence of a confirmation from a director that he will participate in the meeting
through video conferencing, it is presumed that the director will physically attend the
board meeting. At the start of the scheduled meeting, a roll call shall be made by the
Secretary. Every director and participant shall state, for the record, the following:
a. Full Name.
79

b. Location.
c. For those attending through video conferencing, they shall confirm that:
i. they can completely and clearly hear and see the others who can clearly hear and
see them on the other end.
ii. they have received the agenda and all the materials for the meeting
8. A roll call shall be taken and the Secretary may certify the existence of a quorum.
9. All participants shall identify themselves for the record, before speaking and must
clearly hear and/or see each other in the course of the meeting. If a person fails to
identify himself, the Secretary shall quickly state the identity of the last speaker. If the
person speaking is not physically present and the Secretary is not certain of the identity
of the speaker, the Secretary must inquire to elicit a confirmation or correction.
If a motion is objected to and there is a need to vote, the Secretary should call the roll
and note the vote of each director who should identify himself.
If a statement of a director/participant in the meeting via video conferencing is
interrupted or unclear, the Secretary shall request for a repeat or reiteration, and if need
be, the Secretary shall repeat what he heard the director/participant was saying for
confirmation or correction.
10. The Secretary shall prepare minutes which should be circulated to everyone who
attended the meeting for comments. The Secretary should then consider the comments
received and prepare revised draft minutes which should be presented to the board
members in the next meeting for their approval and adoption. The draft minutes can
further be amended shortly before adoption.
11. If for any failure arising from human or machine error or power outage it is not
possible to hold the meeting in the manner described herein above even if the meeting
has commenced, the meeting shall be deemed not to have been held.
12. Meetings held through video conferencing should not be rushed or otherwise conducted
in a manner as to leave some participants dissatisfied with the way the meeting is being
held. Participants should be accorded reasonable opportunity to make their contributions
to the discussions.
13. Up to twenty five (25%) of the actual meetings to be held in a year may be conducted
through video conferencing, provided that the majority of the directors are physically
present.
14. No director shall attend all board meetings in any given year through video
conferencing. While these are the minimum requirements, institutions have the
responsibility of formulating appropriate policies and procedures for holding effective
80

meetings. The policies once formulated should be approved by the board of directors
before implementation.
PART VIII: EFFECTIVE DATE

PART I PRELIMINARY
1.1

Title ” Guideline on Capital Adequacy

1.2

Authorization ” This Guideline is issued under section 33(4) of the Banking Act,
which empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue guidelines to be adhered to by
institutions in order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial system.
Section 18 of the Banking Act empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to prescribe the
minimum ratios that shall be maintained by institutions as between their core capital
and total capital on the one hand and their risk weighted assets and off-balance sheet
items on the other, and for that purpose, may also determine the method of
classifying and evaluating assets.

1.3

Application - Banks, financial institutions and mortgage finance companies licensed
to conduct banking business in Kenya under the Banking Act.

1.4

Definitions - Terms used within this guideline are as defined in the Banking Act and
as further defined below, or as reasonably implied by contextual usage:

1.4.1 ‚Commodity risk‛ is the risk that on- or off-balance sheet positions will be
adversely affected by movements in commodity prices. Commodities include
agricultural products, minerals (including oil) and precious metals (excluding Gold).
Commodity risk only has a general market risk component because commodity
prices are not influenced by specific market risk. Commodity risk comprises of
directional risk which is the most important risk, basis risk, interest rate risk and
forward gap risk. Directional risk is the exposure to changes in spot prices arising
from net open positions. Basis risk is the risk that the relationship between the prices
of similar commodities changes over time. Forward gap and interest rate risk is the
exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches.
1.4.2 ‚Core Capital‛ (Tier 1) - Is as defined in Section 2(1) of the Banking Act namely
as permanent shareholders’ equity (issued and fully paid-up ordinary shares and
perpetual non-cumulative preference shares), disclosed reserves such as ordinary
share capital and perpetual non-cumulative share premium, retained earnings and
50% un-audited after tax profits less investments in subsidiaries conducting banking
business, investment in equity instruments of other institutions, intangible assets
(excluding computer software) and goodwill. The current year to date 50% unaudited after tax profits will qualify as part of core capital, if and only if, the
institution has made adequate provisions for loans and advances, proposed dividends
and other appropriations have been deducted.

83

1.4.3

‚Capital Conservation Buffer’’ - is a ratio of extra capital to risk weighted assets
over and above the set minimum capital ratios, required to be maintained by
institutions as a buffer for losses during periods of financial and economic stress.

1.4.4 ‚Credit Risk’’ - is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising
from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract with the bank or if an
obligor otherwise fails to perform as agreed.
1.4.5 ‚Financial Instrument‛ - is any contract that gives to both parties a financial asset
of one entity and a financial liability of another entity. Financial instruments
include both primary financial instruments (and cash instruments) and derivative
financial instruments. A financial asset is any asset that is cash, the right to receive
cash or another financial asset; or the contractual right to exchange financial assets
on potentially favourable terms. A financial liability is the contractual obligations to
deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial liabilities under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable.
1.4.6 ‚Foreign Exchange Risk‛ refers to the risk that the value of on or off-balance
sheet positions will be adversely affected by movements in exchange rates.
Positions denoted in foreign currency may decline in value due to movements in
exchange rates. Foreign currency is any currency other than the bank's reporting
currency. Foreign exchange risk only has a general market risk component because
movements in exchange rates are not affected by issuer- or issuance-specific
factors.
1.4.7 ‚General Market Risk‛ refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in the
general market behaviour. It is the risk of a price change in the underlying
instrument owing (in the case of a traded loan-stock instrument or loan-stock
derivative), to a change in the level of interest rates or (in the case of a security or
security derivative), to a broad market movement unrelated to any specific
attributes of the individual securities. In the case of a fixed income instrument,
general market risk is driven by a change in the yield curve.
1.4.8 ‚Interest Rate Risk’’ is the potential for losses in on- or off-balance sheet positions
from adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate-dependent instruments can be
affected by both general and specific market risk.
1.4.9 ‚Market Risk‛ is defined as the risk of losses in on and off-balance sheet positions
arising from movements in market prices. These risks pertain to interest rate
related instruments in the trading book, commodities risk though out the bank,
equities risk and foreign exchange risk both in the trading and banking book of
financial institutions.
84

1.4.10 ‚Market risk Qualifying Assets‛ includes interest rate risk assets in the trading
book and foreign currency and commodities risk assets throughout the bank.
1.4.11 ‚Market Risk Weighted Equivalents‛ Capital charge emanating from the market
risk calculation to a risk weighted equivalent.
1.4.12 ‚Operational Risk’’ is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
1.4.13 ‚Positions Held with Trading Intent‛ - are those held intentionally for shortterm resale and/or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term
price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits, and may include for example
proprietary positions, positions arising from client servicing (e.g. matched
principal broking) and market making.
1.4.14 ‚Specific Risk‛ - Refers to potentially adverse movement in the price of an
individual loan/debt owing to factors related to the individual issuers. Specific risk
does not affect foreign exchange- and commodities-related instruments. This is
because changes in FX rates and commodities prices are completely dependent on
general market movements.
1.4.15 ‚Supplementary Capital‛ (Tier 2) ” Is as defined in Section 2(1) of the Banking
Act and includes 25% of asset revaluation reserves which have received prior
Central Bank’s approval, subordinated debt, issued and paid-in hybrid (debt equity)
capital instruments or any other capital instrument approved by Central Bank.
Supplementary capital must not exceed core capital.
1.4.16 ‚Subordinated Debt‛ - includes issued and paid-in unsecured subordinated debt
instruments (debt equity, lines of credit, bonds, commercial paper or loan capital)
having an original maturity of at least five years. Principal should be repayable after
at least five (5) years. It also includes issued and paid-in limited life redeemable
preference shares and loan loss reserves held against future, presently unidentified
losses. During the last 5 years to maturity, a cumulative discount (amortization)
factor of 20% per annum will be applied to reflect the diminishing value of these
instruments as a continuing source of strength. Since subordinated debt is not
normally available to participate in losses, the amount included for capital adequacy
calculations is limited to 50% of core capital.
1.4.17 ‚Trading Book‛ Consists of positions in financial instruments which are held with
trading intent or in order to hedge other elements of the trading book and are free of

85

any restrictive covenants on their tradability, frequently and accurately valued and
are actively managed.
1.4.18 ‚Total Capital‛ - means core capital plus supplementary capital.
PART II STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1 Purpose
This Guideline is intended to ensure that each institution maintains a level of capital that is
adequate to protect its depositors and creditors, commensurate with the risk associated with
activities and profile of the institution, and promotes public confidence in the institution.
2.2 Responsibility
The Board of directors of each institution shall be responsible for establishing and
maintaining, at all times, an adequate level of capital. The capital standards herein are the
minimum acceptable for institutions that are fundamentally sound, well-managed, and
which have no material financial or operational weaknesses. Higher capital ratios may be
required for individual institutions based on circumstances listed under Part IV, section 4.2
below.
PART III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
3.0 Capital requirements for a specific institution may increase or decrease depending
upon its risk profile. An institution’s minimum capital requirement (MCR) will be
calculated by dividing its Core and Total Capital by the sum of the value of its RiskWeighted Assets for Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk, to arrive at the
minimum Tier One and Regulatory capital adequacy ratios respectively.
3.1 Capital Charge for Credit Risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility of losses associated with reduction of credit quality of
borrowers or counterparties. In institutions’ portfolio, losses arise from outright default due
to inability or unwillingness of an obligor to meet commitments in relation to lending,
trading settlements, or any other financial transaction. Alternatively, losses occur from
reduction in portfolio value due to deterioration in credit quality.
The capital risk charge for credit risk is therefore the allocation of capital for the various
risk assets by assigning them risk weights based on their category and risk profiles.

86

3.2 Capital Charge for Market Risk
Institutions are required to assess, measure and apply capital charges in respect of their
market risks in addition to their credit risk. Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on
and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. For the purpose
of this guideline the risks subject to this requirement are;
a) The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments;
b) Foreign exchange risk and commodities risk throughout the bank.
3.2.1 Basis for Capital Charge for Market Risk
The basis and framework for Central Bank of Kenya to apply capital charges in respect to
specific and general market risks will be done using the Standardized Measurement
Approach. All the institutions will initially be required to use the Standardized
Measurement Method (as shown in Forms C, C1, C2 & C3), from the effective date of
this guideline. At such time to be determined by the Central Bank of Kenya, institutions that
wish to use internal rating models may apply to Central Bank for approval to use such
models in applying capital charge for market risk.
3.3 Capital Charge For Operational Risk
The guideline also introduces a capital charge for operational risk. Generally there are three
methods for calculating operational risk capital charges in a continuum of increasing
complexity and risk sensitivity. These are; the Basic Indicator approach (a fixed percentage
of gross income amount), the Standardized approach (sum of a certain percentage of an
institution’s income in each business line) and Internal Measurement approach (Statistical
measure of an institution’s operational loss based on its historical loss data). For the
purposes of this guideline, Basic Indicator Approach shall be used for calculating the capital
charge against operational risk.
CBK encourages institutions to adopt more advanced approaches as they develop more
sophisticated operational risk measurement systems and practices. However, the use of such
models shall only be approved by CBK at such time to be determined.

87

PART IV SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Minimum Capital Requirements
4.1.1 Minimum Ratios
Unless a higher minimum ratio has been set by the Central Bank of Kenya for an individual
institution based on criteria set under Section 4.2 below, every institution shall, at all times,
maintain:
a)
b)
c)

A core capital of not less than eight per cent of total risk weighted assets plus risk
weighted off-balance sheet items;
A core capital of not less than eight per cent of its total deposit liabilities;
A total capital of not less than twelve per cent of its total risk weighted assets plus risk
weighted off-balance sheet items. The computation of total capital requirement is as
shown below;

Eligible Tier I and Tier II Capital
(Credit Risk Weighted Assets ” Assets
Associated with market Risk) +Market Risk
Qualifying Assets + Operational Risk Charge

The Institution’s Capital Adequacy
= Ratio (Ratio must be at least 12%
of which 8% is Core Capital)

4.1.2 Capital Conservation Buffer
In addition to the above minimum capital adequacy ratios of 8% and 12%, institutions are
required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% over and above these minimum ratios
to enable the institutions withstand future periods of stress. This brings the minimum core
capital to risk weighted assets and total capital to risk weighted assets requirements to
10.5% and 14.5%, respectively. The capital conservation buffer should be made up of high
quality capital which should comprise mainly of common equity, premium reserves and
retained earnings.
Institutions that currently meet the minimum capital ratios of 8% and 12% but remain
below the buffer-enhanced ratios of 10.5% and 14.5% (current minimums plus conservation
buffer) should maintain prudent earnings retention policies with a view to meeting the
conservation buffer within 24 months from the effective date of this guideline.

The above ratios are subject to review and may be changed from time to time.
4.1.3 Minimum Absolute Core Capital Requirement
Minimum core capital for banks, mortgage finance companies and financial institutions is as
stated below:
a) Banks and Mortgage Finance Companies: Kshs.1,000 million (1 billion).
b) Financial Institutions: Kshs.200 million.
Institutions’ minimum core capital levels will be monitored on a continuous basis by the
Central Bank of Kenya. These levels will apply to all institutions and may be reviewed from
time to time.
4.2 Criteria for Higher Minimum Capital Ratios
The Central Bank may require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual institution
based on, but not limited to any one or more of the following criteria:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

The institution has incurred or is expected to incur losses resulting in a capital
deficiency;
The institution has significant exposure to risk, whether credit, concentrations of credit,
market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, or from other non-traditional activities;
The institution has a high or particularly severe volume of poor quality assets;
The institution is growing rapidly either internally or through acquisitions;
The institution is adversely affected by the activities or condition of its holding
company, associates or subsidiaries; or
The institution has deficiencies in ownership or management (i.e. shareholding
structure; composition or qualifications of directors or senior officers; risk management
policies and procedures).

89

4.3 Capital Charge for Risk Weighted Assets
4.3.1 Risk Weighted Assets for Credit Risk
Risk based approach to capital adequacy measurement applies to both on and off-balance
sheet items. The focus of this section is credit risk, namely the potential risk of counter
party default.
4.3.1.1 On-Balance Sheet Items
This framework uses only four weights, i.e. 0%, 20%, 50% and 100%. Credit exposures
are risk weighted and classified into the four categories according to their relative risk.
a) Zero % Weight
The on-balance sheet assets which have been assigned a 0% weight include: cash (both
domestic and foreign); loans and advances secured by cash; balances with the Central Bank
of Kenya (including repo purchase transactions); claims on the Kenya Government by way
of Government securities; and loans duly guaranteed by the Government of Kenya. Such
Government guarantees should have been approved by the appropriate authorities in
accordance with applicable laws and Government procedures; and loans duly guaranteed by
OECD1 Central Governments. However, the weight for loans guaranteed by an OECD
Central Government whose credit rating has been downgraded will be enhanced based on
the extent of the downgrade.
b) 20% Weight
The 20% weight will be assigned to deposits and balances due from commercial banks,
financial institutions, mortgage finance companies and building societies in Kenya. They
should also include securities issued by foreign governments and banks and balances due
from foreign banks; loans duly guaranteed by other EAC member states 2 approved by the
appropriate authorities in accordance with applicable laws and government procedures;
claims (loans and advances) guaranteed by the following Multi-Lateral Development Banks
(MDBs):
(i)
(ii)

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
The Inter-American Development Bank

OECD members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and
United States.

The European Investment Bank
Other MDBs in which G10 countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, Sweden,
France, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, United States and
Japan) are shareholding members.

c) 50% Weight
Mortgage loans fully secured by first legal charge over residential properties located within
cities and municipalities in the Republic of Kenya that are either occupied by the borrower
or rented will attract risk weight of 50%. The 50% weight will not be applied to loans
granted to companies engaged in speculative residential building or property development.
The underlying security held must be perfected in all respects and its forced sale value
(FSV) should cover in full the outstanding debt with at least 20% margin. Any portion of
the loan in excess of 80% of the FSV of the residential property should attract a risk weight
of 100%. The account should neither be in arrears nor exhibit any weakness. Rescheduled
facilities shall carry a risk weight of 100%.
d) 100% Weight
The on-balance sheet items assigned the 100% weight are all other claims on the public and
private sector which are not covered under the other categories, including deposits in
institutions under statutory management, balances from other foreign entities other than
banks, premises and other fixed assets, loans and advances, bills discounted and all other
assets of the institution.
4.3.1.2 Off-Balance Sheet Exposures
Off balance sheet items shall be converted to credit risk equivalents by multiplying the
nominal principal amounts by a credit conversion factor. The resulting amounts will then be
weighted depending on the nature of counterparty. For example, if the counterparty is a
local bank, then the resulting amount shall be multiplied by a risk weight of 20%. The
credit conversion factors listed below shall apply for various categories of off-balance sheet
items, except for interest rate and exchange rate related items.
a) Zero % conversion factor
Short-term commitments with an original maturity of up to one year and cancellable
unconditionally at any time e.g. bills for collection and any other contingent liability fully
secured by cash.

91

b) 20% conversion factor
Short-term self-liquidating trade related contingencies arising from the movement of goods
e.g. documentary credit collateralized by underlying shipments, and guarantees by
Multilateral Development Banks specified in 4.3.1.1 (b)
c) 50% conversion factor
Transactions related to contingent items and other commitments with an original maturity
exceeding one year e.g. performance bonds, bid bonds and standby letters of credit relating
to a particular transaction.
d) 100% conversion factor
These are off- balance sheet items, which are substitutes for loans, e.g. letters of guarantee,
bank acceptances and standby letters of credit serving as financial guarantees for loans and
securities.
4.3.1.3 Foreign exchange and interest rate related contingencies
Foreign exchange and interest rate related contracts need special treatment, as the banks are
not exposed to credit risk for the full face value of their contracts but only to the cost of
replacing the cash flow if the counterparty defaults. While computing the credit risk of
these contracts, financial institutions shall use the original exposure method. Institutions
will apply one of the two sets of the conversion factors to the original principal amounts of
each instrument according to the nature of the instrument and its maturity. The resulting
amounts will then be weighted against the risk weight associated with the counterparty.
The conversion factors for interest rate and exchange rate contracts are to be based on
residual maturity period as shown in the table below:
Residual maturity
Exchange rate contracts
One year or less
0.5%
Over one year to two years
1.0%
For each additional year

4.3.2 Capital Charge for Market Risk
4.3.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to ensure that institutions which have significant exposure to
market risks maintain adequate capital to support that exposure, in addition to capital
92

requirements for credit and operational risks. The section also sets out the CBK’s approach
in determining the adequacy of capital to support potential losses arising from market risk.
4.3.2.2 Applicability of market risk capital requirements
In the same way as for credit risk, the market risk capital requirement applies to all
institutions under the supervision of the CBK. Institutions are required to report their
market risk exposures on a monthly basis using the Market Risk Reporting templates
(Forms C, C1, C2 & C3), attached to this guideline. Institutions are required to complete
the templates on:
 A solo basis, covering the market risk exposure positions of the institution on a monthly
basis, and
 A consolidated basis, covering the market risk exposure positions of the institution and
its subsidiaries on an annual basis.
 No netting or offsetting requirements is permitted.
The subsidiaries of foreign banks operating in Kenya, where the CBK is not the lead/home
supervisor, are subject to the market risk capital requirements on a solo basis
4.3.2.3 Risk measurement framework
Generally market risk covers interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and
equity risk. For the purpose of this guideline equity risk is not covered since trading in
equities by institutions is prohibited in the Banking Act. To determine the level of capital to
be held against market risk an institution should calculate capital charge on the following
risks:



Risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments in the trading book,
Foreign exchange risk and Commodity risk throughout the institution.

4.3.2.4 Positions Eligibility Requirements
The following will be the basic requirements for positions eligible to receive trading book
capital treatment:
i) Clearly documented trading strategy for the position/instrument or portfolios, approved
by senior management (which would include expected holding horizon).
ii) Clearly defined policy and procedures for the active management of the position, which
must include:
 positions are managed on a trading desk;
 position limits are set and monitored for appropriateness;
 dealers have the autonomy to enter into/manage the position within agreed limits and
according to the agreed strategy;
93





positions are marked to market at least daily;
positions are reported to senior management as an integral part of the institution’s
risk management process; and
Positions are actively monitored with reference to market information sources
(assessment should be made of the market liquidity or the ability to hedge positions
or the portfolio risk profiles). This would include assessing the quality and
availability of market inputs to the valuation process, level of market turnover, sizes
of positions traded in the market, etc.

iii) The institutions are expected to have an established policy for allocating transactions
(including internal deals) to the trading or non-trading book, as well as procedures to
ensure compliance with such a policy. In addition, there must be a clear audit trail at
the time each transaction is entered into. The Central Bank will examine the adequacy
of such policy and procedures and its consistent implementation. For this purpose,
institutions which engage in trading activities should submit to CBK a policy statement
covering the definition of trading activities and the financial instruments which can be
traded or used for hedging the trading book portfolios.
iv) Clearly defined policy and procedures to monitor the positions against the bank’s
trading strategy including the monitoring of turnover and stale positions in the bank’s
trading book.
The financial instruments and transactions allocated to the regulatory trading book as
referred to in the preceding paragraphs include:
(i)
(ii)

Equity assets including forwards.
Bonds, notes obligations, Treasury bills bonds; similar financial instruments, rated
or unrated, even forward acquisitions.
(iii)
Short sales on (i) and (ii) above.
(iv)
Derivatives on interest rate risk
(v)
Hedging derivatives.
(vi)
Financial futures contracts (excluding equity futures)
(vii) Forward contracts including forward rate agreements;
(viii) Swaps, and
(ix)
Options
(x)
Other similar capital market instruments; (excluding equity related instruments)
The CBK considers transactions to carry a trading intent on the part of the financial
institution if:
(i) The position arising there from is marked to market on a daily basis (where possible)
as part of the internal risk management process.
(ii) The positions are not, or not intended to be, held to maturity; and
94

(iii) The positions satisfy other criteria the financial institution applies to its trading
portfolio.
Although regular reporting will in principle take place only at intervals, banks are expected
to manage the market risk in such a way that the regulatory capital requirements are being
met on a continuous basis i.e. at the close of each business day.
4.3.2.5 Measurement Methods
Two common methods for the measurement of market risk are:
i) The standardised approach; and
ii) The internal models approach.
(a) Standardised approach
For the purpose of this guideline, all institutions will be required to adopt the standardised
approach in calculation of capital charge for market risk. Under this approach, market risk
is measured by a standardised risk-weighting system in which the risk weights are based on
the types of positions and financial instruments held by an institution. The approach will be
used to measure and report interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk.
Details of the method of measurement are set out in the returns and (c) below.
(b) Internal Models Approach
The internal models approach allows those institutions with the necessary systems to use
their own internal risk management models to calculate market risk. The use of this
approach will be considered in the future and subject to approval of CBK.
(c) Interest Rate Risk under the Standardised Approach
The use of the standardized approach to calculate interest rate risk uses the ‚buildingblock‛ approach for specific risk and general risk.
The capital charges for interest rate related instruments will apply to the current market
value of items in a banking institution’s trading book(s). Interest rate related instruments
include all fixed-rate and floating-rate debt securities, interest rate derivatives and
instruments that behave like them, including non-convertible preference shares and traded
mortgage securities. Interest rate derivatives include all derivatives contracts and offbalance-sheet instruments which react to changes in interest rates, e.g. interest rate futures,
forward rate agreements (FRAs), interest rate and cross currency swaps, interest rate
options, forward foreign exchange positions, and mortgage derivative products.

95

Convertible bonds, i.e. debt issues or preference shares that are convertible, at a stated
price, into common shares of the issuer, will be treated as debt securities.
Institutions are required to notify the CBK whenever new instruments are introduced.
The trading portfolio attracts two types of risk capital charges:
i) Specific risk charges, and
ii) General risk charges.
The specific risk component is the risk of a price change in the underlying instrument
owing to factors related to the issuer of the instrument, or, in the case of a derivative, the
issuer of the underlying instrument.
The general risk component is a capital charge for the risk of a price change in the
underlying instrument owing (in the case of a traded loan-stock instrument or loan-stock
derivative) to a change in the level of interest rates or (in the case of a security or security
derivative) to a broad market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of the individual
securities.
The Market Risk template (Form C1) provides the framework for calculating a notional
capital charge for interest rate risk. Separate maturity ladders should be used for each
currency and capital charges should be calculated for each currency separately and then
summed with no offsetting between positions of opposite sign.
In the case of those currencies in which business is insignificant, separate maturity ladders
for each currency are not required. Rather, the bank may construct a single maturity ladder
and slot, within each appropriate time-band, the net long or short position for each
currency. However, these individual net positions are to be summed within each time-band,
irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a gross position figure.
(d) Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the value of foreign exchange positions may be
adversely affected by movements in currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk incurs
only general market risk. The capital charge requirement for positions held in foreign
currencies, including gold, is calculated at 10% of the overall net open position using the
‘Shorthand’ method. The two steps followed to calculate the overall net open position are;
i) Determine the exposure in each currency.
ii) Determine the overall net open position across FX exposures using the ‘Shorthand’
method. Under this method, the overall net open position is the higher of the sum of all

96

net open short positions or the sum of long positions in all currencies (refer to
computation in the completion notes).
All on- and off-balance sheet items in foreign currency, whether held in the trading book or
banking book, are subject to this charge. Banks and financial institutions shall report exposures
for individual currencies separately, although small currency holdings may be aggregated.
(e) Commodities Exchange Risk
Commodity risk is the risk that on- or off-balance sheet positions will be adversely affected by
movements in commodity prices. A commodity is defined as a physical product that can be
traded on a secondary market. They include agricultural products, minerals (including oil) and
precious metals (excluding gold which is treated as a foreign currency).
Commodity risk comprises directional risk which is the most important risk, basis risk, interest
rate risk and forward gap risk. Directional risk is the exposure to changes in spot prices arising
from net open positions. Basis risk is the risk that the relationship between the prices of similar
commodities alters over time. Forward gap and interest rate risk is the exposure to changes in
forward prices arising from maturity mismatches.
All commodity derivatives and off-balance sheet positions which are affected by changes in
commodity prices should be included in this measurement framework. Long and short positions
in each commodity may be reported on a net basis for the purposes of calculating open positions.
However, as a general rule, positions in different commodities are not off-settable in this manner.
4.3.3 Capital Charge for Operational Risk
4.3.3.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to guide all institutions which by nature of their business are
exposed to operational risk, to maintain adequate capital to support their exposure to
operational risk, in addition to the capital requirements for credit and market risk.
4.3.3.2 The Basic Indicator Approach
Under the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), the capital charge for operational risk is a fixed
percentage (denoted by alpha) of average positive annual gross income of the institution
over the past three years. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or
zero, should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the
average. The formula for calculating operational risk together with the data capturing form
is provided with this guideline (See Form D below).

97

4.4

Internal Capital Assessment Adequacy Planning (ICAAP)

ICAAP is a system of sound, effective and complete strategies and processes that allow
institutions to assess and maintain, on an ongoing basis, the amounts, types and distribution
of internal capital that they consider adequate to cover the nature and level of risks to which
they are or might be exposed.
Institutions are required to ensure that they at all times plan their capital ahead for a
minimum of three years and ideally for five years, and to establish and maintain on an
ongoing basis an adequate level of capital, which would include an appropriate buffer, as
determined by the board, above the regulatory required minimum capital. This requires
institutions to have in place appropriate and proportionate capital management strategy.
A sound capital assessment process should include the following elements:
(i) A clear and documented process for evaluating risks and determining whether or not a
risk should result in an explicit amount of capital being held.
(ii) Policies and procedures designed to ensure that the institution identifies, measures and
reports all material risks requiring capital.
(iii) A process that relates capital to current and anticipated future levels of risk in
accordance with board approved risk tolerance.
(iv) A process that states capital adequacy goals with respect to risk, taking account of the
institution’s strategic focus and business plan.
(v) A process of internal controls reviews and audits to ensure the integrity of the overall
risk management process.
Comprehensive assessment of risks
The ICAAP should address all material risks faced by the institution as they relate to the
adequacy of capital, including all risks explicitly captured in minimum regulatory capital
requirements as well as risks that are not fully captured under minimum regulatory capital
requirements. The techniques used in assessing material risks should be commensurate with
the scope and complexity of the institution’s risk taking activities.
Stress testing
An institution’s capital planning process should incorporate rigorous, forward-looking
stress testing that identifies possible events or changes in market conditions that could
98

adversely impact the institutions. In their ICAAPs, institutions should examine future
capital resources and capital requirements under adverse scenarios. The results of forwardlooking stress testing should be considered when evaluating the adequacy of an institution’s
capital.
For further guidance on stress testing expectations, institutions should refer to Guideline on
Stress Testing (CBK/PG/20).
Monitoring and reporting
The institution should establish an adequate system for monitoring and reporting risk
exposures and assessing how changes to the institutions risk profile affects the need for
capital. The institution’s senior management and board of directors should receive regular
reports on the institution’s risk profile and capital needs.
Internal control review
The institution should conduct periodic reviews of its risk management process to ensure its
integrity, accuracy, and reasonableness. Effective control of the capital assessment process
includes an independent review and, where appropriate, the involvement of internal and
external audits.
4.5

Reports to Central Bank

Each institution shall submit to Central Bank of Kenya the return on Capital to Risk
Weighted Assets, Form CBK/PR3, at the end of every month, to be received by the 10th
day of the following month in which the return relates. The Central Bank may require such
other information as is necessary to evaluate compliance with this guideline and may call
for adjustments to capital where necessary.
PART V REMEDIAL MEASURES
5.1 Remedial measures – Central Bank may pursue any or all remedial actions as
provided under Sections 33, 34 and 55 of the Banking Act and the Prompt Corrective
Action Guideline (CBK/PG/21).
5.2 Administrative sanctions - In addition to the use of corrective actions noted in 5.1
above, the Central Bank may pursue any or all of the following administrative
sanctions against an institution, its board of directors, or its officers:

COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS
RETURN CBK/PR3: CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS
1. CAPITAL COMPONENTS
1.1 CORE CAPITAL (TIER 1)
1.1.1 Paid-up ordinary share capital/Assigned Capital
This is the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued and fully paid, or capital assigned to
Kenyan branch(es).
1.1.2 Non-repayable share premium/(discount)
This is the difference between the nominal price and purchase price of shares, which is not
refundable/recoverable.
1.1.3 Retained Earnings/ Accumulated losses
These are retained earnings or accumulated losses from the profits/losses of the prior years.
They should however exclude reserves arising from revaluation of investment properties
and cumulative unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments.
1.1.4 Current year 50% un-audited after tax profits
This is 50% of the current year to date un-audited after tax profits. The institution must
have made adequate provisions for loans and advances, depreciation, amortization and other
expenses. In arriving at the applicable figure, any proposed or interim dividends have to be
taken into account. This should however exclude reserves arising from revaluation of
investment properties and cumulative unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments.
In case of a loss, full amount should be included.
1.1.5 Non-cumulative irredeemable preference shares
These are shares, which have a standing claim on the company every year, but the claim is
not carried forward in event of not being paid and they are not redeemable.

104

1.1.5 Other reserves
These are all other reserves, which have not been included above. Such reserves should be
permanent, unencumbered, uncallable and thus able to absorb losses. Further, the reserves
should exclude cumulative unrealized gains and losses on available-for- sale-instruments.
1.1.6 Sub-total
Enter in this line the sub-total of all the items from 1.1.1 to 1.1.6.
DEDUCTIONS FROM CORE CAPITAL
1.1.8 Investments in subsidiary institutions and equity instruments of other banking
institutions
To prevent multiple use of the same capital resources in different banking institutions both
in Kenya and abroad, the institutions should deduct any investment in subsidiaries
conducting banking business and equity instruments of other banking institutions.
1.1.9 Goodwill
This is the difference between the value of the business as a whole and the aggregate of the
fair values of its separable net assets at the time of acquisition.
1.1.10 Deferred tax asset (DTAs)
These are DTAs relying on future profitability of the institution and must be deducted from
Tier 1 capital. DTA balance as at 31st December 2012 shall be recognised (not deducted)
but for a period not exceeding five years from that date. DTAs relating to temporary
differences such as allowance for credit losses can be recognized up to a limit of 10% of the
institution’s core capital. DTAs with deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) can be netted but only if
the DTAs and DTLS relate to taxes levied by same tax authority and offsetting is permitted
by that tax authority.
1.1.11 Other intangible assets
These are assets without loss absorption capacity on a going concern basis or without
physical existence e.g. patents, copyrights, formulae, trademarks and franchises. However,
computer software should not be deducted.

105

1.1.12 Total deductions
This is the total of all the items from 1.1.8 to 1.1.11.
1.1.13 Core Capital
Core Capital is the deduction of line 1.1.12 from line 1.1.7.
1.2 SUPPLEMENTARY CAPITAL (TIER 2)
1.2.1 Revaluation reserves
This is the revaluation reserves of land and buildings based on independent and
professional valuation as to the market value of such assets. The valuation should not be
more than 3 years. Only 25% of revaluation should be included after obtaining Central
Bank of Kenya’s approval. Revaluation surplus may be included in Tier II capital not more
than once in 5 years.
1.2.2 Cumulative irredeemable preference shares
These are irredeemable shares with standing claim on the company and the claim is carried
forward in event of it not being paid in the current year.
1.2.3 Convertible notes and similar capital investments
Convertible notes are instruments that evidence a company promise to pay a loan on
maturity, which can be converted, into shares any time before maturity date. Other similar
capital investments are convertible debentures, bonds, loans.
1.2.4 Perpetual subordinated debt
This is a debt equity or loan capital, which is not redeemable.
1.2.5 Limited life redeemable preference shares
These are preference shares with limited life of at least five years and are redeemable.
1.2.6 Term subordinated debt
This refers to loan capital, bonds, commercial paper or debt equity with original maturity
period of five years and above. Principal should be repayable after at least five (5) years.

106

1.2.7 Statutory Loan Loss Reserve
These are provisions that have been appropriated from retained earnings (revenue reserves).
This will only apply if provisions computed under Risk classification of Assets and
Provisioning Guideline is in excess of impairment losses computed under International
Financial Reporting Standards. However, loan loss reserve qualifying as supplementary

MARKET RISK RETURN COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS
Market Risk is a sum of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk.
1. Market Risk Summary Report
The total of market risk weighted assets equivalent is determined by summing the amounts
determined in:





total Interest Rate Risk (Form C1);
total Foreign Exchange Risk (Form C2);
total Commodity risk (Form C3); and
multiplying by the conversion factor of 12.5 to get the market risk weighted assets
equivalent.

2. Interest rate risk
All on and off balance sheet interest rate positions held in the trading book are subject to
this charge. The charge encompasses two calculations: one for specific risk and one for
general risk.
To calculate the general market risk capital charge, banks and financial institutions must
calculate separately their positions in shillings and each other currency that represents a
significant holding. In addition, other currencies that represent insignificant holdings are to
be combined into a single reporting schedule that has the same format as those for
individual currencies.

1.60% (residual term to maturity more than 24 months)

The Government category, which includes all forms of government paper (local and
foreign) including bonds, treasury bonds and other short term instruments, has zero risk
weight.
The Qualifying category attracts risk charges between 0.25% and 1.6% depending on the
residual term to maturity. This category includes securities issued by public sector entities
and multilateral development banks and other securities subject to supervisory authority that
are deemed to be of comparable investment quality by the reporting bank.
The Other category receives a specific risk charge of 8%. Both a short portion and a long
position in these securities is given the same 8% charge. This category will include nonqualifying corporate debt (i.e. debt issued by corporate entities that are internally classified
substandard, doubtful or loss) and any other interest rate related securities not covered in
other securities described above.
General Risk charges are designed to capture the market risk arising from a change in
interest rates on the entire trading book i.e. a general risk charge should be applied on all
the instruments on which specific risk charge would have been applied as described above.
Institutions are required to use the maturity methodology to calculate the general risks.
Maturity Method
In the maturity method long or short positions in debt securities and other sources of
interest rate exposures including derivative instruments are slotted into a maturity ladder
comprising thirteen time-bands as shown in Form C1 above and Table 2 below. When the
bank utilises the supplied spread sheet to calculate its market risk charges, the bank is
required to complete columns 1 through 4. The remainder of the calculations are
programmed for calculation by the spread sheet.

116

General Risk charges are calculated using the information in column 4 of form C1
multiplied by the risk weight depending on the time band and time zone as indicated in the
section showing ‚Key to Time Zones / Bands‛.
The first step in the calculation of general risk charges is to weight the positions (Form C1
column 4) in each time-band by a factor designed to reflect the price sensitivity of those
positions to assumed charges in interest rates. The factors (weights) for each time-band are
set out in Table 2 (also listed in column 12 of Form C1).

The next step is to get to produce a weighted long (i.e. column 7 of Form C1) or short
position (i.e. column 8 of Form C1) in each time band. The position for all time bands is
then aggregated to get the residual general risk.
Vertical disallowances within same time bands
In calculating the general risk charges, short positions are given negative signs and long
positions positive signs. This applies to the general risk charge of any short position in any
security, regardless of instrument or maturity. For this reason, disallowances of offsets are
introduced.
The first step in the calculation of disallowances is to produce two sets of weighted
positions, the net long and short positions in the each time-band. These amounts are entered
into columns 13 and 14 respectively for Form C1 above. The next step in the calculation is
117

to offset the matched positions in each time-band, resulting in a single short or long position
for each bands.
To determine the vertical disallowances within the same time-bands enter the smaller of the
short and long position in a time band, disregarding the sign, into column 15 as the matched
position. Since each band may include different instruments and different maturities, a 10%
capital charge will be levied on the smaller of the offsetting positions, be it long or short to
reflect basis risk and gap risk. This amount is entered into column 16 of Form C1.
The result of the above calculations is to produce weighted positions called the vertical
disallowances, which have no sign and are aggregated to give the total vertical
disallowance.
Horizontal Disallowances
In addition, institutions will be allowed to conduct two rounds of ‚horizontal offsetting‛,
first between the net positions in each of three time zones (zero to one year, one year to
four years and four years and over), and subsequently between the net positions in the three
different zones. The offsetting will be subject to a scale of disallowances expressed as a
fraction of the matched positions, as set out in Table 3.

Horizontal disallowances within same time zones
In column 17 of Form C1 enter the net unmatched positions in the time bands including the sign,
indicating whether it is a long and short position.
In column 18 Form C1 enter the matched position in each time zone. This is the smallest
exposure in the zone regardless of whether short or long position. Should the net unmatched
position in any time band for a particular time zone be zero, the corresponding matched position
for that time zone is consequently also zero.

118

Offsetting positions in each of three time zones attracts a disallowance factor that is part of the
capital charge (i.e. 40% for zone 1, 30% for zone 2 and 30% for zone 3), as shown in Table 3.
This is entered into column 19 Form C1. The total of the weighted horizontal offsets in column
19 gives total offsets within time zones. This represents the first horizontal disallowance.
Horizontal disallowances between time zones
The net unmatched positions in each time zone, is the residual net position, calculated by
summing together the net unmatched positions (Form C1 column 17) for all the time bands
associated with a particular time zone, and entering this amount into column 20. This amount
may be carried over and offset against opposite positions in other time zones, thereby subjecting
the unmatched time zone positions to a second set of disallowance factors.
Matched positions between time zones are calculated as the absolute value of the lower amount of
net unmatched positions (Form C1 column 20) between two time zones, and are reported in
column 21. Column 22 of Form C1 indicates the second horizontal disallowance. The matched
positions between zones 1 and 2, zones 2 and 3, zones 1 and 3 should be weighted with the
following factors 40%, 40% and 100% respectively, as indicated in Table 3. The total of the
weighted horizontal offsets in column 22 of Form C1 gives total offsets between time zones. This
represents the second horizontal disallowance.
Form C1 Column 23 holds the net unmatched position between all time zones, also known as the
residual net amount. It is weighted at 100% for capital. The residual net amount can be
calculated in three ways, all of which should produce the same result. The net unmatched
position is calculated as the net amount resulting from adding together the net unmatched
positions in the time bands (Form C1 column 17), with signs applied, or the net unmatched
positions in the time zones (Form C column 20), with signs applied. The same amount should
result from adding together all the weighted long positions and weighted short positions, as
reported in columns 7 and 8 of Form C1 prior to sorting them into time bands.
The general interest rate risk charge is the aggregate of the vertical offset, horizontal offsets and
the residual net amount.
THE TOTAL INTEREST RATE RISK CAPITAL CHARGE CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE FORM C1
IS INDICATED IN THE TABLE AS ‚TOTAL INTEREST RATE RISK CAPITAL CHARGE (SPECIFIC +
GENERAL)‛
2. Calculation of Foreign Exchange Risk Exposure.
The open position in a currency is the sum of the net spot positions and the net forward
positions.
119

(a) Net Spot Position
The net spot position is the difference between on-balance sheet foreign currency assets and
liabilities in each particular currency. This must also include all accrued income and
accrued expenses.
(b) Net Forward Position
The net forward position represents all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid in
the future in a particular currency as a result of foreign exchange transactions which have
already taken place. These are off-balance sheet transactions as indicated in the table C2
below.
i) All amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid in the future as a result of transactions
in currency futures, and also the principal on currency swaps, must be measured and included
in the net forward position.
ii) For each currency report any net future income or expense that is not yet accrued but has
already been fully hedged. Banks and financial institutions have discretion in whether to
report these positions; however they must be consistent in their treatment. The selection of
positions that are only beneficial to reducing the overall position will not be permitted.
iii) To be included in the calculation guarantees must be certain to be called and likely to be
unrecoverable.
iv) Other off-balance sheet items that represent either a profit or loss in foreign currency should
be recorded as other items.
(c) Calculating Overall Net Open FX Position using the Shorthand Method
Under the Shorthand method the overall net open position shall be arrived at as follows;
(i) Adding together all net short positions.
(ii) Adding together all long positions.
(iii) The Overall Net Open Position is the higher of (i) and (ii).
(d) Calculation of Capital Charge
The absolute value of the overall net open position in currencies is then added to the open
position in gold to get the overall net open position in currencies and gold. The total capital for
foreign exchange risk under the shorthand method is then obtained by multiplying the overall net
open position in currencies and gold by a factor equivalent to the required minimum capital
adequacy ratio for the overall net open position (10%).

(a) Commodities Risk Completion instructions (Form C3)
The return Form C3, on computation of a capital charge on commodities risk is to be completed
as follows:
(i) List the commodities in which the institution holds positions under column A of Form C3.
(ii) Convert the positions in each commodity at current spot rates into Kenya Shillings.
(iii) Determine the long and short positions in each commodity and enter the same into respective
columns B & C of Form C3.
Note: Institutions are only expected to complete the 3 steps above.
(b) Commodities Capital Charge Computation
(i) The capital charge for directional risk will be equal to 15% of the net position, long or short,
in each commodity.
(ii) In order to protect the bank against basis risk, interest rate risk and forward gap risk, the
capital charge for each commodity will be subject to an additional capital charge equivalent to
3% of the bank’s gross positions, long plus short, in that particular commodity. In valuing
the gross positions in commodity derivatives for this purpose, banks should use the current
spot price.
(iii) The total capital charge for commodities risk will be the sum of the charges obtained in (i)
and (ii) above for all the commodities.

FORM D: CAPITAL CHARGE CALCULATION FOR OPERATIONAL RISK USING
BASIC INDICATOR APPROACH
The capital charge for operational risk under BIA may be expressed as follows:
K = [(GI 1 + GI2 + GI3) X α ]/n, where,
K = capital charge under the Basic Indicator Approach
GI = only positive annual gross income over the previous three years (i.e. negative or zero
gross income if any shall be excluded),
α = 15%
n = number of the previous three years for which gross income is positive.
Gross income
Gross Income (GI) is defined as ‚Net interest income‛ plus ‚net non-interest
income‛. This measure should; a) be gross of any provisions (includes interest suspense)
b) be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers
c) exclude realized profits/losses from the sale of securities held to maturity in the banking
book.
d) exclude extraordinary or irregular items.

PRELIMINARY
Title
Guideline on Risk Classification of Assets, Provisioning and Limitation of Interest
on Non -Performing loans.

1.2

Authorisation
1.2.1 The Guideline is issued under Sections 33(4) and 44A of the Banking Act,
which empowers the Central Bank to issue guidelines, advise and direct
business of institutions for the general carrying out of the purposes and
provisions of the Banking Act (Cap.488).
1.2.2 Sections 20, 31 and 44A of the Banking Act place the following requirements
upon institutions:




1.3.

Section 20 requires institutions to maintain adequate provisions for bad
and doubtful debts prior to declaring profits or dividends.
Section 31 (3) (b) requires institutions to exchange information on nonperforming loans.
Section 44A limits the amount of interest institutions may recover on
non-performing loans.

Application
All institutions licensed under the Banking Act.

1.4.

Definitions
Terms used in this Guideline are as defined in the Banking Act and as further
defined below:
1.4.1 ‚interest owing‛ for purposes of section 44A (6) of the Banking Act, this
refers to the interest accrued in accordance with the contract between the
debtor and the institution but not paid by the date the requirements for the
limitation of interest recoverable on non-performing loans came into
operation.
126

1.4.2‚limitation of interest recoverable on non-performing loans’’ refers to the
restrictions imposed by section 44A of the Banking Act.
1.4.3 Loans and loans advances may be used inter-changeably to mean a financial
asset resulting from the delivery of cash or other assets by a lender to a
borrower in return for a promise to repay on a specified date or dates, or on
demand, usually with interest. Loans comprise business and personal lending,
overdrafts, credit card lending, Hire purchases, Residential and Commercial
Mortgage, Project Finance, finance lease and other financing arrangement that
are in substance loans.
1.4.4 Gross loan in a loan or group of loans is the face or principal amount, taking
into account payments applied to reduce principal, and adjusted to reflect
accrued but uncollected interest, charge-offs, unamortized premium or
discount (i.e., a difference between acquisition cost and principal) and
unamortized loan fees and costs.
1.4.5 Interest in Suspense is interest accrued on non-performing loans that is not
recognized as income in institution’s income statements.
1.4.6 Net Loan is gross loan less interest in suspense less provisions for loans
1.4.7 Impaired loan’ is a loan which has deteriorated in the credit quality such that
it is probable that the institution will be unable to collect, or there is no longer
reasonable assurance that the institution will collect, all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement(s).
1.4.8 ‚non-performing loans and advances‛ - for purposes of Sections 20, 31 and
44A of the Banking Act means:
1.4.8.1 In respect of loan accounts and other credit extensions having preestablished repayment programs, when any of the following
conditions exist:
 principal or interest is due and unpaid for 90 days or more; or
 interest payments for 90 days or more have been re-financed, or
rolled-over into a new loan.
1.4.8.2 In respect of current accounts (overdrafts) and other credit extensions
not having pre-established repayment programs, when any of the
following conditions exist:
127

 balance exceeds the customers approved limit for more than 90
consecutive days;
 the customers borrowing line has expired for more than 90 days;
 interest is due and unpaid for more than 90 days;
1.4.8.3 In respect of off balance sheet items, when the off balance sheet items
crystallizes and the customer’s account is debited and the principal
and interest is thereafter unpaid for 90 days or more.
1.4.9

Off balance sheet items‛ means an asset or a debt or a financing activity
that does not appear on the institution’s balance sheet. Such items include
guarantees, acceptances, performance bonds, letters of credit, and other off
balance sheet items deemed to constitute credit risk by the Central Bank of
Kenya.

1.4.10

‚Provisions for loan‛ or ‚allowance for loan‛ - is the amount that
reduces the gross loan in a loan or a group of loans to the carrying amount
on the balance sheet.
 Specific provision ’is a provision that is established against a loss that is
identified in an individual loan.
 General provision’ is a provision that is established for latent losses that
are known to exist, but cannot yet be ascribed to individual loans.

1.4.11

‚Other Provisions‛
Is provision other than provision for loans losses.

1.4.12

‚past due‛ or ‚overdue‛ - means any loan for which:



principal or interest is due and unpaid for more than 30 days; or
interest payments equal to more than 30 days interest have been
refinanced, or rolled-over.

Current accounts (overdrafts) and other credit extensions are considered
‚past due‛ when any of the conditions below exist:


balance exceeds the customers approved limit for more than 30
consecutive days;



the customers borrowing line has expired for more than 30 days;
128



interest is due and unpaid for more than 30 days; or



the account has been inactive or credits are inadequate to meet the
outstanding interest for more than 30 days.

The balance outstanding (not just the amount of delinquent payments) is used in
calculating the aggregate amount of ‚past due‛ loans.
1.4.13

‚Principal owing‛ ” for purposes of section 44A of the Banking Act, this
refers to the loan and advance that is still outstanding or unpaid excluding
interest accrued when the loan and advance becomes non-performing.

1.4.14 ‚Performing loans and advances’’ - for purposes of Sections 31 and 44A,
means loans and advances which are otherwise not defined as non
performing under this guideline.
1.4.15 Renegotiated loans and advances may be used interchangeably with
restructured loans and advances‛ to mean loans and advances where the
lender, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial
difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise
consider. Restructured troubled loans and advances are loans and advances
for which the lender has granted a concession to the borrower due to a
deterioration of the borrower’s financial condition. The restructuring may
include:
 A modification of terms, e.g., a reduction in the interest from that
originally agreed or a reduction in the principal amount.
 The transfer from the borrower to the bank of real estate, receivables
from third parties, other assets, or equity interest in the borrower in full
or partial satisfaction of the loan.
1.4.16 ‚Fully secured loan’’ means that a credit facility where collateral used to
secure the facility has a value that is sufficient to cover the carrying amount
of the loan. Such security is perfected in all respects and has no prior
encumbrances that could impair its value or otherwise prevent obtaining
clear title.
1.4.17 Grouping of accounts. Means loans and advances to related companies and
individuals are grouped together and recognized as a single borrowing in
completing returns under this guideline; loans to a company or individual
129

are to be grouped together with loans to their associated companies and
individuals. Associates are defined in Section 2 of the Banking Act.
1.4.18 Overdraft a loan which can be transacted without any specific repayment
schedule but has a limit and an expiry date for repayment.

PART II:
2.1

STATEMENT OF POLICY
Purpose
2.1.1 This guideline is intended to ensure that all assets are regularly evaluated
using an objective internal grading system which is consistent with this
guideline and that timely and adequate provisions and write offs are
made to the provisions account in order to accurately reflect the true and
fair financial condition of the institutions. It is also intended to encourage
institutions to develop effective workout plans for problematic assets in
accordance with this guideline.
2.1.2 This guideline is intended to ensure that institutions do not charge
interest that is more than the principal owing at the time the loan
becomes non-performing.

2.2

Scope
This guideline applies to all assets held or reflected in an institution’s books,
including off balance sheet items.

2.3

Responsibility
The Board of Directors of each institution shall be responsible for establishing:
2.3.1 an asset review system, which is consistent with this guideline,
which accurately identifies risk, assures the adequacy of the
provisions for non-performing assets, and properly reflects such
results in the financial statements of the institution.
2.3.2 a system to ensure that interest accrued on non- performing loans and
advances does not exceed the principal owing at the time the loan
becomes non performing.

130

In the exercise of its prerogatives as the highest policy making body
of the institution, the Board of Directors of every institution shall
prescribe in writing:

PART III:
3.1

a)

a credit policy specifying the criteria and procedures in the
evaluation, processing, approval, documentation, and
disbursement of credits. Such policy should include the
procedures for loan administration and recovery, the recording
of transactions and maintenance of appropriate credit and
document files. The levels of discretion given to approving
executive officers or committees must be defined in such credit
policy or in a separate resolution of the board of directors. The
credit policy should also outline circumstances and conditions
under which loans may be restructured.

b)

a system of reviewing the entire asset portfolio including
contingent accounts or off balance sheet items and adequate
provisioning for losses at periodic quarterly intervals. Such a
review system should be made part of the credit policy
mentioned.

c)

a system of review of each extension or renewal of credit,
identifying, and classifying troubled credits as weaknesses
become evident without waiting for the scheduled periodic
review. Such review system should likewise be made part of the
credit policy mentioned.

d)

a system for identifying loans and advances as when they
become non-performing and the outstanding balance at the time.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR LOANS AND ADVANCES

Loan Review
(a)

Objectives.
Each institution’s loan review function shall ensure that:


The lending function conforms to a sound and written lending policy
which has been adopted and approved by the board of directors;

131

(b)



Management and the board of directors are adequately informed
regarding portfolio risk;



Problem accounts are properly identified on a timely manner and
internally classified appropriately, in accordance with the classification
criteria as given in this guideline as a minimum;



Adequate level of provisions for potential loss are made and maintained at
all times;

Frequency and Reporting
The management of each institution shall ensure that a review of its loan
portfolio is made at least on a monthly basis. Such reports shall provide
sufficient information that will enable the board to deliberate and direct
management to take timely and necessary remedial action within a specified
time frame.

3.2

Classification of Loans
(a)

Criteria for Classification
In the determination of the classification for loans and advances, performance
will be the primary consideration. The performance will generally show the
repayment capability of the borrower. An institution could develop and
implement its own loan classification system based on internal risk rating
methodologies, however at minimum loans shall be classified into the five
categories using the criteria provided in this Guideline
Loans classified as sub-standard, doubtful and loss shall be considered as nonperforming loans (NPLs).






Normal
Watch
Sub-standard
Doubtful
Loss
Where an institution is using its own internal risk rating system there
should be a proper process to map the internal rating to classification
provided in this guideline.

132

(b)

Adverse Classification
A significant departure from the primary source of repayment may warrant
adverse classification even when a loan is current or is supported by an
underlying collateral value. Reclassification may also be warranted if a
delinquency has been technically cured by modification of terms, refinancing,
or additional advances.
In cases where different classification grades may be assigned based on
subjective criteria, the more severe classification should generally apply.
Moreover, nothing contained in the classification definitions below shall
preclude assigning a more severe grade when an analysis of a borrower’s
financial condition, ability, and willingness to repay justifies a more severe
classification.

(c)

Central Bank’s Classification
Upon completion of an on-site examination, the Central Bank of Kenya will
provide a list of reclassified accounts, some of which will be downgraded from
categories earlier classified by the institution. No account from this list will be
upgraded by the institution without sufficient justification.
It is a requirement that, before the quarterly and year-end accounts are
finalized and published, institutions take into account the provisions
recommended in the latest Central Bank inspection report. Where necessary,
tripartite meetings may be held between the institution, Central Bank of Kenya
and the external auditors.

3.3

Classification Categories
(a)

Normal
These are well-documented facilities granted to financially sound customers
where no weaknesses exist. All such loans must be performing in accordance
with the contractual terms and are expected to continue doing so. Loans in this
category are normally fully protected by the current sound net worth and
paying capacity of the borrower.
Performance
(i)

Term loans:
Up to date repayments;

133

(ii)

Overdrafts:
Operates within limit and receiving sufficient credits each month to cover
interest.

(iii) Bills Discounted
Bill not yet due
(iv) Off Balance Sheet items
Off balance sheet items that have not yet crystallised.
(b)

Watch
Loans in this category may be currently protected and may not be past due but
exhibit potential weaknesses which may, if not corrected, weaken the asset or
inadequately protect the institution’s position at some future date. Examples of
such weaknesses include, but are not limited to: inability to properly supervise
the debt due to an inadequate loan agreement; deteriorating condition or
control of collateral; deteriorating economic conditions or adverse trends in the
borrower’s financial position which may, if not checked, jeopardize repayment
capacity, risk potential is greater than when the loan was originally granted.
This category should not be used as a compromise between Normal and
Substandard.
Performance
(i)

Term Loans
These are loans, which display one or all of the following
characteristics:




Principal or interest is due and unpaid for 30 to 90 days
Interest payments are outstanding for 30 to 90 days or have
been refinanced, or rolled over.
For loans paid in installments:

Mode of payment
Monthly
Quarterly
Semi-annually
Annually

Installments in Arrears
Less than 3 months
1 (not paid within 3 months)
1 (not paid within 3 months)
1 (not paid within 3 months)

134

ii) Current accounts (overdrafts)
Current accounts (overdrafts) and other credit extensions are considered
‚Watch‛ when any of the conditions below exist:






overdraft exceeds the customers approved limit for more than 30 to 90
consecutive days.
the customer’s credit line has expired and has not been renewed for more
than 30 to 90 days from the date of expiry.
interest is due and unpaid for more than 30 to 90 days.
the account has been inactive for more than 30 to 90 days or credits are
inadequate to meet all the outstanding interest during the period.
the customer’s credit line has been extended administratively in line with
the institution’s documented policy for more than 90 days from the date of
expiry, on condition that, during the period of extension, it is performing as
per contract terms.

(iii) Bills Discounted
Overdue for more than 30 to 90 days.
(iv) Off Balance Sheet items
Off balance sheet items that have crystallised and remain unpaid for up to 90
days.
An off-balance sheet item is said to have crystallised after occurrence or nonoccurrence of anticipated events leading to existence of an asset or liability which
was previously uncertain.
(c)

Substandard
Loans in this category are not adequately protected by the current
sound net worth and paying capacity of the borrower. In essence, the
primary sources of repayment are not sufficient to service the debt and
the institution must look to secondary sources such as collateral, sale of
fixed assets, refinancing or additional capital injections for repayment.
Any loan, which is past due for more than 90 days but less than 180
days shall be classified as Substandard, at a minimum.

135

Performance
(i)

Term loan

Principal or interest is due and unpaid for more than 90 days to
180 days.

Interest payments for more than 90 days to 180 days have been
re-financed, or rolled-over into a new loan.

Principal or interest is due and unpaid for more than 90 days to
180 days.

For loans paid in installments: Mode of payment
Monthly
Quarterly
Semi-annually
Annually

(ii)

Installments in Arrears
Over 3 months to 6 months
2 (not paid within 3 months)
1 (not paid within 6 months)
1(not paid within 6 months)

Current accounts (overdrafts)
Current accounts (overdrafts) and other credit extensions are considered
‚Sub Standard‛ when any of the following conditions exist:





debt exceeds the customers approved limit for more than 90 days to
180 consecutive days.
the customer’s credit line has expired for more than 90 days to 180
days.
interest is due and unpaid for more than 90 days to 180 days.
the account has been inactive for more than 90 days to 180 days and
credits are insufficient to cover all the outstanding interest during the
period.

(iii) Bills Discounted
A bill discounted is considered substandard when the bill is overdue and
unpaid for over 90 days to 180 days.
(iv) Off Balance Sheet Items
Crystallised off balance sheet items that remain outstanding for over 90
days to 180 days.

136

(d)

Doubtful
Loans in this category have all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan
plus the added characteristic that the loan is not well secured. These
weaknesses make collection in full, on the basis of currently existing facts,
conditions, and value, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of
loss is high, but because of important and reasonably specific pending
mitigating factors, the actual amount of loss cannot be fully determined. If
pending events do not occur within 360 days and repayment must again be
deferred pending further developments, a loss classification is warranted upon
realization of securities held. A loan that is past due for more than 360 days
may however retain a ‚doubtful‛ classification if it is backed by realisable
security.
Performance
Any loan which is past due more than 180 days shall be classified as Doubtful
at a minimum:
(i)

Term loan
 Principal or interest is due and unpaid for over 180 days.
 For loans paid in installments: Mode of payment
Monthly
Quarterly
Semi-annually
Annually

Installments in Arrears
Over 6 months but less than 12 months
3 (not paid within 3 months)
2 (not paid within 3 months)
1(not paid within 9 months)

(ii)

Current accounts (overdrafts)
Current accounts (overdrafts) and other credit extensions are
considered ‚Doubtful‛ when any of the following conditions exist:
 Debt exceeds the customers approved limit for more than 180 days.
 The customer’s credit line has expired for more than 180 days.
 The account has been inactive for more than 180 days or credits are
inadequate to meet all the outstanding interest during the period.
 Interest is unpaid and due for more than 180 days.

(iii)

Bills Discounted
A bill discounted is considered doubtful when the bill is overdue for
more than 180 days but not more than 360 days.
137

(iv)

Off Balance Sheet items
Crystallised off balance sheet items that remain outstanding for over
180 days to 360 days.

Any loan, which is under doubtful category where the security has either been
sold or discounted to zero value, shall be classified as loss unless the debt is in
the process of being collected e.g. in due course or through legal action or any
other means expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to
current status.
(e)

Loss
Loans, which are considered uncollectible or of such little value that their
continuance recognition as bankable assets is not warranted shall be classified
Loss. Losses shall be taken in the period in which they are identified.
(i)

Term loan



Principal or interest is due and unpaid for over 360 days.
For loans paid in installments: -

Mode of payment
Monthly
Quarterly
Semi-annually
Annually
(ii)

Installments in Arrears
12 or more
4 or more
2 (not paid within 5 months)
1 (not paid within 11 months)

Current accounts (overdrafts)
Current accounts (overdrafts) and other credit extensions are
considered ‚Loss‛ when any of the following conditions exist:





(iii)

Debt exceeds the customers approved limit for more than 360 days.
The customer’s credit line has expired for more than 360 days.
The account has been inactive for more than 360 days or credits are
inadequate to meet all the outstanding interest during the period.
Interest is unpaid and due for more than 360 days.

Bills Discounted
A bill discounted is considered loss when the bill is overdue for more
than 360 days.
138

(iv)

Off Balance Sheet items
Crystallised off balance sheet items that remain outstanding for more
than 360 days.

(f)

Classification of Multiple facilities
If an institution has granted multiple facilities to a single borrower, and any
one of them is non-performing, then the institution shall evaluate every other
loan to that borrower and where necessary place such loans on non-performing
status. Provisions will be made against that facility to fairly state the bank’s
financial position. Apportionment of joint collateral should be prorated for
purposes of provisioning based on current exposure, unless the institution has
formulated an alternative acceptable allocation mechanism of the collateral
value to the individual non performing facility.

3.4

Re-classification of Non-Performing Loans and Advances
3.4.1 A facility in the Substandard category will normally continue to be
classified Substandard unless all past due principal and interest is repaid
in full, in which case it may be upgraded to ‘Watch’ classification.
3.4.2 A facility in the Doubtful category will normally continue to be
classified Doubtful unless all past due principal and interest is repaid in
full, in which case it may revert to ‘Watch’ classification.
A facility which meets the above condition and has been classified as
Watch may be reclassified Normal if a sustained record of
performance is maintained for a period of six (6) months.
No provisions for non-performing loans may be written back unless the
accounts have been upgraded strictly on the basis of the criteria under
clause 3.4.

3.5

Classification of Renegotiated Loans and advances
3.5.1 A renegotiated loan and advance in the normal and watch categories
will normally continue to be classified as normal or watch as the case
may be unless the loans have exhibited weaknesses which may weaken
the assets or inadequately protect the institution’s position at some
future date. Examples of such weaknesses include, but are not limited
to:
139

Inability to properly supervise the debt due to an inadequate loan
agreement.
a) Deteriorating condition or control of collateral.
b) Deteriorating economic conditions or adverse trends in the
borrower’s financial position which may, if not checked,
jeopardize repayment capacity, and
c) Risk potential is greater than when the loan was originally
granted.
For normal and watch loan categories to be renegotiated, the
customer must provide sufficient justification and evidence that
he/she has enough income to support the new repayment
schedule. In reviewing the terms and conditions of the facility, an
institution must guard against granting ‘evergreen’ facilities
which may be used as conduits to hide non-performing facilities.
3.5.2 A renegotiated loan and advance in the Substandard category will
normally continue to be classified substandard unless:
(i) all past due principal and interest is repaid in full at the time of
renegotiation, in which case it may revert to ‘Watch’ classification
or
(ii) a sustained record of performance under a realistic repayment
program has been maintained. A sustained record of performance
means that all principal and interest payments are made according to
the modified repayment schedule.
A renegotiated loan which meets condition (i) above may be
reclassified as Normal if a sustained record of performance is
maintained for six (6) months from the date of renegotiation.
A renegotiated loan in the Sub-standard category, which meets
condition (ii) above may be classified as ‘Watch’ if the sustained
record is maintained for at least six (6) months from the date of
renegotiated date.
It may however qualify for ‘Normal’ classification if the sustained
record is maintained for at least twelve (12) months from the
renegotiated date. If after a formal restructuring a loan deteriorates,
it must revert to a non-performing classification status and be
classified accordingly.
140

3.5.3 A renegotiated loan in the Doubtful category will normally continue to
be classified Doubtful unless:
(i)

all past due principal and interest is repaid in full at the time of
renegotiation, in which case it may revert to ‘Watch’
classification or

(ii)

a sustained record of performance under a realistic repayment
program has been maintained. A sustained record of
performance means that all principal and interest payments are
made according to the modified repayment schedule.

A renegotiated loan which meets condition (i) above may be
reclassified Normal if a sustained record of performance is
maintained for a period of six (6) months from the date of
renegotiation.
A renegotiated loan in the ‘Doubtful’ category, which meets
condition (ii) above can be classified as ‘Watch’ if the sustained
record of performance is maintained for at least twelve (12) months
from the date of renegotiation. It may however qualify for ‘Normal’
classification if the sustained record of performance is maintained for
at least eighteen (18) months from the renegotiated date. If after a
formal restructuring, a loan deteriorates it must revert to a nonperforming classification status and be classified accordingly.
3.6

Provisioning Requirements
(a)

Suspension of Interest

When a loan is classified to non-performing category, an institution should
either cease the accrual of interest or continue to accrue interest suspended in
accordance with the criteria set out in this guideline and should not be treated
as income. Interest in suspense shall be taken into account in the computation
of provisions for non-performing loans.
(b) Minimum provisioning allocations.
In determining the amount of potential loss in specific loans or in the
aggregate loan portfolio, all relevant factors shall be considered including, but
not limited to: historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions,
delinquency trends, the effectiveness of the institution’s lending policies and
141

collection procedures, and the timeliness and accuracy of its loan review
function.
The following minimum percentage amounts for provisioning are to be
maintained according to assigned classifications. Where reliable information
suggests that losses are likely to be more than these minimum amounts, larger
provisions shall be made.
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)

for loans classified ‚Normal‛ 1%
for loans classified ‚Watch‛ 3%
for loans classified ‚Substandard‛ 20%
for loans classified ‚Doubtful‛ 100%
for loans classified ‚Loss‛ 100%

In the case of the first two categories the above percentages shall be applied
against the gross balance of a loan regardless of whether the loan is analysed
individually or as part of a pool of loans. For nonperforming categories the
percentages will be applied to the net balances after deduction of realisable
value of security and interest in suspense.
(c) Accounting treatment for provisions for loan losses
If impairment charges computed under International Financial Reporting
Standard (IFRS) are lower than provisions required under this guideline, the
excess provisions shall be treated as an appropriation of retained earnings and
not expenses in determining profit and loss. Similarly any credits resulting
from the reduction of such amounts results in an increase in retained earnings
and are not included in the determination of profits or loss.
Where the impairment charges computed under IFRS are higher than
provisions required under this guideline, the impairment charges will be
considered adequate for purposes of this guideline.
3.7

Treatment of Collateral
(a) General
Classification ratings of loans do not depend on the amount or quality of
collateral pledged. Collateral is regarded as a secondary source of repayment,
and therefore is only used in assessing the amount of loan loss provision
required for non-performing loans. This is especially true where the validity,
value and ability to realize collateral is subject to significant doubt.
142

(b) Perfection of Securities
Where securities are obtained, they should be perfected in all respects,
namely:
 Duly charged and registered.
 Adequately insured.
 Valued by a registered valuer.
 Perfected in all other areas specified in the letter of offer.
(c)

Valuation of Securities
For the purpose of determining the value of security in accounts, security
should be valued by a registered valuer on a reasonable and regular
basis. This should be clearly stated in the institutions credit policy.
Examiners may discount the value of securities depending on the
prevailing circumstances of each case. If the Central Bank of Kenya
deems it necessary, it may require the institution to have a valuation
carried out by another valuer registered by the Institution of Surveyors of
Kenya, at the institution’s expense.
For the purpose of this guideline the value of chattels mortgage and
guarantees that are not supported by tangible assets and will not be
considered, while debentures will be considered at 50% of the realisable
market value based on the latest valuation or the book values as per the
latest audited financial statements. Examiners may discount the value of
securities further depending on the circumstances of each case.

(d) Discounting of Securities
For the non-performing loans, the discounted value of collaterals shall be
deducted from the loan balance before making provisions. The period
allowable for deductions of discounted value of collaterals shall be for a
maximum of five years from the period the loan becomes nonperforming. Institutions will be expected to progressively discount the
forced sale value of securities over the five-year period at a discount rate
of 20% p.a. However, for the purpose of reporting to Central Bank,
institutions will be required to discount their securities at a rate of 5%
every quarter. For purposes of discounting, the security value will be
based on the forced sale value when the loan becomes non-performing
and any future appreciation in value should not affect the discount
amount. For all forms of collaterals, the discounted value of securities
may be deducted if transferability of title is certain and an active market
143

exists. An ‚active market‛ means that a bona fide sale (willing
buyer/willing seller) can be achieved within a reasonable period. The
effective date for starting discounting of securities shall be the date on
which the underlying loan becoming non-performing.
3.8

Examiner’s review
The board of directors shall maintain adequate records supporting its
evaluation of potential loan losses and the entries made to ensure adequacy of
the provision for loan losses. Such records shall be available for examiners to
assess management’s loss estimation procedures, the reliability of the
information on which estimates are based, and the adequacy of the provision
for loan losses. If the provision for loan losses is determined to be inadequate,
adjusting entries will be required.

3.9

Write-Off of Loan/Advances
An institution should write off a loan or a portion of a loan from its balance
sheet when the institution loses control of the contractual rights over the loan
or when all or part of a loan is deemed uncollectible or there is no realistic
prospect of recovery. This normally evident at a stage wherea)

The institution loses control of the contractual rights that comprise the
loan or part of the loan as determined by a court of law.

b)

All forms of securities or collateral have been called, realized, but
proceeds failed to cover the entire facility outstanding.

c)

d)

The institution is not able to collect or there is no longer reasonable
assurance that the institution will collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the loan/advances agreement.
The borrower becomes bankrupt

e)

Where efforts to collect debt are abandoned for any other reason.

Write off of facilities classified as loss should be done within 180 days of their
being classified as loss if there are no recoveries within this period.
All credit policies should adequately detail the write-off procedures in order to
minimise potential abuse. The ultimate authority for approval of write-offs
rests with the board of directors and the memorandum accounts should be
periodically audited.
144

PART IV:

OTHER ASSETS
Apart from the loans and advances portfolio, institutions may have other assets
such as deposits with institutions under statutory management and liquidation,
investments in associates, subsidiaries and joint ventures and sundry debtors
which may be subject to loss or diminution in value. Institutions should
regularly review the other assets and make necessary provisions as need arises.
Provisions should be made where an actual loss of an asset occurs or when the
recoverable amount of the asset is less than it’s carrying value. Provisions so
made should not be lumped together with provisions for loans and advances on
the CBK BS (M) but should be included under other provisions.

PART V:

REQUIREMENTS ON LIMITATION OF INTEREST RECOVERABLE

time the loan last became non-performing.

5.4

The requirements of Section 44A shall not apply to limit any interest under a
court order accruing after the order is made.

PART I: PRELIMINARY
1.1

Title: Guideline on Liquidity Management

1.2

Authorization: This Guideline is issued under Section 33(4) of the Banking Act, which
empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue guidelines to be adhered to by institutions in
order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial system.

1.3

Application: This Guideline shall apply to all institutions licensed under the Banking Act
(Cap 488) to conduct business in Kenya.

1.4

Definitions:
 Liquidity: Is the ability of an institution to fund increase in assets and meet obligations as
they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses.


Short Term Liabilities: These are liabilities that have matured and those that are due to
mature within 91 days and have cash flow implications.



Deposits: For purposes of this Guideline, deposits are as defined under Section 2 of the
Banking Act



Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is the compilation of policies, procedures and action
plans for responding to severe disruptions to a bank’s ability to fund some or all of its
activities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
Other terms used in this Guideline are as defined in the Banking Act.

PART II: STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1 Purpose:
The purpose of this Guideline is to:





Ensure each institution maintains adequate level of liquidity to meet its obligations as they
fall due.
Provide guidance on compilation of liquidity returns.
Ensure accuracy and uniformity in the computation of the liquidity ratio in the banking
sector.
Guide institutions in the formulation of liquidity management strategies, policies,
procedures, management information systems, internal controls and contingency plans for
unexpected distress situations.

157

2.2

Scope: This Guideline applies to an institution’s compliance with statutory liquidity
requirements and management of liquidity.

2.3

Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the board of directors of each institution to
implement and maintain a liquidity management strategy and policies that are appropriate
for the operations of the institution to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its
obligations as they fall due. The strategy and policies should be communicated to
executive and senior management and all other appropriate staff members for execution.
Although the statutory prescribed minimum liquidity requirement is 20% of deposit
liabilities, matured and short term liabilities, liquidity requirements vary from institution
to institution depending on cash flow requirements. Each institution shall therefore
establish a robust liquidity risk management framework that ensures it maintains
sufficient liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets, to
withstand a range of stress events, including those involving the loss or impairment of
both unsecured and secured funding sources.

PART III: BACKGROUND
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that an institution is able to meet, in full, all
its obligations/commitments as they fall due. An institution is required to hold adequate liquid
assets to fund maturing claims for prudent business management. It is therefore important for
management to not only measure liquidity on an on-going basis, but also to examine ways of
how to fund liquidity requirements during distress situations.

PART IV: SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Minimum Liquidity Ratio: Under section 19 of the Banking Act, an institution shall
maintain such minimum holding of liquid assets as the Central Bank may from time to time
determine. Currently an institution is required to maintain a statutory minimum of twenty
per cent (20%) of all its deposit liabilities, matured and short term liabilities in liquid assets.
4.2 Liquidity Management: In addition to complying with the minimum statutory requirements
under section 19 of the Banking Act, the management of an institution should put in place
mechanisms that will flag out potential funding problems in order to explore ways and
means of raising additional funds of the right type and amount. Liquidity Management
should, as a minimum, address the following:
4.2.1 Liquidity Management Strategy
This is a brief statement of an institution’s longer term approach to liquidity, including
management of its liquidity and maturity mismatch positions. This should be consistent
with the institution’s business lines and size of balance sheet.
158

4.2.2 Management Structure and Information Systems
An institution should have an adequate information system for measuring, monitoring,
controlling and reporting liquidity requirements. This system should be integrated in
the overall management information systems of the institution.
To supplement the management information system, an institution should have an
appropriate management reporting structure to effectively execute the liquidity
strategy, with the use of appropriate policies and procedures.
4.2.3 Measuring and Monitoring Net Funding Requirements:
An institution should have a process of assessing cash inflows against its outflows to
identify the potential for any shortfall. This should incorporate funding requirements
for both on and off-balance sheet items and in major foreign currencies traded by the
institution both in terms of aggregate foreign currency needs and for each currency
individually. Assumptions made in making cash flow projections should be clear and
documented. They should be subject to frequent reviews to determine the validity of
underlying factors. Less frequent, but more in-depth reviews should be carried out to
re-examine and refine institution’s liquidity policies and practices in the light of its
experience and developments in its business and economic environments.
In order to effectively monitor its liquidity risk, an institution is supposed to establish
an Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) with the following roles:
(i) management of the overall liquidity of the institution;
(ii) the ALCO must report directly to the Board or in the case of a foreign
incorporated bank, to senior management of the institution in the country;
(iii) the ALCO must facilitate, coordinate, communicate and control balance sheet
planning with regards to risks inherent in managing liquidity and convergences in
interest rates; and
(iv) the ALCO is responsible for ensuring that a bank’s operations lies within the
parameters set by its Board of Directors. However, the ALCO is not responsible
for formulating the in-house liquidity risk management policy.
In determining the composition, size and various roles of the ALCO, the Board is
required to consider the size of the institution, the risks inherent in the institution’s
operations and the organizational complexity.
4.2.4 Contingency Funding Plan (CFP)
An institution should have a formal Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) that clearly sets
out the strategies for addressing liquidity shortfalls in emergency situations. A CFP
should outline policies to manage a range of stress environments, establish clear lines of
responsibility, include clear invocation and escalation procedures and be regularly
tested and updated to ensure that it is operationally robust.
159

The plan should be commensurate with a bank’s complexity, risk profile, scope of
operations and role in the financial systems in which the bank operates. It should
articulate available potential contingency funding sources and the amount of funds an
institution estimates can be derived from these sources; clear escalation/prioritization
procedures detailing when and how each of the actions can and should be activated; and
the lead time needed to tap additional funds from each of the contingency sources.
CFPs should be reviewed and tested regularly to ensure their effectiveness and
operational feasibility and should be consistent with institution’s business continuity
plans.
4.2.5 Liquidity Stress Tests
An institution should conduct stress tests on a regular basis for a variety of short-term
and protracted institution-specific and market-wide stress scenarios (individually and in
combination) to identify sources of potential liquidity strain and to ensure that current
exposures remain in accordance with a bank’s established liquidity requirement. An
institution should use stress test outcomes to adjust its liquidity management strategies,
policies, and positions and to develop effective contingency plans.
4.2.6 Foreign Currency Liquidity Management
Each institution should have a measurement, monitoring and control system for its
liquidity positions in major currencies traded; both in terms of aggregate foreign
currency needs and for each currency individually.

4.2.7 Internal Controls for Liquidity Management
An institution should have an adequate system of internal controls over its liquidity
management process. There should be regular, independent reviews and evaluations of
the effectiveness of the system.
The internal control system for liquidity should be integrated with the overall system
of internal control and it should promote effective and efficient operations, reliable
financial and regulatory reporting, and compliance with applicable laws, regulatory
requirements and institution’s own policies.
PART V: RETURNS AND COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS
An institution shall provide data on its liquidity in the prescribed format (Form CBK/PR5-2
{Liquidity statement}) and in accordance with the completion instructions attached, after each ten
(10) working days period. The data should be submitted within five (5) working days after the
reporting date.
In addition to the liquidity ratio data, an institution shall provide data on maturity analysis of its
assets and liabilities in the prescribed format (Form CBK/PR5-1 {Maturity Analysis of Assets
160

and Liabilities}) on monthly basis and in accordance with the completion instructions attached.
The return should be submitted by the 10th day of the subsequent month.
Maturity analysis of off-balance sheet items that have cash flow implications should also be
analyzed in this return. The maturity time band will depend on the management judgment of
when the commitments will be likely to be called or drawn down.
PART VI: REMEDIAL MEASURES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS
6.1 Remedial Measures
6.1.1 If an institution fails to comply with the provisions of section 19 of the Banking Act, the
Central Bank of Kenya shall take action as per Banking Circular No. 14 of 2000 and
Legal Notice No. 77 of 10th June, 1999.
6.1.2 If an institution is unable to fund its liquidity mismatch, it shall forthwith, in writing,
report its inability to the Central Bank of Kenya, Bank Supervision Department, stating
reasons for such failure and/or inability, and measures being taken to rectify the situation.
6.1.3 Institutions submitting late and/or inaccurate returns shall be penalized and officers held
accountable and liable in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Act and CBK
Prudential Guidelines.
6.2 Administrative Sanctions
The conditions to be given shall generally cover management and control of liquidity exposures,
and conduct of the concerned institution’s business, but may specifically include the following:
6.2.1 Imposition of penalties under relevant sections of the Banking Act.
6.2.2 Suspension of lending activities and undertaking any new business.
6.2.3 Suspension from taking new deposits to retire maturing ones.
6.2.4 Recommending suspension from clearing house.

1.1.

Title - Guideline on Foreign Exchange Exposure Limits

1.2.

empowers the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to issue guidelines to be adhered to by
institutions in order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial system.

1.3.

Purpose - This Guideline is intended to ensure that the potential risk of loss arising from
foreign exchange rate fluctuations to a bank’s capital base is within prudential limits.

1.4.

Definitions

sum of all its assets and liabilities inclusive of all its spot, same day value and
forward transactions and its off balance sheet items in that foreign currency.
f) Overall foreign currency risk exposure means the sum of all net balance and offbalance sheet assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, expressed as a
domestic currency equivalent amount at the spot mid-rate using the shorthand method
of measurement.
g) Shorthand method means the procedure for measuring the foreign exchange risk
exposure by:
a. adding separately all short positions on one side and all long positions on the
other side;
b. comparing the two totals; and
c. taking the larger of the two totals as the open position.
h) ‚Same day transaction‛ or ‚same day purchase‛ or ‚same day-buy‛ or ‚same
day-sale‛ means a transaction having same day value.
i) ‚Same day value‛ means the transaction to which it is referred is to be executed on

m) ‚Value date‛ of a transaction means the date on which it is to be executed.

PART II: IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
2.1.

Limit on ‘overall’ foreign exchange risk exposure

180

The overall foreign exchange risk exposure as measured using spot mid-rates and
shorthand method shall not exceed 10% of the institution’s core capital.
2.2

Limit on ‚Single‛ currency foreign exchange risk exposure
The foreign exchange risk exposure in any single currency, irrespective of short or long
position, will be determined by the individual institution provided it remains within the
overall exposure limit of 10% of its core capital.

2.3.

Limit on ‚intra-day‛ foreign exchange risk exposure.
Intra-day foreign exchange risk exposures, both in single currencies and overall, shall be
maintained within prudent limits as established by a bank’s board of directors in a written
policy covering foreign exchange risk exposure.
Calculation of foreign exchange risk exposure
Each bank shall calculate its single currency and overall foreign exchange risk exposure
daily using the methodology required by CBK.

2.4.

2.5.

Correction of excess foreign exchange risk exposures
Each bank shall take every reasonable action to immediately correct any and all foreign
exchange risk exposures which exceed the limits set forth in this guideline and in its
board-adopted policy. Failure to correct any non-complying risk exposure by the closure
of business on the following day may result in administrative sanctions as set forth in this
guideline.

2.6.

Maintenance of supporting documentation
Each bank shall maintain records which are sufficient to determine at all times its single
currency and overall foreign exchange risk exposures. Each bank shall also maintain a
daily record showing close-of-business foreign exchange risk exposures (both single
currencies and overall) and a reconciliation of opening-to-closing positions.

2.7

Market Manipulation
In order to sustain the integrity of the financial exchange market, all institutions must
avoid engaging in speculative foreign exchange transactions that tend to mislead the other
participants in the market and must also avoid misuse of any privileged information. To
the greatest extent possible, all foreign exchange transactions should be supported by the
underlying commercial activity.
Market manipulation practices include insider dealing and deliberate attempts to interfere
with the market’s free and fair operations, which include but are not limited to:

Carrying out two or more concurrent or succeeding foreign exchange deals or
transactions that has, or is likely to have, the effect of altering or maintaining the
ruling exchange rate with the intention of influencing the decision of others to either
participate in a deal or otherwise.
181





Making a false or misleading impression of active forex trading through any of the
available communication channels.
Carrying out forex deals that do not involve an exchange of consideration or making
fictitious deals that influence the ruling exchange rate or forex flows.
Any other conduct that unduly influences the ruling exchange rate or forex flows.

PART III: CALCULATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK EXPOSURE
3.1.

Calculation of Exposure on Net Open Position in a Single Currency
The measurement of an institution’s exposure in a single currency involves determining if
the financial institution has a long or short open position in that particular currency, and
how large this position is. The open position in a currency is the sum of the net spot
position and the net forward position. These are explained below as follows:
(a)

Net Spot Position

The spot position is simply the position which appears directly on the balance
sheet. The net spot position is the difference between foreign currency assets and
liabilities in a particular currency. This must also include all accrued income and
accrued expenses.
(b)

Net Forward Position
The net forward position represents all amounts to be received less all amounts to
be paid in the future in a particular currency as a result of foreign exchange
transactions which have already taken place. These transactions which are
recorded as off-balance sheet items would include:
(i)

Spot transactions which are not yet settled.

(ii)

Forward foreign exchange transactions.

(iii) Documentary credits, guarantees and similar commitments denominated in
foreign currencies which are certain to be called upon and are likely to be
irrevocable. In case of guarantees, this will arise after notice has been
received by the bank.
(iv) Currency futures and Swaps
All amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid in the future as a result of
transactions in currency futures, and also the principal on currency swaps, must
be measured and included in the net forward position.
182

3.2.

Calculations of Overall Foreign Exchange Risk Exposure
This involves measurement of risks inherent in an institution’s mix of long and short
positions in different currencies. Institutions will adopt the ‚shorthand method‛ for
calculating the overall foreign exchange risk exposure or overall open position as
follows:
a)
b)
c)

Calculate the net open position in each currency (as above).
Arrive at the sum of all net short positions.
Arrive at the sum of all net long positions.

Overall foreign exchange risk exposure or overall open position is the higher of (b) or
(c).
PART IV: REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS
4.1.

General Instructions
Institutions will complete on a daily basis, a return in the attached format (CBK/PR/6)
and submit to the Central Bank by mid-day of the following day. The amounts reported
will be the foreign currency amounts recorded in the reporting banking institution’s books
as at the close of business at the end of each day, adjusted where necessary for
transactions not posted as at the reporting date.
Structural positions, i.e. foreign currency capital assets and liabilities such as investments
in subsidiaries, premises, loan capital, e.t.c, that are of a fixed long-term nature, may be
recorded by way of foot-notes to the return rather than in the body of the return.
Specified foreign currency details will be given in the return for those currencies with a
total long or a total short position. Other unspecified currencies may be combined and
reported in the row - ‚Others‛ of the return.
Amounts reported for each foreign currency, including forward transactions, will be
translated into Kenya shillings (Kshs) at the midpoint of the indicative spot TT buying
and selling exchange rates. The exchange rates to be used will be CBK Mean rates
issued daily by the Central Bank of Kenya. The exchange rates used will be recorded in
the row designated ‚Exchange Rate‛, on the return.
Forward foreign exchange rates are different from the spot rates and take into account the
respective levels of interest rates. Nevertheless, the exposures will be measured by using
the above-mentioned spot indicative exchange rates and not the forward rates.

4.2

Completion and Submission of Daily Return
183

Notes on completion and submission of the daily return are annexed to this guideline.

PART V: CORRECTIVE MEASURES
5.1.

Remedial Measures
If a bank fails to comply with this guideline in a manner that results, or threatens to
result, in an unsafe or unsound condition, CBK may pursue any or all corrective actions
as provided under section 33 and 34 of the Banking Act. However, before the sanctions
are administered, the bank will be given opportunity to defend itself.

5.2.

Administrative sanctions
In addition to the use of corrective actions noted in 5.1 above, the Central Bank of Kenya
may prohibit the non-compliant institution from engaging in any further foreign exchange
activities or impose any sanctions deemed necessary.

5.3.

Penalties for Violation of Guidelines
Monetary penalties will be levied for violations of this guideline, as provided for in the
Banking Act vide Legal Notice No.77 of 1999 under the Banking (Penalties) Regulations,
1999.

PART VI: EFFECTIVE DATE
6.1

Effective Date - The effective date of this guideline shall be 1st January 2013.

6.2

Supersedence - This Guideline supersedes and replaces the Prudential Guideline on
Foreign Exchange Exposure Limits, CBK/PG/06 issued by CBK on 1st January 2006 and
the Banking Circular No.12 of 2011 dated 17th October 2011.

reported.
2.1

Undelivered Spot Purchases
Foreign exchange deals are generally settled two business days after they are
made. During these two days the amount of the purchased currency to be received
is recorded as off-balance sheet amounts. Undelivered spot transactions refer to
all outstanding spot contracts written but not delivered.

2.2

Forward Purchases
187

A forward purchase is defined as one contracted for receipt beyond two business
days from the reporting date. Forward purchases refer to the gross amounts of
outstanding forwards, other than those to be delivered ‚spot‛.
2.3

3.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Items
This refers to items that involve foreign currency exposures not covered in the
above categories such as options and swaps. If material, details should be given
by way of footnotes.

Total Foreign Assets
This is the sum of lines 1.1.1 to 2.3

4.

Foreign Currency Liabilities
This refers to foreign currency liabilities recorded in the reporting banking institution’s
books.
4.1

188

recorded as off-balance sheet amounts. Undelivered spot transactions refer to all
outstanding spot contracts written but not delivered.

6.

5.2

Forward Sales
A forward sale is defined as one contracted for delivery beyond two business days
from the reporting date. Forward sales refer to the gross amounts of outstanding
forwards, other than those to be delivered ‚spot‛.

5.3

Other Off-Balance Sheet Items
This refers to items that involve foreign currency exposures which are not
covered above such as options and swaps. If material, details should be given by
way of footnotes.

Total Foreign Liabilities
This is the sum of 4.1.1 to 5.3

7.

Net Open Positions
This is calculated by subtracting Total Foreign Currency Liabilities (line 6) from Total
Foreign Currency Assets (line 3) for each currency. A positive result indicates an
overbought position (+) and should be indicated in Row 7.1 while a negative position (-)
indicates an oversold position and should be indicated in Row 7.2. Whether the position
is negative or positive, it is still an exposure. Therefore do not use negative or positive
signs on rows 7.1 or 7.2. The entry for other currencies (‚Others‛), which are not
individually specified should be divided to show the total for those currencies with net
long positions and the total for those with net short positions separately.

8.

Single currency Risk Exposure
8.1

Net Open Position as a percentage of core capital
This is calculated dividing the long or short position for each currency (line 7.1 or
7.2) by the core capital and multiplying by 100.

9.

Overall Foreign Exchange Risk Exposure
9.1

Exposure (Overall)
This is the higher of (a) the sum of all net long positions in line 7.1 or (b) the sum
of all net short positions recorded in line 7.2.

9.2

Core Capital
Core capital is as defined in the Banking Act and as reported in the latest
submitted PR 3.
189

9.3

Exposure as percentage of Core Capital
This is arrived at dividing line 9.1 by 9.2 and multiplying by 100.

9.4

Allowable Exposure
The allowable limit is 10% of core capital of the institution. The limit is on the
overall foreign exchange risk exposure for all currencies combined.

9.5

Over Exposure/Under Exposure
This is arrived at subtracting line 9.4 from line 9.3. Over-exposure means actual
exposure is greater than the allowable exposure and the institution should address
this matter. Under exposure means actual exposure is less than the allowable
exposure and the institution need not address the matter.

9.6

Submission of Daily Returns
The daily returns in the format given in Form CBK/PR/6 duly signed by the
reporting bank’s authorized officials must be submitted to the Bank Supervision
Department of the Central Bank of Kenya on a daily basis by mid-day of the
following day.

Single Borrower Limits (Banking Act Section 10)

3.1.1 An institution shall not grant to any person or permit to be outstanding any advance, credit
facility or give any financial guarantee or incur any other liability on behalf of any person,
so that the total value of the advances, credit facilities, financial guarantees and other
liabilities in respect of that person at any time exceeds 25% of its core capital.

a)

Sub-section 11(1)(e) of the Banking Act prohibits institutions from granting or from
permitting to be outstanding any advance or credit facility to any of its directors or other
person participating in the general management of the institution unless such advance, loan

times (500%) of the institution’s core capital.

3.4. Restrictions on Trading and Investments (Banking Act Section 12)
3.4.1 The bulk of funds held by an institution constitute depositors’ funds. For this reason, it
would be imprudent for an institution that has been licensed to carry on banking, financial
or mortgage finance business to venture into trading, or investments that may be risky
thereby jeopardizing depositors’ funds. The Banking Act therefore prohibits an institution
from:
a)

Engaging alone or with others in wholesale or retail trade in the course of satisfaction
of a debt due to it.

b)

Acquiring or holding, directly or indirectly any part of the share capital of, or
otherwise have a beneficial interest in any financial, commercial, agricultural,

exceed in the aggregate 25% of the institution’s core capital.
This provision is not applicable where:

c)

(i)

such an undertaking is in satisfaction of a debt due. Such interests have to be
disposed of within such time as the Central Bank may allow.

(ii)

the shareholding is in a corporation established for the purpose of promoting
development in Kenya and such shareholding has been approved by the
Minister.

Purchasing or acquiring or holding any land or any interest or right therein except as
reasonably necessary for the purpose of conducting its business or holding or
providing amenities for staff not exceeding prescribed limits. These conditions are
subject to limits prescribed by the Central Bank of Kenya from time to time.
Currently the prescribed limit for land and buildings is restricted to 20% of an
institution’s core capital. Acquiring and developing land should therefore be strictly
within the specified limit. The institution is however, not prevented from:
i)

Letting part of any building, which it uses for conducting its business.

ii)

Securing a debt on land and, in the event of default in payment of the debt,
holding the land for so long as in the opinion of the Central Bank is needed for
its realization or,

iii)

Acquiring land for the purpose of its own development.

3.5. Restrictions on Ownership of Share Capital of an Institution (Banking Act Section 13)

indirect share-holding of an institution has been restricted to a maximum of 25% to any
one person other than:

d)

another institution,
the government of Kenya, or the Government of a foreign sovereign state,
a state corporation within the meaning of the State Corporations Act, or,
a foreign company, which is licensed to carry on the business of an institution in its
country of incorporation.

3.5.2 No financial institution or mortgage finance company shall acquire or hold, directly or
indirectly any part of the share capital of, or otherwise have beneficial interest in any
bank.

nominee, corporate body or company.
3.5.4 A shareholder shall not transfer more than five percent of an institution’s share capital to
an individual or an entity except with the prior written approval of the Central Bank.
3.6

Restrictions on making advances for Purchase of Land (Banking Act Section 14)

3.6.1 An institution is restricted from making advances or loans for the purchase, improvement
or alteration of land so that the aggregate is in excess of 40% of the amount of its total
deposit liabilities unless it is a mortgage finance company.
3.6.2 The Central Bank may however, authorize an institution to exceed the limit up to a
maximum of 70%.
3.6.3 These provisions, shall however, not prevent an institution from accepting security over
land for a loan or an advance made in good faith for any other purpose.
3.7

Imposition of charges and payment of interest (Banking Act Section 16A)

3.7.1 No institution shall impose any form of charges on a savings, seven day call or fixed
deposits account.
3.7.2 An institution shall, in respect of a saving account, pay interest accruing, or a return in the
case of an institution carrying out business in accordance with Islamic law, to that account
as long as the minimum balance is maintained.
3.7.3 An institution shall, in respect of a seven day call or fixed deposit account, pay interest
accruing to the account on agreed contractual terms.
3.7.4 The interest in 3.7.2 or 3.7.3 may be forfeited if the deposit is uplifted before the maturity
date.
3.8

The maximum amount shall be the sum of the following:
a)
b)
c)

the principal owing when the loan becomes non-performing;

exceeding the principal owing when the loan becomes non-performing; and,
expenses incurred in the recovery of any amounts owed by the debtor.

advances and other assets have been made in accordance with the Banking Act.

1.2

Application - All institutions licensed under the Banking Act (Cap.488) and their
foreign branches and subsidiaries.

1.3

Authorisation - This Guideline is issued under section 33(4) of the Banking Act,
which empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue Guidelines to be adhered to by

1.4

Definition ” ‚Money laundering‛ means the act of a person who:
(i)
engages, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that involves proceeds of any
unlawful activity;
(ii)
acquires, receives, possesses, disguises, transfers, converts, exchanges,
carries, disposes, uses, removes from or brings into Kenya proceeds of any
unlawful activity; or
(iii)
conceals, disguises or impedes the establishment of the true nature, origin,
location, movement, deposition, title of, rights with respect to, or ownership
of, proceeds of any unlawful activity where ”
a)

as may be inferred from objective factual circumstances, the person
knows or has reason to believe, that the property is proceeds from
any unlawful activity, or

b)

in respect of the conduct of a natural person, the person without
reasonable excuse fails to take reasonable steps to ascertain whether
or not the property is proceeds from any unlawful activity.

‚person‛ means any natural or legal entity.
‚proceeds of crime‛ proceeds of crime‛ means any property or economic
advantage derived or realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of or in connection
with an offence irrespective of the identity of the offender and includes, on a
proportional basis, property into which any property derived or realized directly
204

from the offence was later successively converted, transformed or intermingled, as
well as income, capital or other economic gains derived or realized from such
property from the time the offence was committed;
A ‚business relationship‛ is any arrangement between the institution and a
customer the purpose of which is to facilitate the carrying out of transactions
between the parties on a frequent, habitual or regular basis, and where the monetary
value of dealings in the course of the arrangement is not known or capable of being
ascertained at the outset. The opening of an account with an institution should
therefore be treated as forming a ‘business relationship’.
A ‚correspondent banking relationship‛ is an arrangement where one bank, the
(‚correspondent bank‛) provides banking services to another bank (the ‚respondent
bank‛). Respondent banks may be provided with a wide range of services, including
cash management, interest-bearing accounts in a variety of currencies, international
wire transfers, cheque clearing, payable-through accounts and foreign exchange
services.
A ‚one off transaction‛ means any transaction carried out other than in the course
of a business relationship. For example, a single foreign currency transaction for a
customer who does not have an account at the concerned institution constitutes a one
off transaction.
‚Competent Authorities‛ means (i) the home authority that should be involved for
the understanding of group policies and controls at group-level and (ii) the host
authorities that should be involved for the branches/subsidiaries.
‚Know your customer‛ requirements consist of obtaining full particulars of the
customer’s identity (which may need to be verified in certain circumstances) and a
sound knowledge of the purpose for which the customer is seeking to establish a
business relationship with an institution. This knowledge needs to be applied to all
dealings initiated by the customer. The extent to which such dealings appear not to
‘fit’ this knowledge base will become the basis of an institution’s suspicion about the
customer which should then be reported to the Central Bank in accordance with the
provisions of the Guideline.
Other terms used within this Guideline are as defined in the Banking Act.
PART II:
2.1

STATEMENT OF POLICY

Purpose - The purpose of this Guideline is to provide guidance regarding the
prevention, detection and the control of possible money laundering activities and
terrorism financing.
205

2.2

Scope - This Guideline shall apply to all institutions licensed to transact business
under the Banking Act. It highlights methods of prudent customer identification,
record keeping, identification of suspicious activities and the need to report such
activities to the appropriate authority for further investigation.
2.2.1 This Guideline is also applicable to the foreign branches and subsidiaries of
institutions licensed to transact business under the Banking Act.

2.3

Responsibility - It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and management of
an institution to establish appropriate policies on anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) procedures and to train staff to
ensure adequate identification of customers, source of funds and the use of the said
funds. Such policies should also ensure the effective prevention, detection and
control of possible money laundering and terrorism financing.

PART III:
3.1

BACKGROUND

What is Money Laundering?
Money laundering is the process by which criminals attempt to conceal the illegal
origin and illegitimate ownership of property and assets that are the fruits or
proceeds of their criminal activities. If undertaken successfully, it also allows the
criminals to present the proceeds of their crime as having originated from legitimate
source thereby allowing them to maintain control over those proceeds and to dispose
of them without hindrance, which ultimately is the goal of crime committed for
profit.
Money laundering is a global phenomenon that affects all countries to varying
degrees. By its very nature, it is a hidden activity. However, failure to prevent the
laundering of the proceeds of crime permits criminals to benefit from their actions.
3.1.1

Money Laundering Predicate Offence
Money laundering predicate offence is the underlying criminal activity that
generates proceeds, which when laundered, results in the offense of money
laundering. Examples of predicate offences include human trafficking,
robbery, fraud, corruption, bribery, insider trading and counterfeiting of
goods.

206

3.1.2

The Need to Combat Money Laundering
There is growing recognition that it is essential for criminals to be
prevented, whenever possible, from legitimizing the proceeds of their
criminal activities by converting their ‚dirty‛ funds to ‚clean‛ funds.
The ability to launder the proceeds of criminal activity through the financial
system is vital to the success of criminal operations. If they are to benefit
from the proceeds of their activities, those involved need to exploit the
facilities of the world’s financial sector businesses, which includes facilities
in the country.
The long term success of any of the world’s financial sectors depends on
attracting and retaining legitimately earned funds. Criminally earned money
is invariably transient in nature. It damages reputation and deters honest
investments. Institutions that become involved in money laundering risk
prosecution, the loss of their good market reputation, and damaging the
reputation of the country as a safe and reliable financial jurisdiction.

3.1.3

Stages of Money Laundering
Despite the variety of methods employed, the laundering process is
accomplished in three stages. These stages, described below, may comprise
numerous transactions by the launderers that could alert an institution of the
criminal activity.
(a) Placement ” the physical disposal of the initial proceeds derived from
illegal activity.
(b) Layering ” separating illicit proceeds from their source by creating
complex layers of financial transactions designed to disguise the audit
trail and provide anonymity.
(c) Integration ” the provision of apparent legitimacy to criminally derived
wealth. If the layering process has succeeded, an
integration scheme
places the laundered proceeds back into the economy in such a way that
they re-enter the financial system appearing as normal business funds.

The three basic steps may occur as separate and distinct phases. Alternatively, they
may occur simultaneously or, more commonly, they may overlap. How the basic
steps are used depends on the available laundering mechanisms and the requirements
of the criminal organizations.

207

3.1.4 Vulnerabilities
Certain points of vulnerability have been identified in the laundering process
which the money launderer finds difficult to avoid and where his activities
are therefore more susceptible to being recognized, specifically: These are:
• entry of cash into the financial system;
• cross-border flows of cash; and
• transfers within and from the financial system.
3.2

What is Terrorism Financing?
Terrorism financing is when a person by any means, directly or indirectly,
unlawfully and willfully provides or collects funds with the intention that these funds
will be used in full or in part to carry out a terrorist act by a terrorist organization or
be linked to specific terrorist acts.
Terrorism financing not only poses a threat to the security of the country, but also
can have a damaging impact on the stability, efficiency and transparency of the
financial system. It poses a long term threat to development of the economy, by
diverting money from productive uses to unproductive uses, while damaging the
reputation of a country.
The main difference between money laundering and terrorism financing is that
terrorism financing may come from legitimate sources as well as illegitimate
sources. In contrast, money laundering only involves proceeds originating from
illegitimate sources.
3.2.1 The United Nations International Convention for the Suppression
of the Financing of Terrorism
Kenya is a signatory to the United Nations International Convention for the
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999). The Convention defines a
terrorist act as an ‚act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian,
or any other person taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed
conflict when the purpose such act by its nature or context is to intimidate a
population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to
abstain from doing any act‛.
This convention is the most comprehensive international instrument for combating
the financing of terrorism. It specifies various international treaties that deal with
the different types of terrorist activities. The offences set out in all the said treaties
are among the crimes that must be considered acts of terrorism.
208

3.2.2 The United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee
The United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee was established on 15
October 1999 by the Security Council with the adoption of the Resolution
1267 for the purpose of overseeing the implementation of sanctions measures
imposed on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan for its support of Osama bin
Laden. The sanctions regime has been modified and strengthened by
subsequent resolutions, to cover more than a dozen additional United Nations
Security Council Resolutions so that the sanctions measures apply to
designated individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida wherever
located.
On 17 June 2011, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolutions
1988 (2011) and 1989 (2011) as successor resolutions to resolution 1904
(2009). By adopting these resolutions, the Security Council split the Al-Qaida
and Taliban sanctions regime. Resolution 1989 (2011) stipulates that the
sanctions list maintained by the Security Council Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) will henceforth be known as the ‚AlQaida Sanctions List‛ and include only names of those individuals, groups,
undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida. The Security Council will
review the current sanctions December 2012.
The cornerstone of the regime is a consolidated list of persons maintained by
the Security Council. All nations are obliged to freeze bank accounts and
other financial instruments controlled by, or used for the benefit of, anyone
on the list.
3.2.3 1267 Return
Institutions shall be required to put in place internal control measures which
ensure the detection of persons and/or entities that have been designated by
the UN Security Council 1267 Committee by accessing the UN website:
(http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/committees/1267/1267ListEng.htm). Institutions
shall further be required to submit the 1267 Return CBK/IF 9 (Refer to
Appendix I) on a quarterly basis verifying that the persons or entities
designated by the UN Security Council Committee form part of their
customer database.

209

3.3

Proliferation Financing
Proliferation financing refers to the act of providing funds or financial services
which are used, wholly or partially for the manufacture, acquisition, possession,
development, export, shipment, brokering, transport, transfer, stockpiling or use of
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery and related
materials in contravention of national laws or, where applicable, international
obligations.
In the recent past, proliferation financing has emerged as a common global security
threat. It facilitates the movement and development of proliferation-sensitive items
and can contribute to global instability and potentially catastrophic loss of life if
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are developed and deployed.
3.3.1 Vulnerabilities
Kenya is geographically located in close proximity to countries that are sources of
the raw minerals that are key to development of weapons of mass destruction.
Nairobi also serves as the financial hub for the East and Central Africa Region
which may on occasion facilitate the sale and purchase of these raw minerals.

3.4

International Standard Setters
3.4.1 The United Nations
The United Nations (UN) was the first international organization to undertake
significant action to fight money laundering on a global basis. The UN has the
ability to adopt international treaties or conventions that have the effect of law in a
country once that country has signed, ratified and implemented the convention,
depending upon the country’s constitution and legal structure. In certain cases, the
UN Security Council has the authority to bind all member countries through a
Security Council Resolution, regardless of other action on the part of an individual
country.
The international effort to fight money laundering can only addressed effectively
using a multinational law. Kenya is a signatory to several of the United Nation
Conventions that aim to combat money laundering, terrorism financing and
proliferation financing including:
i. The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs
and Psychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention)

210

ii.

iii.

iv.

The International Convention against Transnational Organized Crime
(the Palermo Convention) requires member countries to criminalize money
laundering and all the predicate offences of money laundering and establish
regulatory and supervisory regimes to detect all forms of money laundering.
The International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism which UN member countries to criminalize terrorism, terrorist
organizations and terrorist acts.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 and 1267 which oblige
all UN member countries to criminalize actions relating to the financing of
terrorism and requires member states to freeze the assets of the Taliban.

3.4.2 The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body
which sets standards and develops and promotes policies to combat money
laundering and terrorist financing and proliferation. FATF assesses member
compliance with those standards, promotes global compliance with the
standards, and identifies AML/CFT threats.
About 180 jurisdictions across the globe have directly endorsed the FATF
recommendations. Kenya is a member of the Eastern and Southern Africa
Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) which is one of the FATF
Associate Members.

Compliance by Foreign Branches and Subsidiaries
Foreign branches and subsidiaries of institutions licensed pursuant to the
Banking Act should endeavor to comply with this Guideline and where there is
conflict between the Guideline and the regulatory requirements of the host country,
the more stringent requirement should be adopted to the extent that is permitted by
the host country’s laws and regulations.
5.2.1 Institutions should pay special attention to foreign branches or
subsidiaries
operating
in
countries
which
have
insufficiently
implemented the internationally accepted AML/CFT measures.
5.2.2 In the event that, an institution’s foreign branch or subsidiary is unable to
observe the more stringent requirements, due to the prohibition of
the
host country’s laws and regulations, the foreign branch or subsidiary should
issue an exception report to the institution and the institution should inform
the Central Bank of Kenya accordingly. In addition, the institution should
place additional AML/CFT controls on the respective foreign branch or
subsidiary and should map out a timeline for the foreign branch or subsidiary
to comply with the requirements.

5.3

The Anti-Money Laundering Program
Institutions should put in place effective anti-money laundering programs that
address the risks posed by money laundering and terrorism financing. It should
enhance the ability of the institution to identify, monitor, and deter persons from
attempting to gain access to, or make use of the financial system.
5.3.1 The program should be documented and should establish clear responsibilities
and accountabilities to ensure that policies, procedures and controls are
introduced and maintained.

214

5.3.2 The program should amongst others address the following issues:

5.4

a)

Internal policies, procedures, and controls instituted that are based
on the institution’s money laundering and terrorism financing risk
assessment.

b)

Designate an AML Compliance Officer and detail the role he /she
will play in the day-to-day AML/CFT supervision of the institution.

5.4.1 Procedures and responsibilities for monitoring compliance with and
effectiveness of anti-money laundering policies and procedures should be
clearly laid down by institutions in the form of policy documents and internal
procedural manuals.
5.4.2 Institutions should appoint a Compliance Officer to undertake this function
and the officer should have the necessary authority to carry out the function.
a)
The Compliance officer will be the central point of contact with
the Central Bank for anti-money laundering purposes.
b) The institutions should provide the Compliance Officer with the
necessary access to systems and records to enable the Officer fulfill his
responsibilities.
5.4.3 The functions of the Compliance Officer shall be to amongst others:
a) receive and vet suspicious activity reports from staff;
b) file suspicious transaction reports with the Financial Reporting
Centre(FRC);
c) develop the institution’s anti money laundering compliance programme;

b) Avoid and disclose conflicts of interest;
c) Maintain good credit ratings;
d) Adhere to policies on rotation of duties and mandatory vacations; and
e) Require the use of employee identification cards for access to secure
areas;
5.5

Risk Assessment
Institutions shall undertake a Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Risk
Assessment. The Assessment should provide the means for identifying the degree of
potential money laundering and financing of terrorism risks associated with specific
customers and transactions thereby allowing the institution to focus on customers
and transactions that potentially pose a greater risk of money laundering and
terrorism financing. In addition the risk assessment should enable institutions to
assess, monitor, manage and mitigate the risks associated with money laundering.
The risk assessment conducted by institutions should enable that institution adopt a
risk based approach towards managing and mitigating risks related to anti-money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. Institutions are advised to undertake
enhanced measures to manage and mitigate AML/CFT risks where higher risks are
identified; correspondingly, where risks are lower, simplified measures may be
permitted. Simplified measures may however not be undertaken whenever there is a
suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing.
Institutions should take into consideration the findings of the country’s National
Money Laundering and Terrorism Risk Assessment.
5.5.1

When preparing a risk assessment, an institution should consider factors such
as:
a) The number and volume of transactions per customer,
b) Nature of the customer relationships, and
216

c)

Whether, for example, the institution’s interaction with customers is
face-to-face or non-face-to-face such as electronic banking (for
example, internet banking, and mobile banking).

5.5.2 The development of an AML risk assessment framework involves three
steps:
a) Identifying and assessing the money laundering and terrorism financing
risks that may be associated with the institution’s unique combination of
products and services, customers, geographic locations and delivery
channels.

b)

Conducting a detailed analysis of all available data to assess the level of
risk within each high risk category; and,

c)

Determining whether the institution’s AML compliance program is
adequate and provides the necessary controls to mitigate the risks
identified.

5.5.3 Institutions should update their risk assessment policies/programs at least
every two years in order to take into account changes such as the entry of the
institution into new markets and the introduction of new products and
services.
5.5.4 Risk Categories
In undertaking a Risk Assessment, institutions shall amongst others take into account
the following categories.
a)

Country Risk

Institutions should identify domestic and international geographic locations that may
pose a higher risk to its AML/CFT compliance program. Each case should be
evaluated individually when assessing the risks associated with doing business, such
as opening accounts or facilitating transactions, in certain geographic locations.
Factors that may result in a country or region posing a higher risk include:
(i)

Countries that are subject to sanctions, embargoes or similar measures issued
by credible organizations such as the United Nations (‚UN‛), the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF).

217

(ii)

Countries identified by credible sources as lacking appropriate AML/CFT
laws, regulations and other measures.

(iii)

Countries identified by credible sources as providing funding or support for
terrorist activities or that have designated terrorist organisations operating
within them.

b)

Products/Services Risk

Institutions should consider the potential money laundering and terrorism financing
risks associated with each specific product or service prior to its introduction to the
market. This risk assessment should be forwarded to CBK for review and
consideration prior to the introductions to the market. Special attention should be
paid to the risks associated with new or innovative products or services not
specifically being offered by the institution, but which make use of the institution’s
services to deliver the product. Such products or sources could include:
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)
vi)
vii)
viii)
ix)
x)
xi)
xii)
xiii)
xiv)

c)

Electronic funds payment services:
Electronic cash such as stored value cards or
Domestic and international funds transfers, payable upon proper
identification (PUPID) transactions, and third-party payment processors;
Remittance activity;
Automated clearing house (ACH) transactions;
Automated teller machines (ATMs);
Mobile Phone Financial Services;
Electronic banking;
Foreign exchange and funds transfers;
Domestic and international private banking;
Trust and asset management services;
Monetary instruments;
Foreign correspondent accounts, payable through accounts (PTAs) and
foreign currency denominated accounts; and
Lending activities, particularly loans secured by cash collateral and
marketable securities.
Customers/Entities Risk

An institution shall determine, based on its own criteria, whether a particular
customer poses a higher risk. Certain customers and entities may pose specific risks
depending on the nature of the business, the occupation of the customer, or the
nature of anticipated transaction activity. Some factors to consider include:
218

a)

Customers conducting their business relationship or transactions in unusual
circumstances, such as:
(i)

Significant and unexplained geographic distance between the institution
and the location of the customer;

(ii)

Frequent and unexplained movement of accounts to different
institutions; and;

(iii) Frequent and unexplained movement of funds between institutions in
various geographic locations.
b)

Customers whose structure or nature of the entity or relationship makes it
difficult to identify the true owner or controlling interests.

c)

Foreign financial institutions, including banks and foreign money service
providers such as forex bureaus, and money transmitters.

d)

Non-bank financial institutions such as money services businesses, casinos
and brokers/dealers in securities, and dealers in precious metals, stones, real
estate dealers.

e)

Publicly exposed persons (PEPs). Individuals who are or have been entrusted
with prominent public functions (both foreign or local), for example, senior
politicians, senior government officials, judicial or military officials, senior
executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials.
Business relationships with family members or close associates of PEPs may
involve reputational risks similar to those with PEPs.

f)

Resident and Non- resident aliens (NRAs) and accounts held by foreign
individuals.

g)

Foreign corporations and domestic business entities, particularly offshore
corporations such as domestic shell companies, private investment companies
and international business corporations located in high-risk geographic
locations.

h)

Cash-intensive businesses, including, for example, supermarkets,
convenience stores, restaurants, retail stores, liquor stores, wholesale
distributors

219

i)

Foreign and domestic non-governmental organizations and charities.

j)

Professional service providers.

The weight assigned to each of these risk categories (individually or in combination)
in assessing the overall risk of potential money laundering may vary from one
institution to another, depending on their respective circumstances. Consequently,
an institution will have to make its own determination as to the risk weights to
assign to the different risk.
5.5.5 Conducting a detailed analysis of all available data
The second step of the risk assessment process entails a detailed analysis of the data
obtained during the identification stage in order to assess the AML Risk. This stage
involves obtaining quantitative data pertaining to the institution’s activities, different
weights are assigned to each product/service, customer/entity and geographical
based on the following:
•
•
•

The institution’s ability to identify the customer.
Number and volume of transactions.
Past history

The weight assigned to each of these risk categories (individually or in combination)
in assessing the overall risk of potential money laundering may vary from one
institution to another, depending on their respective circumstances. Consequently,
institutions will have to make their own determination as to the risk weights to
assign to the different types of risk.

Customer Due Diligence
5.6.1 Know your Customer Requirements
The need for institutions to know their customers is vital for the prevention of
money laundering and underpins all other activities.
220

When a business relationship is being established, the nature of the business that the
customer expects to conduct with the institution should be ascertained at the outset
to show what might be expected as normal activity. In order to be able to judge
whether a transaction is or is not suspicious, institutions need to have a clear
understanding of the legitimate business of their customers.
5.6.2 Customer Identification and Verification
In all circumstances, any business entity operating within the financial sector
requires basic information on its customers. The nature and extent of this
information will vary according to the type of business. It shall also depend on
whether the business is being introduced by a financial intermediary and the type of
customer involved.
An institution should establish to its satisfaction that it is dealing with a person that
actually exists. It should identify those persons who are empowered to undertake the
transactions, whether on their own behalf or on behalf of others.
When a business relationship is being established, the nature of business that the
customer expects to conduct with the institution concerned should be ascertained, so
as to determine what might be expected as the customer’s normal activity levels. In
order to judge whether a transaction is or is not suspicious, an institution needs to
have a clear understanding of the pattern of its customer’s business as its
relationship.
5.6.3 When Identity Must Be Verified
An institution must identity its customer in the following circumstances:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

When establishing initial business relations.
When undertaking occasional or one-off transactions.
When there is cause to be suspicious.
When there is doubt about veracity or adequacy of previously obtained
customer information.

5.6.4 Anonymous Accounts and Numbered Accounts
No institution shall open and/or maintain anonymous accounts or accounts in
fictitious names. All numbered accounts should undergo the same identification
and verification process as regular accounts.

221

5.6.5 Customer Due Diligence Measures
Customer Due Diligence (CDD) measures are to be undertaken by institutions with
the following objectives:
a)
b)

c)
d)

To identify the customer and verify that customer’s identity using
reliable, independent source documents, data or information.
To identify the beneficial owner, and take reasonable measures to verify the
identity of the beneficial owner, such that the institution is satisfied that it
knows who the beneficial owner is. Enhanced due diligence measures shall
be applied to persons and entities that present a higher risk to the institution.
For legal persons and arrangements, institutions are required to understand
the ownership and control structure of the customer.
Understand and, as appropriate, obtain information on the purpose and
intended nature of the business relationship.
Conduct on going due diligence on the business relationship and scrutiny of
transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure
that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s
knowledge of the customer, their business and risk profile, including where
necessary the source of funds.

5.6.5.1 Face to Face Customers
a)

For personal accounts or transactions:

An institution shall take measures to satisfy itself as to the true identity
of any applicant seeking to enter into a business relationship with it, or
to carry out a transaction or series of transactions with it, by requiring
the applicant to produce an official record for the purposes of establishing
the true identity of the applicant. At a minimum the mandatory requirements;
(i)

In the case of an individual:

A birth certificate; or

Passport; or

National identity card; or

Drivers licence

Additional due diligence measures that may be used to verify the
identity of the customer include:
a)

Address of current residence verified by a referee, a utility bill i.e.
electricity or water bill, etc.;
222

Trustees of Occupational Pension Schemes

For the Trustees of Occupational Pension Schemes, satisfactory verification of
identity can be based on the inspection of formal documents concerning the Trust
which confirm the names of the current Trustees and their addresses for
correspondence. Verification can also be based on extracts from Public Registers, or
references from Professional Advisors or Investment Managers. Individual
verification of each Trustee would not normally be required.
5.6.6 Enhanced Customer Due Diligence Measures
Enhanced due diligence measures shall be applied to persons and entities that present
a higher risk to the institution. This can broadly be addressed with the following
measures:

Obtain further information to establish the customer's identity.

Apply extra measures to check documents supplied by a credit of
financial institution.

Obtain senior management approval for the new business relationship or
transaction.

Establish the persons/entity’s source of funds.

Carry out ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.

5.6.7 Non Face-To-Face Verification
5.6.7.1 Telephone mobile and Internet Banking
The rapid growth in telephone, mobile and internet banking has added a
new dimension to banking risks including the verification of identity,
unlicensed deposit taking and tax evasion and opens up new mechanisms
for fraud and money laundering because its use is unregulated. Any
mechanism which avoids face-to-face contact between an institution and the
customer inevitably poses challenges for customer identification and can
provide additional opportunities for criminals to gain access to the banking
system.
225

5.6.7.2

Any bank offering telephone banking, mobile banking and /or internet
banking should implement procedures to identify and authenticate the
customer and should ensure that there is sufficient communication to
confirm address and personal identity in accordance with the details set out
in paragraphs 5.6.7.3 to 5.6.7.8 below.

5.6.7.3 The procedures adopted should confirm the identity as robustly as those for
face-to-face verification and reasonable steps should be taken to avoid
single or multiple fictitious applications or substitution (impersonation)
fraud for the purpose of money laundering.
5.6.7.4 As with face-to-face verification, the procedures to check identity
must serve two purposes:
o
They must ensure that a person bearing the name of the applicant
exists and lives at the address provided; and
o
That the applicant is that person.
5.6.7.5

There are a number of checks and measures which, when undertaken
successfully, will give the institution a reasonable degree of assurance as to
the authenticity of the applicant where there is no face-to-face contact.
Some of the more widely used checks are listed below in paragraphs
5.6.7.7 and 5.6.7.8. The list of checks is not definitive and it is for each
institution to decide upon which checks to employ. Institutions should
assess the money laundering risk posed by the postal, telephone and mobile
banking products they offer and devise their verification of identity
procedures with due regard to that risk.

5.6.7.6 For all accounts and products offering third party transfer and money
transmission facilities, evidence of personal identity and address
verification should be undertaken through a combination of checks,
examples of which are set out below in paragraph 5.6.7.7 and 5.6.7.8 For
non-transferable investment products of accounts, where the money
invested can only be returned to the original investor, the procedures set
out in the paragraphs below can be followed, although further verification
checks will need to be undertaken if the customer migrates to another
account or product that provides money transmission facilities and
therefore constitutes a higher money laundering risk.
5.6.7.7 Some of the best means of verifying address are:

226

Requesting sight of a recent utility bill, local authority tax bill, institution
statement (to guard against forged or counterfeit documents, care should be
taken to check that the documents offered are originals); or checking a
local telephone directory (for businesses).
5.6.7.8 In addition, satisfactory evidence of personal identity can be obtained by a
number of means, some of which are set out below:

Use of a computerised system, for internal or external application
database checks, to check for any inconsistencies in the information
provided ” particularly those containing known fictitious application/
fraud information (accommodation, addresses, aliases, etc.);

Telephone contact with the applicant on an independently verified
home or business number;

With the customer’s consent, employer’s personnel department
confirms employment by verbal confirmation on a listed number; or

Salaries details appearing on recent bank statements;

Care should be taken to ensure that the same supporting
documentation is obtained from Internet customers as for other
postal/telephone/mobile banking customers;

Institutions should consider regular monitoring of accounts opened on
the Internet. Unusual transactions should be investigated and reported
if found to be suspicious.
5.6.8 Wire Transfers
5.6.8.1 Institutions should ensure that information accompanying both domestic and
cross-border wire transfers should always contain the
following information:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

the name of the originator;
the originator account number where such an account is used to
process the transaction;
the originator’s address, or national identity number, or date and
place of birth;
the name of the beneficiary; and
the beneficiary account number where such an account is used to
process the transaction.
In the absence of an account number, a unique transaction reference
number should be included which makes it possible to trace the
transaction.

227

5.6.8.2 The requirements in 5.6.8.1 apply to institutions in circumstances
where the institution is acting as:
a)

The ordering financial institution; This is where the institution
initiates the wire transfer and transfers the funds upon receiving the
request for a wire transfer from the customer.

b)

The beneficiary financial institution; This is where the institution
receives the wire transfer from the ordering institution directly or
through an intermediary institution and makes the funds available to
the beneficiary identified by the sender as the receiver of the
requested wire transfer.

5.6.8.3 Wire transfers to and from persons or entities that are designated under the
United Nations Security Council 1267 (1999) and/or other United Nations
resolutions relating to the prevention of terrorism and terrorist financing
are prohibited.
5.6.9 Reliance on Third Parties
Institutions may rely on third parties to perform elements of CDD measures set out
in part 5.6.5.1 to 5.6.7 of this Guideline, provided that they meet the criteria set out
below.
The term third parties means other financial institutions or designated non-financial
businesses or persons (DNFBPs) that are supervised or monitored by competent
authorities.
It should be noted that where reliance on third parties to perform elements of CDD
measures is permitted, the ultimate responsibility for CDD measures remains with
the institution that is relying on the third party.
a)

An institution relying on a third party should immediately obtain the
necessary information concerning the relevant elements of CDD measures set
out in 5.6.5.1 to 5.6.7 of this Guideline.

b)

Institutions should take adequate steps to satisfy themselves that copies of
identification data and other relevant documentation relating to the CDD
requirements will be made available from the third party upon request
without delay.

228

c)

Each institution should ensure that that the third party is regulated,
supervised or monitored by a competent authority and has measures in place
for compliance with, CDD and record-keeping requirements in line with
international best practice.

d)

There are instances where an institution may be relying on a third party that
is based out of Kenya in another country. The institution should assess the
AML/CFT risks that the country poses and the adequacy of CDD measures
adopted by financial institutions in that country.

5.6.10 Where an institution is unable to fully comply with the customer due
diligence requirements set out in this Guideline, it :
a)
b)
c)
5.7

Should not open the account, commence the business relation or perform or
undertake the transaction; or,
In the event where the institution has already commenced the business
relationship terminate the business relationship; and,
File a suspicious transaction report in accordance with this Guideline.

Non Kenyan Residents
For prospective non Kenyan resident customers who wish to open accounts without
face-to-face contact, it will not be practical to seek sight of a passport or national
identity card. There are a number of alternative measures that can be taken:
“

5.8

Branches, subsidiaries, head offices, representative offices or correspondent
banks in the prospective customer’s home country may be used to confirm
identity or as an agent to check personal verification and address details;

“

Where the institution has no group presence or correspondent relationship in
the country of residence, a copy of the passport authenticated by an attorney,
notary or consulate could be obtained; or

“

An account opening reference can be sought from a reputable credit or
financial institution in the applicant’s home country. Verification details
should be requested covering true name or names used, current permanent
address, date of birth and verification of signature.

Legitimacy of Funds and Transactions
The following types of information will be considered the minimum acceptable for
determining the legitimacy of funds and transactions:
229

5.8.1 For large, frequent or unusual cash deposits or withdrawals - written
statement from the customer confirming that the nature of his/her business
activities normally and reasonably generates substantial amounts of cash;
5.8.2 For large, frequent or unusual currency exchanges - written statement from
the customer confirming the reason and need for acquired currencies;
5.8.3 For multiple or nominee accounts, or similar or related transactions - written
statement from the customer confirming the reason and need for multiple or
nominee accounts, or similar or related transactions;
5.8.4 For large, frequent or unusual transfers or payments of funds - appropriate
documentation as to the identity of the recipient (or sender) of the transferred
or paid funds, and the reason underlying the transfer or payment;
5.8.5 For large or unusual investments or requests for advice or services - written
statement from the customer confirming that the investments or advice or
services being requested are bona fide and consistent with the goals and
objectives of the customer’s reasonable and normal business activities;
5.8.6 For large or unusual foreign transactions - written confirmation from the
customer indicating the nature, reason and appropriate details of the foreign
transactions sufficient to determine the legitimacy of such transactions.
5.8.7 Institutions should set up policies setting limits on the maximum cash
transaction amounts non-customers can undertake with them.
5.9 Politically Exposed Person (PEPs)
A Politically Exposed Person means a person who has been entrusted with a
prominent public function in (i) Kenya and (ii) a foreign country, and include;

In the event that that a customer subsequently becomes a Politically Exposed Person
after having initially established a relationship with a financial institution, the
institution is to carry out steps a) to c) above immediately it is made aware that a
customer is a Politically Exposed Person.

PART 1: PRELIMINARY
1.1

Title ” Guideline on Appointment, Duties and Responsibilities of External Auditors.

1.2

Authorisation - This guideline is issued under Section 33(4) of the Banking Act, which
empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue guidelines to be adhered to by institutions in
order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial system.

1.3

Application ” All institutions licensed under the Banking Act (Cap.488).

1.4

Definition ” The terms ‘external auditor’ or ‘Auditor’ means a registered public accounting
firm. These terms are used interchangeably.
Other terms used within this Guideline are as defined in the Banking Act.

PART II: STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1

Introduction - This guideline sets out minimum requirements regarding the appointment,
duties and responsibilities of external auditors of institutions. While the preparation and
integrity of financial statements are the responsibility of the board and senior management of
commercial banks, assurance of a properly conducted audit serves to provide an independent
view of the financial statements’ reliability. Such assurance would depend significantly on the
exercise of appropriate due diligence by commercial banks in the selection and engagement
of auditors.

2.2

effectively. Every institution shall advise its registered accounting public firm to use this
guideline in conjunction with Sections 24, 25 and 26 of the Banking Act.
 Ensure that external auditors of institutions have acceptable standards of competence and
independence;
 Enforce international best practices in carrying out audits of institutions;
 Assist in promoting confidence in the financial system by ensuring that qualified auditors
are appointed by institutions to audit and report on their operations and financial
statements;
 Promote transparency and accuracy in reporting by institutions to enhance market
discipline; and
243



Safeguard depositors' funds by requiring institutions to be subjected to effective external
audits.

Scope - This guideline applies to the appointment, duties and responsibilities of a registered
public accounting firm.

2.4

Responsibility ” It is the responsibility of the board of directors to ensure that the
institution’s shareholders appoint a registered public accounting firm annually in accordance

institution’s external auditors are given right to access at all times the institution’s books of
accounts, computer systems, vouchers, financial records, securities and all other relevant
records in order to facilitate their work.

affairs and exercise self- regulation.

2.2

Responsibility - The board of directors of each institution shall be responsible for the
adherence and compliance with the provisions of this guideline. This is consistent with the
board of directors’ responsibility to ensure that the financial statements are drawn up so as to
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and of the results of the institution.

PART III: SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Institutions should present a statement of financial position that groups assets and liabilities by
nature, listed in an order that reflects the relative liquidity of the groups of assets and
liabilities. Similarly, a statement of comprehensive income should reflect income and expenses
grouped by nature, quantifying the principal types of income and expenses.
3.2 Audited Financial Statements and Other Disclosures - All institutions licensed and operating
in Kenya shall be required, within three months of the end of every financial year, to publish
in a newspaper of nationwide circulation, between Mondays and Fridays excluding public
holidays, a copy of their audited statement of financial position showing its assets and
liabilities, statement of comprehensive income covering its activities and any other information
prescribed by Central Bank of Kenya. The financial statements and other disclosures so
254

published must fully conform to the format prescribed by the Central Bank of Kenya from time
to time.
All the audited financial statements and other disclosures to be published should first be
submitted to the Central Bank of Kenya for clearance at least two weeks before publication.
The financial statements must be signed by the Chief Executive Officer and at least one director
of the institution. The reports forwarded to the Central Bank of Kenya for clearance must
provide detailed reconciliations for any differences between them and the CBK (BSM), PR4-1,

financial statements and other disclosures are available on their website, together with the address of

3.5 Qualitative Disclosures
Public disclosure of reliable and timely information by banks enable users of that information to
make an accurate assessment of a bank’s financial condition and performance, business activities,
risk profile and risk management practices. However, disclosure alone does not necessarily result in
transparency. To achieve transparency, a bank must provide timely, accurate, relevant and sufficient
disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information that enables users to make proper assessment
of the institution’s activities and risk profile.
At minimum the following broad categories of information should be disclosed in clear terms and
appropriate detail to help achieve a satisfactory level of bank transparency. These are:

risks);
aggregate exposure to related parties and transactions with related parties;
all material entities in the group structure;
accounting policies; and
basic business, management and corporate governance information.

The scope and content of information provided and the level of disaggregation and detail should be
commensurate with the size and nature of a bank’s operations.
Where information on any of the above categories is not part of the published disclosures,
institutions are required to prepare and update the disclosures on a quarterly basis, forward to CBK
for clearance together with the disclosures for quarterly publication and upload them in their
websites on the same link as the published disclosures for reference by interested parties.

1.1

Title: Guideline on Enforcement of Banking Laws and Regulations

1.2

Authorisation - This Guideline is issued under section 33(4) of the Banking Act, which
empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue guidelines to be adhered to by institutions
in order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial system.

1.3

Purpose - This Guideline is intended to provide information and guidance to the banking
industry on the approach the Central Bank will take in issuing prompt supervisory
directives and corrective orders to institutions. Supervisory enforcement actions,
contained herein have attempted to set forth the banking practices, conditions, and
violations of law giving rise to the particular problems or weaknesses identified,
ordinarily through on-site examinations. Supervisory enforcement actions are also to be
used to provide an outline of specific corrective/remedial measures, including
appropriate time frames and goals for achievement of compliance. Specific courses of
enforcement action which may be considered for use by the Central Bank of Kenya will
be communicated to each individual institution as and when the need arises.

1.4

Definition - Terms used in this Guideline are as defined in the Banking Act.

PART II: IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
The following actions will be taken if, ordinarily, the management of institutions subject
to such actions has demonstrated a disregard for safe and sound banking practices and/or
the lack of willingness or ability to correct weaknesses or problems on their own. It
should be noted that the enforcement actions contained herein are not exhaustive and
CBK is at liberty to prescribe any remedial action that it considers appropriate in light of
the lapses/violations being addressed.
2.1

Board Resolutions
The Central Bank may require an institution to pass Board Resolutions which are
acceptable commitments or responses from institutions that exhibit supervisory concerns,
where such actions clearly evidence a board’s commitment to effect prompt correction of
weaknesses or violations. Such resolutions should indicate the time frame within which
compliance will be attained.

2.2

Commitment Letter
This is a letter from the Central Bank to an institution’s board of directors outlining
specific corrective actions to be undertaken by the bank management which should be
accepted and signed by the bank’s directors indicating their commitment to comply with
323

the specific recommendations. The concerns raised will have been identified whether
through on-site inspection or off-site surveillance. The signed original letter should be
returned to the Supervision Department within 30 days and a copy be retained with the
institution’s official records.
2.3

Memorandum of Understanding
This is a written agreement initiated by the Central Bank of Kenya setting forth specific
corrective/remedial actions to be undertaken by an institution’s board of directors.
Failure to comply within a specified time frame by the board of directors could result in
subsequent action of a legal nature. The weaknesses in need of correction will also have
been identified either through on-site or off-site supervision.

2.4

Issuance of Directives
The following corrective actions are authorized by Section 33(1) of The Banking Act if
the Central Bank of Kenya has reason to believe that:
a)

the business of an institution is being conducted in a manner contrary to or not in
compliance with the requirements of the Act or of any guideline made there under
or in any manner detrimental to or not in the best interest of its depositors or
members of the public; or

b)

an institution, any of its officers or other person participating in the general
management of the institution is engaged in any practice likely to occasion a
contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or any regulations made there
under, the Central Bank of Kenya may:
i.

give advice and make recommendations to the institution with regard to the
conduct of its business generally;

ii.

issue directions regarding measures to be taken to improve the management or
business methods or to secure or improve compliance with the Act, regulations or
other written law or regulations;

iii.

issue directions, in the case of Section 33 (1) (b), to an institution, officer or
other person to cease such practice;

iv.

appoint a person to advise and assist the institution generally or for the purposes
of implementing any directions under (i) and (ii) above and such person’s advice
shall have the same force and effect as a direction and shall be deemed to be a
direction of the Central Bank of Kenya.
324

However, prior to the above action, notice of intention shall be served on the institution
or the officer as the case may be, to show cause why such a direction should not be
issued.
2.5

Removal of Officers and Denial of Corporate Approvals
The following corrective actions are authorized by Section 33A of The Banking Act and
may be issued where an auditor’s report, under Section 24 (4) or an inspection report
under Part VII of the Banking Act reveals that an institution conducts its business in a
manner contrary to the provisions of the Act or any regulations made there under or in
any manner detrimental to or not in the best interests of its depositors or members of the
public:

2.6

a)

restrict, suspend or prohibit the payment of dividends;

b)

prohibit the conversion of any profits into capital;

c)

direct the suspension or removal of any officer involved in such conduct;

d)

require the institution to reconstitute its board of directors;

e)

withhold branch or other corporate approvals.

CBK Intervention in the management of an institution
Corrective actions are authorized under the provisions of Section 34 of The Banking Act
by the Central Bank if:
a)

the institution fails to meet any financial obligation, when it falls due, including
an obligation to pay any depositor;

b)

a petition is filed, or a resolution proposed, for the winding up of the institution
or if any receiver or receiver and manager or similar officer is appointed;

c)

the auditor makes a report to Central Bank of Kenya under the provisions of
subsection (4)of section 24; or

d)

the Central Bank of Kenya discovers or becomes aware of any fact or
circumstance which warrants the exercise of the relevant power in the interests of
the institution or its depositors or other creditors.

e)

if the institution is significantly undercapitalized; or
325

f)

if the institution fails:
(i)

to submit a capital restoration plan or a plan to resolve all deficiencies
directed under Section 33A; or

as

PART II: STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1

Purpose
This Guideline outlines the minimum requirements that institutions should implement to
ensure that business operations are not adversely affected in the event of a disruption. It
is envisaged that by implementing this Guideline, institutions will both reduce the
likelihood and impact of operational disruption and ensure business continuity in order to
maintain public trust and confidence in the financial system.

2.2

Scope
This Guideline sets the minimum requirements for establishing sound and effective
business continuity management practices by institutions.

2.3

Responsibility
The responsibility for business continuity management ultimately rests with the board of
directors and the senior management of an institution. They are expected to formulate
business continuity policy, procedures, guidelines and set minimum standards for an
institution. All of these must be documented and available for review by an external
auditor and the Central Bank of Kenya.

335

PART III SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
3.1

Board of Directors and Senior Management
3.1.1

Major duties and responsibilities
An institution’s board and senior management are responsible for the
development, implementation and maintenance of policies that ensure the
resilience and continuity of an institution, in the event of major operational
disruptions. The board fulfills its business continuity planning responsibilities by
setting policy, prioritizing critical business functions, allocating sufficient
resources and personnel, providing oversight ,approving the Business Continuity
Plan (BCP), reviewing test results and ensuring maintenance of the current plan.
These responsibilities include but are not limited to the following: -

3.1.1.1 Ensure that business continuity planning forms an integral part of the
overall risk management of an institution and that business continuity
processes are documented and embedded in an organization’s operations.
The board of directors and senior management are required to:
a)

Ensure a documented Policy on BCM is put in place.

b)

Define the roles, responsibilities and authority to act in the event of a
major disruption, namely:
i.

At the organizational level, overall management of the business
continuity function on a day-to day basis should be assigned to a
Business Continuity Management Team. The selection of the Team
should be contingent upon the nature of business activities, size,
complexity, and geographical location of an institution.
The basic composition of the Business Continuity Management
Team should at a minimum constitute the following;
1.
2.
3.
4.

ii.

Co-coordinator (drawn from the senior management).
Functional Department Heads.
Line Managers.
Risk Management Officer.

In the event that an institution opts to outsource the business
continuity function, it should ensure that accountability for business
336

continuity management ultimately rests with the board of directors
and senior management.
iii.

In cases where institutions share a disaster recovery site, there must
be service level agreements in place that clearly outline the terms
that govern these arrangements between the parties.

iv.

In cases where recovery sites are outsourced to a vendor or
supplier, a signed contract must exist with service level agreements
that support such an arrangement.

v.

In outsourced solutions that are syndicated, care must be taken not
to syndicate services between banks where they have normal
business functions close or adjacent to each other i.e. a bank back
office operation in Nairobi which is next to or a few blocks away
from another bank and uses the same vendor should not have
syndicated solutions utilizing the same syndicated infrastructure.
For the above, dedicated options should be taken to ensure
recovery in the event of a city wide incident.

vi.

Office, data centre or server room recovery must not be in the
same building or close to the normal business operation.

vii.

Distance from the normal business and recovery facility will
depend on individual needs but it is proposed that if a bank has its
head office or back office function within the city limits, they
should have their recovery facilities outside of the city centre. If
the recovery site is within the city centre then the Head office or
back office function should be located outside the city limits. Care
should be taken to look at other factors such as a second power
grid and telecommunications infrastructure i.e. a power outage of
the normal business functions should not be able to affect the
recovery facility.

viii.

Recovery facilities must include all the necessary backup power
generation and supply (Generator, UPS and adequate fuel supply).

ix.

Utilization of alternate sites for recovery within the same
organization must be at an adequate distance from the operation
based on above criteria. If the alternate site is utilized for normal
and recovery operations a documented and tested plan must be in
place to support such an arrangement.
337

3.1.1.2

x.

Recovery solutions must be based on Business Impact Assessment
(BIA) information.

xi.

Documented pre and post-test reports are to be completed for all
recovery testing.

c)

Ensure that employees are trained and made aware of their roles in the
implementation of the Business Continuity Plan.

d)

Ensure that sufficient human and financial resources are made available to provide
support for Business Continuity Management.

e)

Ensure that the business continuity plans not only consider the business process
and technical aspects, but also recognize and addresses the human element. The
overriding consideration in formulating an institution’s business continuity plan
should be for the preservation of human life.
Establish a framework for crisis management
Establish a Crisis Management Team, consisting of key executives and functional
heads of critical operational areas who will be responsible for dealing with crisis
management and business continuity during a crisis. This will require the institution to
re-prioritize and re-allocate resources in order to expedite recovery. The roles and
responsibilities of each individual member/team should be clearly defined. Institutions
must take into account all relevant potential scenarios that could result in a crisis for
the bank. The term crisis denotes a threatening situation that calls for critical decisions
and cannot be handled with or with ordinary management tools and decision making
powers. The following are examples of crisis management situations.
 Accident like events such as fires or explosions.
 Terrorist attacks and sabotage.
 Natural disasters such as floods and earth quakes.
 Mass absence of personnel due to a pandemic.
 Failure of building technology or energy supply.
 Failure of external suppliers (outsourcing) such as information providers.
 Failure of communication systems or Telecommunication providers.
 Failure of IT systems or infrastructure hardware or software.
Crisis management recommended best practice
 A detailed crisis management plan should be in place.
 The crisis management plan contains instructions on how to respond in event of
causalities and fatalities. The plan should stipulate that priority is to attend to
causalities and fatalities.
 Adjustments to crisis management plan should be made when threats change
significantly.
338










The senior management team knows who is in the crisis management team and
has approved their selection.
The senior management team understands the crisis management teams terms of
reference.
The crisis management team is responsible for managing all critical internal issues
to resolution.
The core crisis management team may be supplemented by preselected and trained
specialists according to incident type scale and severity.
At least 70% of the crisis management team should have been involved in tests
and crisis management incidents in the preceding 12 months.
Once activated the crisis management team has full authority for all decisions
including powers to spend during the crisis.
The primary command centre to support the crisis management team should be
fully equipped with necessary facilities e.g. telephones, computers and printers.
If the command centre is inaccessible the crisis management team may be
accommodated in an alternative primary or secondary location.

3.1.1.3 Establish a framework for review and monitoring by the Board of Directors and
Senior Management
a)

Business Continuity Plans should be reviewed and approved by the Board of
Directors on an annual basis. Some information such as contact details should be
reviewed on a monthly or quarterly basis.
However, certain events may trigger the need for an immediate review of the BCP.
These include significant changes in the following;
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

Business strategy and risk appetite of an institution.
Restructuring of an institution, either through expansion or through a merger
or acquisition.
Key technology and telecommunications.
Service providers.
Regulatory and legislative requirements.
Composition and size of staff.

b) An institution’s business continuity plan should be subject to an independent review
on an annual basis and the findings reported to the board of directors on a timely
basis. This is through assurance and business continuity management audits conducted
at a predetermined frequency.

339

3.1.1.4 Ensure compliance with all Prudential Guidelines and all other regulatory and legal
requirements related to Business Continuity Management
An institution should comply with the Banking Act, Prudential Guidelines and all other
applicable laws and regulations which fall under jurisdiction of other regulatory
authorities.
3.2

Business Continuity Management Team
The major roles and responsibilities of the Business Continuity Management Team should
be as follows;
3.2.1 To develop and approve a business continuity management process and plan.
An institution’s business continuity plan should be developed along the following
five levels which reflect the business continuity management life cycle;
i.

Strategic level; Examine the organizational framework taking note of the
key business stakeholders, legislative and regulatory requirements in
relation to business continuity.

ii.

Process level; - Develop resumption strategies for business processes and
activities.

iii.

Resource Recovery; Ensure the deployment of appropriate resources to
ensure appropriate continuity across all business processes and activities.

iv.

Awareness and Education; develop a business continuity culture through
assessment of business continuity awareness campaigns. Ensure that the
BCM Management Team is trained and that appropriate skills are in place.

v.

Testing, Maintenance, Measurement and Audit; Ensure reliability of
the business continuity plan of an organization through independent review
and testing.

3.2.2 Ensure that the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is updated to reflect the changes in
an institution’s risk profile
The Business Continuity Management Team should ensure that the (BCP) business
continuity plan is reviewed annually, though the frequency may be modified to take into
account changes in the business strategy, business processes, personnel, location or
technology and changes in the external business environment.
340

3.2.3 Ensure the implementation of the business continuity plan by periodically conducting
a business impact analysis, (at least once a year) an enterprise – wide risk
assessment, risk management and risk monitoring to identify the mission critical
activities and potential for major disruptions.
Business Impact Analysis(BIA’s) must be signed off by department or functional heads
through a formal functional process stipulating that they understand, accept and verify
BIA’s are correct.
3.2.3.1 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
Major operational disruptions pose a substantial risk to the continued operation of an
institution. The extent to which an institution incorporates the risk of a major operational
disruption in its business continuity plan is dependent upon its risk profile.
Business impact analysis forms the foundation upon which the business continuity plan is
developed. It identifies critical business functions and operations that need to be
recovered on a priority basis and establishes appropriate recovery objectives for those
operations. It should be completed in advance of a risk assessment in order to identify the
urgent functions upon which a risk assessment should be focused. At a minimum a
business impact analysis is expected to;
i.

Provide an understanding of an institution’s most critical objectives, the priority,
and the timeframes for resumption of each (recovery objective and recovery
time).

ii.

Provide information about resource requirements over time to enable each
business function within the organization achieve continuity or resumption of
activity within the established timeframes. It should at a minimum identify;
a. Staff numbers and key skills.
b. Data applications and systems.
c. Facilities including alternative location needs, backup strategy policy and
schedule.
d. Vendors/suppliers of various services.
e. Constraints.
f. Mission Critical Activities (MCA’s) or tasks that need to be recorded to
ensure continuity of the process and business.
g. Dependencies on people, systems, processes, internal and external parties.
h. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for
every MCA or business.
i. Systems impact assessment.
j. Location.
k. Department unit owners, system information, commissioning dates.
341

l. Technical person responsible.
m. RTO, RPO and dependences.
iii.

Provide a list of recovery options for each business process.
Methods and techniques
A combination of the following tools and techniques may used to carry out
Business Impact Analysis;
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

Questionnaires.
Interviews.
Workshops.

Generally a combination of all the above methods should provide an adequate source of
information from which to base the Business Continuity Plan. All relevant information
should be stored for reference for at least one year or until the next BIA.
3.2.3.2 Risk Assessment
A risk assessment examines the most urgent business functions identified during business
impact analysis. It looks at the probability and impact of a variety of specific threats that
could cause a business disruption. A risk assessment is at a minimum expected to achieve
the following;
i.
ii.
.iii.
iv.
v.

Identify unacceptable concentrations of risk and what are known as ‘single points
of failure’.
Identify internal and external threats that could cause a disruption and assess their
probability and impact.
Prioritize threats according to the institution.
Provide information for a risk control management strategy and an action plan for
risks to be addressed.
Mitigation of risks through a documented remediation plan.

Methods and Techniques
The methods and techniques to be used to provide a risk assessment include;
a.
Insurance statistics.
b.
Published disaster frequency statistics.
c.
Scoring systems for impact and probability.
d.
Gap analysis.
e.
Stress testing.

342

3.2.3.3 Recovery objectives
Institutions should develop recovery objectives that reflect the risk they represent to the
operation of the financial system. Institutions should factor in interdependency risks when
developing their recovery objectives. Consequently, institution’s business continuity
management team should:
a)
b)
c)

Make an assessment of the risks they pose to the financial sector based on critical
services they provide and their significance to the financial system.
Identify those business functions and operations to be recovered on a priority basis
and establish recovery objectives.
Establish recovery objectives proportional to the risk they pose to the financial
system.

When evaluating whether an institution’s business continuity plan can accommodate
major operational disruptions an institution should review the adequacy of recovery
arrangements in areas such as;
i.

The alternate site should be sufficiently remote from the main branch of an
institution.

ii

The alternate site should be sufficiently equipped with the necessary equipment,
data and to maintain critical operations and services for a sufficient time period.
An inventory of assets (backup tapes, communication links, operating systems,
hardware) needed for offsite recovery should be generated.

iii.

The business continuity plan should address staff requirements and reallocation to
the alternate site in the event of a major disruption. A detailed list of tasks for
offsite recovery should be made available to all concerned staff.

3.2.4 Report on the status of business continuity management to the board and senior
management on a regular basis, highlighting where there are identified gaps. This is
through implementation status reports, incident reports, testing results and related plans
for strengthening the business continuity plan. Institutions should also report
activation/invocation of their BCP’s to the Central Bank of Kenya within 24 hours of the
activation/invocation.
3.2.5 Facilitate testing of plans to ensure that crisis and recovery teams are aware of their
roles and responsibilities in the event of a disruption
Testing the ability of an institution to recover critical operations is an essential component
of effective business continuity management.
343

Though emphasis is made on testing technical recovery, the key element to be examined
is human resource, ensuring that skills, knowledge, management and decision making
ability is assessed. An institution should ensure that;
a)

Testing of the overall business continuity management of an institution should at a
minimum be conducted at least once a year.
The frequency of testing should be dependent upon the nature, size, risks and
complexity of the institution. The amount of tests should depend on the criticality
of the business process.

b)

The frequency of testing for key functional areas is determined by how critical
they are to an institution and any material changes to an institution’s internal and
external environment.

c)

There are measures for the quality of planning, competency of staff and
effectiveness of the business continuity plan.

d)

There is organizational awareness of emergency procedures and team members
and staffs are familiar with their roles, accountability, responsibilities and
authority in response to an incident.

e)

All technological, logistical and administration aspects of the business continuity
plan have been tested.

f)

The recovery of infrastructure including command centres and off site work area
is assured.

g)

The opportunity to identify shortcomings and improvements to the institution’s
business continuity readiness is a continuous process.

h)

The availability and relocation of staff is assessed.

i)

Documentation of testing results for the board of directors, senior management,
auditors and regulators.
Methods and techniques
Management should develop a test plan for each BCP testing method used. An
institution is expected to employ various methods of exercising including but not
limited to the following;

344

a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

Technical tests.
Desktop /Orientation/walkthroughs.
Live runs.
Simulations.
Integrated tests for departments that are dependent on each other and also
stress testing of recovery facilities.

3.2.6 Ensure that the institution’s response to a disruption is communicated internally and
externally to applicable parties. External communication to the media should only be
through the external communications teams and approved by senior management or the
board.
3.2.6.1 Communication
Institutions should include in their business continuity plans procedures for communicating
within their institution and with relevant external parties in the event of major disruptions. The
communication procedures for an institution should:
a)

Ensure that there is a clear plan identifying staff, for communicating internally (within the
organization) and externally (to the public) stakeholders.

b)

Establish communication protocols clearly outlining the chain of command from the board
of directors, chief executive, and senior management; Develop a directory for all recovery
team members including the crisis management and emergency management teams, local
emergency response organisations and critical service providers.

PART I: Preliminary
1.1. Title ” Guideline on Outsourcing.
1.2 Authorization - This Guideline is issued under Section 33(4) of the Banking Act,
which empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue guidelines to be adhered to
by institutions in order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial
system.
1.3 Application ” This Guideline applies to all institutions licensed under the Banking
Act (cap 488) who desire to outsource aspects of their activities.
1.4 Definitions ” The terms used in this Guideline are as defined in the Banking Act
(Cap. 488). Other terms used in this guideline shall be taken to have the meaning
assigned to them hereunder:
1.4.1 'Outsourcing' means the use of a third party (either an affiliated entity
within a corporate group or an entity that is external to the corporate group)
to perform activities on a continuing basis that would normally be
undertaken by the institution itself, now or in the future.
1.4.2 ‘‘Service provider’’ refers to an entity that is undertaking the outsourced
activity on behalf of the institution and includes a member of the group to
which the institution belongs, unrelated company whether located in Kenya
or outside.
1.4.3 ‚Off shoring’’ means outsourcing activities beyond national borders.
1.4.4 Material Outsourcing
Material outsourcing arrangements are those, which if disrupted, have the
potential to significantly impact the business operations, reputation or
profitability of the institution.
1.4.5 An institution should assess the degree of materiality in an outsourcing
arrangement to the institution. Materiality of outsourcing would be based on:
a)
b)

The level of importance of the activity being outsourced to the bank;
The potential impact of the outsourcing on the institution on various
parameters such as earnings, solvency, liquidity, funding and capital
and risk profile;
394

c)

d)
e)

f)

The likely impact on the institution’s reputation and brand value, and
ability to achieve its business objectives, strategy and plans, should
the service provider fail to perform the service;
The cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of
the institution;
The aggregate exposure to that particular service provider, in cases
where the institution out sources various activities to the same service
provider.
An activity is considered material if it accounts for at least five
percent (5%) of the institution’s revenues or costs.

PART II: STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1

Purpose - This guideline is to provide guidance to institutions seeking to outsource
material activities that form part of the financial service operations.

2.2

Scope – This guideline provides a clear guide to institutions on the conditions they
must fulfill before and during an outsourcing arrangement.

2.3

Responsibility – It is the responsibility of an institution proposing to outsource,
and those that have outsourced, any of their activities to ensure compliance with
this Guideline.

PART III: Background
3.1

While outsourcing can bring cost savings and other benefits, it may also increase
the risk profile of an institution. Some of the key risks in outsourcing are Strategic
Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance Risk, Operational Risk, Exit Strategy Risk,
Counterparty Risk, Country Risk, Contractual Risk, Access Risk Concentration
and Systemic Risk.
The failure of a service provider in providing a specified service, a breach in
security/confidentiality or non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
by either the service provider or the outsourcing institution can lead to financial
losses/reputational risk for the bank and could also lead to systemic risks within the
entire banking system in the country. It would therefore be imperative for an
institution outsourcing its activities to ensure effective management of the potential
risks.

395

PART IV: SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Prohibitions
4.1.1 No institution shall outsource material activities unless it has obtained
approval from the Central Bank of Kenya for such purpose.

4.1.3 Institutions will need to notify the Central Bank when outsourcing these
non-material activities.
 Courier services.
 Mail.

legal obligations. The board and senior management of the institutions
retains the ultimate responsibility for the outsourced activity.
4.2.2 Institutions remain responsible for the actions of their service provider
and the confidentiality of information pertaining to the customers that
is available with the service provider. Therefore the institutions should
retain ultimate control of the outsourced activity.
4.2.3 When an institution is performing due diligence in relation to
outsourcing, it is imperative to consider all relevant laws, regulations,
guidelines and conditions of approval, licensing or registration.

4.3

Internal Controls and Standard of Care
4.3.1 An institution should not engage in outsourcing that results in its
internal control, business conduct or reputation being compromised or
weakened.
4.3.2 An institution has to take steps to ensure that the service provider
employs a high standard of care in performing the services as if the
activity were not outsourced.
4.3.3 The institution also needs to maintain the capability and appropriate
level of monitoring and control over outsourcing, such that in the event
397

of disruption or unexpected termination of the service, it remains able to
conduct its business with integrity and competence.
4.4

Customer Rights
4.4.1 Outsourcing arrangements should not affect the rights of a customer
against the institution, including the ability of the customer to obtain
redress as applicable under relevant laws.
4.4.2 Where the customers are required to deal with the service providers in
the process of dealing with the institution, the institution must reveal to
their customers in the product brochures/agreements the role of the
service provider and their obligations towards the customers.

4.5 Risk Management Practices For Outsourced Financial Services
4.5.1 Outsourcing Policy
An institution intending to outsource any of its financial activities should
put in place a comprehensive outsourcing policy, approved by its Board,
which incorporates, inter -alia;
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

g)
h)
i)
j)

strategic goals, objectives and business needs of an institution in
relation to outsourcing;
clear definition of the range of activities that may be outsourced and
those core activities which cannot be outsourced;
steps that should be taken in evaluating whether a particular activity is
appropriate for outsourcing;
criteria for determining material outsourcing;
processes for evaluating risks associated with an outsourced activity;
criteria for evaluating outsourcing relationships (with service
providers) including necessary controls and reporting processes on an
ongoing basis;
eligibility criteria for selecting service providers taking into account
any relation, directly or indirectly, with the latter;
issues addressing risk concentrations and risks arising from outsourcing
multiple activities to the same service provider;
steps that should be taken to ensure compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements in both home and host countries; and
contingency plan in case of business disruptions.

398

4.5.2 Role of the Board
The Board and Senior Management of an institution retain ultimate
responsibility for effective management of risks arising from outsourcing.
While an institution may delegate its day-to-day operational duties to the
service provider, the responsibilities for effective due diligence, oversight
and management of outsourcing and accountability for all outsourcing
decisions, continue to rest with the institution, its board and senior
management. The board or a committee delegated by it is responsible for:
a)

b)
c)

d)

Approving a framework to evaluate the risks and materiality of all
existing and prospective outsourcing and the policies that apply to
such arrangements;
Laying down appropriate approval authorities for outsourcing
depending on risks and materiality;
Undertaking regular review of outsourcing strategies and
arrangements for their continued relevance, and safety and soundness;
and
Deciding on business activities of a material nature to be outsourced,
and approving such arrangements.

4.5.3 Role of Senior Management
Senior management of an institution is responsible for the following are as
related to outsourcing:
a)
b)

c)
d)
e)
f)
g)

Evaluating the risks and materiality of all existing and prospective
outsourcing, based on the framework approved by the board;
Developing and implementing sound and prudent outsourcing
policies and procedures commensurate with the nature, scope and
complexity of the outsourcing;
Reviewing periodically the effectiveness of policies and procedures;
Communicating information pertaining to material outsourcing risks
to the board in a timely manner;
Ensuring that contingency plans, based on realistic and probable
disruptive scenarios, are in place and tested;
Undertaking periodic review of outsourcing arrangements to identify
new material outsourcing risks as they arise; and
Ensuring that there is independent review and audit for compliance
with set policies.

4.5.4 Evaluation of the Risks
To satisfy themselves that an outsourcing arrangement does not result in
the internal control, business or reputation of an institution being
399

compromised or weakened, its board and senior management should be
fully aware of and understand the risks in outsourcing and their impact on
the institution. A framework for systemic risk evaluation should be
established and it should include the following steps:
a)

b)

c)

d)

Identification of the role of outsourcing in the overall business
strategy and objectives of the institution, and its interaction with
corporate strategic goals;
Comprehensive due diligence on the nature, scope and complexity
of the outsourcing to identify the key risks and risks mitigation
strategies;
Analysis of the impact of the arrangement on the overall risk profile
of the institution, and whether there are adequate internal expertise
and resources to mitigate the risks identified; and
Analysis of risk-return on the potential benefits of outsourcing
against the vulnerabilities that may arise, ranging from the impact of
temporary disruption to that of an unexpected termination in the
outsourcing, and whether for strategic and internal control reasons,
the arrangement should be entered into.

Evaluation of outsourcing arrangements should be performed when an institution is
planning to enter into outsourcing arrangements, as a part of the outsourcing approval and
strategic planning or review processes of the institution.
The key risks in outsourcing that need to be addressed by institutions include:
a) Strategic Risk ” Every bank operates with some strategic long and short term goals.
The service provider should relate to these goals. Strategic risk arises where the
business practices of service providers are at odds with the short and long term
objectives of the bank.
b) Reputation Risk ” Poor service from the service provider, its customer interaction not
being consistent with the overall standards of the institution,
c) Compliance Risk ” Privacy, consumer and prudential laws not adequately complied
with,
d) Operational Risk ” Arising due to technology failure, fraud, error, inadequate
financial capacity to fulfill obligations and/or provide remedies,
e) Exit Strategy Risk ” This could arise from over”reliance on one firm, the loss of
relevant skills in the institution itself preventing it from bringing the activity back inhouse and contracts entered into wherein speedy exits would be prohibitively
expensive,
f) Counterparty Risk ” Due to inappropriate credit assessments, which can diminish the
quality of loans.
400

g) Country Risk ” Due to the political, social or legal climate creating added risk,
h) Contractual risk ” arising from whether or not the bank has the ability to enforce the
contract, and
i) Concentration and Systemic Risk ” Due to lack of control of individual banks over a
service provider, more so when overall banking industry has considerable exposure to
one service provider.
4.5.5

Evaluating the Capability of the Service Provider
4.5.5.1

4.5.5.2
4.5.5.3

4.5.5.4

4.5.5.5

In considering or renewing an outsourcing arrangement, appropriate
due diligence should be performed to assess the capability of the
service provider to comply with obligations in the outsourcing
agreement.
Due diligence should take into consideration qualitative and
quantitative, financial, operational and reputational factors.
Institutions should consider whether the service providers' systems
are compatible with their own and also whether their standards of
performance including customer service are acceptable.
Where possible, institutions should obtain independent reviews and
market feedback on the service provider to supplement their own due
diligence findings.
The due diligence should involve an evaluation of all available
information about the service provider, including but not limited to:a)
b)
c)
d)

e)

f)

Past experience and competence to implement and support
the proposed activity over the contracted period;
Financial soundness and ability to service commitments
even under adverse conditions;
Business reputation and culture, compliance, complaints
and outstanding or potential litigation;
Security and internal control, audit coverage, reporting
and monitoring environment, Business continuity
management;
External factors like political, economic, social and legal
environment of the jurisdiction in which the service
provider operates and other events that may impact
service performance.
Ensuring due diligence by service provider of its
employees.

401

4.5.5.6

4.5.5.7

4.5.5.8

4.5.5.9

Due diligence undertaken during the initial evaluation process
should be documented and re-performed periodically as part of
the monitoring and control processes of outsourcing.
The due diligence process can vary depending on the nature of
the outsourcing arrangement. For instance, reduced due
diligence may be sufficient where no developments or changes
have arisen to affect an existing outsourcing arrangements or
where the outsourcing is to a member of the group.
An institution should ensure that the information used for due
diligence evaluation is current and should not be more than 12
months old.
Institutions should at least on annual basis review the financial
and operational conditions of the service provider to assess the
ability to meet its outsourcing obligations. Such due diligence
should highlight any deterioration or breach in standards,
confidentiality, security or Business Continuity preparedness.

4.5.6 The Outsourcing Agreement
4.5.6.1 Outsourcing arrangements should be governed by a clearly written
contract, the nature and detail of which should be appropriate to the
materiality of the outsourced activity in relation to the ongoing
business of the regulated entity.
4.5.6.2 A written contract is an important management tool and appropriate
contractual provisions can reduce the risk of non-performance or
disagreements regarding the scope, nature and quality of the service
to be provided.
4.5.6.3 The terms and conditions governing the contract between the
institution and the service provider should be carefully defined in
written agreements and vetted by a competent authority on their legal
effect and enforceability.
4.5.6.4 Every outsourcing agreement should address the risks and risk
mitigation strategies identified at the risk evaluation and due
diligence stages.
4.5.6.5 The agreement should be sufficiently flexible to allow the institution
to retain an appropriate level of control over the outsourced activity
and the right to intervene with appropriate measures to meet legal
and regulatory obligations.
4.5.6.6 The agreement should also bring out the nature of legal relationship
between the parties, that is, whether agent”principal or otherwise.
Some of the key provisions of the contract include:

402

a)

b)

c)

d)

e)

f)
g)

h)

i)

j)

k)
l)

The contract should clearly define what activities are going to
be outsourced including appropriate service and performance
standards.
The institution must ensure it has the ability to access all
books, records and information relevant to the outsourced
activity in the service provider.
The contract should provide for continuous monitoring and
assessment by the institution of the service provider so that
any necessary corrective measure can be taken immediately.
A termination clause and minimum periods to execute a
termination provision, if deemed necessary, should be
included.
Controls to ensure customer data confidentiality and service
providers' liability in case of breach of security and leakage
of confidential customer related information.
Contingency plans to ensure business continuity.
The contract should provide for the approval by the institution
of the use of subcontractors by the service provider for all or
part of an outsourced activity.
Provide the institution with the right to conduct audits, on the
service provider whether by its internal or external auditors,
or by agents appointed to act on its behalf and to obtain copies
of any audit or review reports and findings made on the
service provider in conjunction with the services performed
for the institution.
A clause to allow the Central Bank or persons authorized by it
to access the institution’s documents, records of transactions,
and other necessary information given to, stored or processed
by the service provider within a reasonable time. The
Agreement should further provide that in the event these are
not made accessible to the Central Bank within a reasonable
time, the Central Bank may pursue any or all of the remedial
actions and administrative sanctions provided for under the
Banking Act.
A clause to recognize the right of the Central Bank to cause
an inspection to be made of a service provider of a bank and
its books and account by one or more of its officers or
employees or other persons.
There should be dispute resolution mechanism between parties
involved in outsourcing contract.
Details of pricing and fee structure of outsourcing contract
should be provided
403

4.5.7

Confidentiality and Security

As public confidence in institutions is a cornerstone in the stability and reputation of
the financial industry, it is vital that an institution satisfies itself that the service
provider’s security policies, procedures and controls will enable the institution to
protect confidentiality and security of the customer information. An institution
should take the following steps as minimum to ensure that the issue of customer
confidentiality is addressed:a) Access to customer information by staff of the service provider should be limited
to those areas where the information is required in order to perform the
outsourced function.
b) The institution should ensure that the service provider is able to isolate and
clearly identify the institution’s customer information, documents, records and
assets to protect the confidentiality of the information.
c) The institution should review and monitor the security practices and control
processes of the service provider on a regular basis and require the service
provider to disclose security breaches.
d) The institution should immediately notify CBK in the event of any breach of
security and leakage of confidential customer related information. In these
eventualities, the institution would be liable to its customers for any damage.
4.5.8 Business Continuity Management
An institution should ensure that its business continuity preparedness is not compromised
by outsourcing. The institution should take steps to evaluate and satisfy itself that the
interdependency risk arising from the outsourcing arrangement can be adequately
mitigated such that the institution remains able to conduct its business with integrity and
competence in the event of disruption, or unexpected termination of the outsourcing or
liquidation of the service provider. The steps to ensure business continuity in outsourcing
arrangements include:a) The institution requiring its service providers to develop and establish a robust
framework for documenting, maintaining and testing business continuity and recovery
procedures. Institutions need to ensure that the service provider periodically tests the
Business Continuity and Recovery Plan and may also consider occasional joint testing
and recovery exercises with its service providers.
b) In order to mitigate the risk of unexpected termination of the outsourcing agreement or
liquidation of the service provider, institutions should retain an appropriate level of
control over their outsourcing and the right to intervene with appropriate measures to
continue its business operations in such cases without incurring prohibitive expenses
404

and without any break in the operations of the institution and its services to the
customers.
c) In establishing a viable contingency plan, institutions should consider the availability
of alternative service providers or the possibility of bringing the outsourced activity
back in-house in an emergency and the costs, time and resources that would be
involved.
d) Outsourcing often leads to the sharing of facilities operated by the service provider.
The institution should ensure that service providers are able to isolate the institution’s
information, documents and records, and other assets. This is to ensure that in adverse
conditions, all documents, records of transactions and information given to the service
provider, and assets of the institution, can be removed from the possession of the
service provider in order to continue its business operations, or deleted, destroyed or
rendered unusable.
4.5.9 Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities
4.5.9.1 The institution should have in place a management structure to monitor
and control its outsourcing activities. Such a structure will vary depending
on the nature, scope and complexity of the outsourced activities.
4.5.9.2 As outsourcing relationships and interdependence increase in materiality
and complexity, a more rigorous risk management approach should be
adopted. An institution also has to be more proactive in its relationship
with the service provider.
4.5.9.3 An outsourcing arrangement which was previously not material may
subsequently become material from incremental activities outsourced to the
same service provider or an increase in volume or nature of the activity
outsourced to the service provider. Material outsourcing risks may also
arise when the service provider in a material outsourcing plans to subcontract the service or makes significant changes to its sub-contracting
arrangements.
4.5.9.4 The institution should ensure that outsourcing agreements with the service
providers contain provisions to address their monitoring and control of
outsourced activities.
4.5.9.5 A structure for effective monitoring and control of material outsourcing
would comprise the following:
a) A central record of all material outsourcing that is readily accessible
for review by the board and senior management of the institution
should be maintained. The records should be updated promptly and
form part of the corporate governance reviews undertaken by the board
and senior management of the institution.
405

b) Regular audits by either the internal auditors or external auditors of the
bank should assess the adequacy of the risk management practices
adopted in overseeing and managing the outsourcing arrangement, the
institution’s compliance with its risk management framework and the
requirements of these guidelines.
c) Institutions should at least on an annual basis, review the financial and
operational condition of the service provider to assess its ability to
continue to meet its outsourcing obligations. Such due diligence
reviews, which can be based on all available information about the
service provider should highlight any deterioration or breach in
performance standards, confidentiality and security, and in business
continuity preparedness.
4.6 Regulatory and supervisory requirements
4.6.1

An institution should not enter into any outsourcing arrangement of a
material function before getting approval from CBK.
4.6.2 Proposals to outsource material functions must be submitted to CBK in
writing well in advance of the date on which it is intended that the
outsourcing will commence.
4.6.3 An institution that has entered into or is planning material outsourcing, or
is planning to vary any such outsourcing arrangements, should notify
CBK of such arrangements.
4.6.4 The degree of detail of the proposal will depend on the functions that the
bank proposes to outsource and the service provider to be used. The
proposal should include details of:
 the rationale for the outsourcing,
 details relating to the proposed service provider,
 Risk matrix identifying potential risks and how they will be mitigated.
 draft outsourcing agreement between the parties involved, and
 a description of the methods that the bank will employ to ensure that it
retains its ability to control and monitor the outsourced functions.
4.6.5 Outsourcing, whether the service provider is located in Kenya or abroad
should not impede or interfere with the ability of the institution to
effectively oversee and manage its activities or impede the Central Bank
in carrying out its regulatory and supervisory functions.

4.7 Off-shore outsourcing of financial services
4.7.1 The engagement of service providers in a foreign country exposes an
institution to country risks including economic, social and political

406

Conditions and events in a foreign country that may adversely affect the institution.
4.7.2 These conditions and events could prevent the service provider from
carrying out the terms of the outsourcing agreement with the institution.
4.7.3 To manage the country risk involved in off-shore outsourcing activities, the
institution should take into account and closely monitor government policies
as well as political, social, economic and legal conditions in countries
where the service provider is based, during the risk assessment process and
on a continuous basis, and establish sound procedures for dealing with
country risk problems. This includes having appropriate contingency and
exit strategies.
4.7.4 Off-shore outsourcing arrangements should only be entered into with parties
operating in jurisdictions generally upholding confidentiality clauses and
agreements. The governing law of the arrangement should also be clearly
specified.
4.7.5 The activities outsourced outside Kenya should be conducted in a manner so
as not to hinder efforts to supervise or reconstruct the Kenyan activities of
the bank in a timely manner. Specifically, an institution should not
outsource to jurisdictions where unfettered access to information by CBK or
its authorized person, and the internal and external auditors of the bank,
may be impeded by legal or administrative restrictions. CBK may
communicate directly with the home or host regulator of the institution or
the service provider, as the case may be, to seek confirmation relating to
these matters.

3.3.3 The financial statements of the parent institution and its subsidiaries shall be
prepared as of the same date. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is
different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary should prepare, for consolidation
purposes, additional financial statements as of the same date as the financial
statements of the parent.
3.3.4 The consolidated financial statements should include consolidated balance sheet,
consolidated statement of profit and loss, statement of cash flow, principal
accounting policies and notes on accounts. The group accounts should be prepared
using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar
circumstances. If it is not practicable to do so, that fact should be disclosed
together with the proportions of the items in the consolidated financial statements
to which the different accounting policies have been applied.
3.3.5 An institution having any subsidiaries shall submit the following reports on both a
solo and consolidated basis:
a) Return CBK/PR3: Capital to Risk Weighted Assets;
b) Return CBK/PR4-3: Advances, bills discounted and other facilities to any
person or connected group exceeding 25 Percent of Core Capital;
c) Return CBK/PR4-4: Advances, bills discounted and other facilities to staff
members, shareholders, directors and their associates;
d) Large Exposures;
e) Liquidity Ratios;
451

f) Exposures to related parties and
g) Lending limits.
3.4

Additional Reporting Requirements

3.4.1

The Central Bank shall, if it deems necessary, require an institution to submit a
copy of the latest annual audited financial statements of any or all associates,
significant shareholders, and subsidiaries, not later than (30th March) of the
year following the financial year to which such audited financial statements
refer.

3.4.2

The Central Bank shall, if it deems necessary require the institution to provide
updated information with respect to any or all significant shareholders in the
form set out in Second Schedule to the Guideline on Licensing of New
Institutions (CBK/PG/01).

3.4.3

In addition to the reporting specified in this guideline, the Central Bank may
require institutions to submit any information in respect of their associates,
significant shareholders and subsidiaries in order that the Central Bank may be
satisfied that the operations and affairs of such companies or persons are not
detrimental to the safety and soundness of the institution concerned and are in
compliance with the Act.

3.4.4

The Central Bank may determine which entities are to be included in the
consolidation for the purposes of meeting the requirements of this guideline,
and may require for supervisory purposes consolidated financial information,
including a partial consolidation of the institution and such subsidiaries and
associates of the bank within or outside Kenya as the Central Bank may
specify, which may differ from the consolidation required under International
Financial Reporting Standards.

PART IV:
4.1

PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS

Capital Adequacy

4.1.1 When the Central Bank determines that an institution has insufficient capital to
shield against the risks arising from its group relationships, pursuant to Section 18
of the Act and the Capital Adequacy Guideline, the Central Bank shall require
higher minimum capital ratios for the institution.

452

4.1.2 Members of the banking group are required to maintain the capital adequacy ratios
prescribed by their respective regulators and ensure minimum capital requirements
are complied with on a solo and consolidated basis. In case of any shortfall in the
capital adequacy ratio of any of the subsidiaries, the parent should maintain capital
in addition to its own regulatory requirements to cover the shortfall.
4.1.3 Large Exposures: - As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and
avoidance of concentration of credit risks, the institutions in a banking group
should, in addition to adherence to prudential limits on solo basis, also adhere to
Single & Group borrower exposure limits on a consolidated basis.
4.1.4 Liquidity Ratios: - The existing liquidity requirements applicable to institutions on
a solo basis are extended to the banking group as well. If the related entities in the
group are banking institutions, liquidity position will be monitored on a consolidated
basis after netting out intra-group transactions and exposures. If the related entities
in the banking group are heterogeneous comprising non-banking entities, compliance
would be restricted to the banking entities on a consolidated basis. In respect of nonbanking financial entities within bank groups, each should comply with its solo
liquidity requirements.
4.1.5 Market Risk Exposure: - Institutions should ensure that potential risk of loss
arising from price risk, interest rate risk or foreign exchange rate fluctuations to the
institution’s capital base are within group tolerance level and prudential limits. The
limits applicable to institution on a solo basis such as the foreign exchange risk
exposure (net open forex exposure), single currency and intra-day foreign exchange
exposure, are also extended to the banking group.
4.1.6 Cross Border Visits: - CBK may from time to time where it deems necessary and
in coordination with the host supervisor, visit the foreign offices / operations of a
member of the banking group. The location and frequency will be determined by the
risk profile and systemic importance of the foreign operations.
4.2

Other Prudential Standards

4.2.1 If an institution with subsidiaries exceeds the single borrower limits and restrictions
on facilities to insiders on a consolidated basis, the Central Bank shall in recognition of the
risks and pursuant to Section 18 of the Act and the Capital Adequacy Guideline prescribe
such higher capital adequacy requirements for that institution as may be required to ensure
compliance with the prudential limits on a consolidated basis.

453

PART V: REMEDIAL MEASURES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS
5.1

Remedial measures
If an institution fails to comply with this guideline, the Central Bank may pursue
any or all corrective sanctions and or actions as provided for under the Act.

5.2

Administrative sanctions
In addition to the use of Remedial measures noted in 5.1 above, the Central Bank
may pursue any or all of the following administrative sanctions against an
institution, its board of directors and its officers:

a) Prohibition from engaging in any further foreign exchange activities;
b) Prohibition from declaring or paying dividends;
c) Prohibition from establishing new branches, subsidiaries, agents or
introducing new products;
d) Prohibition from engaging in new activities or from expanding existing
activities;
e) Suspension of access to Central Bank credit facilities;
f) Suspension of lending, investment, and credit granting operations;
g) Prohibition from acquiring, through purchase or lease, additional fixed
assets;
h) Prohibition from accepting further deposits or other lines of credit;
i) Prohibition from declaring or paying bonuses, salary incentives, severance
packages, management fees or other discretionary compensation to
directors or officers.
j) Limit the range of activities the consolidated group may conduct and the
locations in which such activities can be conducted (including the closing of
foreign offices). If it is determined that;
i. The safety and soundness of the bank and banking group is
compromised because the activities expose the bank or banking
group to excessive risk and/or are not properly managed;
ii. The supervision by other supervisors is not adequate relative to the
risk the activities present.
iii. The exercise of effective supervision on a consolidated basis is
hindered.

PART I: PRELIMINARY
1.1

Title - Guideline on stress testing.

1.2

Authorization - This Guideline is issued under Section 33(4) of the Banking Act, which
empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue guidelines to be adhered to by institutions
in order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial system.

1.3

Application - This Guideline applies to all institutions licensed under the Banking Act
(cap 488).

1.4

Definitions – the terms used in this guideline are as defined in the Banking Act (cap 488).
Other terms used in this guideline shall be taken to have the meaning assigned to them
hereunder.
‚Stress Testing‛ is a risk management technique used to evaluate the potential effect on
an institution’s financial condition of a specific event and/or movement in a set of financial
variables. The traditional focus of stress testing relates to the exceptional but plausible
events.
‚Credit Risk‛ is the risk that a counter party (for example, individuals, corporations,
sovereign governments), fails to meet their obligations. Many different types of
obligations are covered (from simple personal overdrafts to complex derivative
transactions).
‚Exposure at default‛ (EAD) it is defined as the gross exposure under a credit facility
upon the default of an obligor
‚Probability of default‛ (PD) it is the probability a borrower will default over a one
year time horizon
‚Loss Given Default‛ (LGD). it is the extent of credit loss when a borrower defaults. It
is defined as (1 minus recovery rate)
‚Market Risk‛ is the risk to an institution’s financial condition resulting from adverse
movements in market variables, such as prices or interest rates.
‚Interest Rate Risk‛ is the risk to an institution’s earnings and capital arising from
adverse movements in interest rates.
‚Repricing Risk‛ repricing risk arises due to pricing mismatches between assets and
liabilities of a bank. Assets may be priced at fixed rates while liabilities may be on
floating rate. If the rate of change in interest for fixed assets is not the same with that for
liabilities, then repricing risk will result.
458

‚Yield curve Risk‛ arises when unanticipated shifts in the yield curve have an adverse
effect on bank’s income and capital.
‚Basis Risk‛ arises when assets and liabilities are priced using different market
outcomes. Assets may be priced off the interbank rate while liabilities may be priced off
Treasury bill rate. If there is change in the spread between the interbank and T bill rate a
bank will be subject to a basis risk.
‚Liquidity Risk‛ is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they
fall due.
PART II: STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1.

Purpose - The purpose of this guideline is to provide institutions with minimum
requirements for developing stress testing mechanisms as a part of their overall risk
management systems and frameworks.

2.2.

Scope – Stress tests cover a range of methodologies and their complexity can vary,
ranging from simple sensitivity tests, which are aimed at assessing the impact of severe
macroeconomic stress event on measures like earnings and capital.

2.3.

Responsibility
Stress testing requirements are an integral component of an institution’s business planning
and risk management framework. Therefore, it is the responsibility of senior management
and the board to ensure appropriate stress tests are incorporated in its strategic plans.
Senior management should establish the Stress Testing framework and maintain an
effective oversight in the process by agreeing on the assumptions and reviewing the
results.

PART III: ROLE OF BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT
3.1.

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the overall stress testing and should be aware of
the key findings of the stress test. The board must ensure that its senior management has
in place a fit for purpose stress testing program that is enterprise wide and that
management has adopted policies requiring use of stress testing as a management tool.

3.2.

The management has a critical role in implementing stress testing in the institution’s risk
management. This calls for taking ownership of the overall framework, identifying
potential stress scenarios, taking remedial measures or actions (where warranted), given
the institution’s risk appetite and business strategy. Remedial measures or actions are
imperative since much of the value in stress testing is derived from internal discussion of
which stress scenarios imply the greatest vulnerability.
459

PART IV: INTRODUCTION
4.1.

Overview and Objective of the Guideline
The primary objective of the ‚Guideline on Stress Testing’ (the Guideline) is to reinforce
the importance of stress testing as a risk management tool. The guideline provides
guidance and principles on the critical areas pertaining to stress testing as well as specific
requirements that are expected of institutions.

4.2.

Principles for Banks

4.2.1. Stress testing should form an integral part of the overall governance and risk
management culture of the bank. Stress testing should be actionable, with the results
from stress testing analysis impacting decision making at the appropriate management
level, including strategic business decisions of the board and senior management.
Board and senior management involvement in the stress testing programme is
essential for its effective operation.
4.2.2. A bank should operate a stress testing programme that promotes risk identification
and control; provides a complementary risk perspective to other risk management
tools; improves on capital and liquidity management; and enhances internal and
external communication.
4.2.3. Stress testing programmes should take account of views from across the organization
and should cover a range of perspectives and techniques.
4.2.4. A bank should have written policies and procedures governing the stress testing
programme. The operation of the programme should be appropriately documented.
4.2.5. A bank should have a suitably robust infrastructure in place, which is sufficiently
flexible to accommodate different and possibly changing stress tests at an appropriate
level of granularity.
4.2.6. A bank should regularly maintain and update its stress testing framework. The
effectiveness of the stress testing programme, as well as the robustness of major
individual components, should be assessed regularly and independently.
4.2.7. Stress tests should cover a range of risks and business areas, including at firm-wide
level. A bank should be able to integrate effectively, in a meaningful fashion, across
the range of stress testing activities to deliver a complete picture of the firm-wide
risk.
4.2.8. Stress testing programmes should cover a range of scenarios, including forwardlooking scenarios, and aim to take into account system-wide interactions and feedback
effects.
4.2.9. As part of an overall stress testing programme, a bank should aim to take account of
simultaneous pressures in funding and asset markets, and the impact of a reduction on
market liquidity on exposure valuation.
4.2.10. The effectiveness of risk mitigating techniques should be systematically challenged.
460

PART V: APPROACH TO STRESS TESTS BY INSTITUTIONS
5.1.

Coverage and Risk Factors

5.1.1 Stress tests should be designed to take into account large movements in the risk
factors. Stress tests should reflect exceptional but plausible events and take into
account new concentrations of risks that may emerge, contagion effect and failure of
hedging techniques. Exceptional events would be fairly rare and have a large
magnitude or impact on the portfolio to be stress tested. Plausible events cannot be too
extreme that no entity could withstand such a shock or have zero probability of
occurring.
5.1.2 In addition, institutions also need to derive the risk drivers of these material risks as
this would assist in understanding the underlying factors that affect the risks and
determine the appropriate remedial measures. The number of risk factors to be
stressed will depend on the complexity of the portfolio and the risks faced by the
institutions. Nevertheless, licensed institutions should be able to justify their choice of
factors stressed.
5.1.3 Among the risk factors that institutions should consider when constructing the stress
tests would be:








Macroeconomic factors (interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation, GDP growth,
unemployment rate, asset prices);
Geographical and political factors (health of other economies, vulnerabilities to external
events, contagion effects);
Financial market conditions (liquidity);
Concentration risks (borrowers, industries, regions);
Borrower risk characteristics that would affect obligor risks and increase the default
probabilities (for example, borrower type, demographics, industry);
Transaction risk characteristics (product, collateral type, loan to value ratio, guarantees);
and
Other category of risks such as operational risk.

The stress tests should also reflect the specific risk characteristics of the institutions including
events such as mergers or strategic acquisitions.
5.2

Frequency

5.2.1. The frequency of stress testing should be determined in accordance with the nature of
the risks which the institutions are exposed to and the types of tests performed. Thus,
461

stress tests may be run on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly basis,
depending on the nature of the portfolio and risks as well as circumstances.
5.2.2. Stress tests should be produced regularly enough to take account of changing market
conditions and the institution’s changing risk profile. Generally, the trading portfolio
would be subject to more frequent stress testing. Similarly, in times of greater
volatility and unstable market conditions, more stress testing would be conducted.
5.2.3. However under specific circumstances, ad-hoc stress tests may also be required to
assess the impact of observed deterioration which licensed institutions had not taken
into account or to assess the impact of similar stress across the industry.
5.3

Magnitude of Shock

5.3.1. Institutions may vary the level of stress to assess its vulnerability under different
scenarios. Accordingly, institutions would need to determine the magnitude of shocks
to be administered.
5.3.2. Selecting the worst movement in the previous one-year period may not be optimal as
the period may not include any stressful event. The time interval should include at
least one business cycle (appropriate to the portfolio).
5.3.3. The magnitude of the shock used should be greater than the conservative estimate of
potential losses over the business cycle. It is more than the adverse market movement
(point of worst movement) relevant to the long-term risk profile of the specific
portfolio.
5.3.4. The shocks should have some reference to but not be bound by historical events nor
be so large that the exercise becomes purely hypothetical. The scenarios should be
forward looking and also have some relevance to the current events or circumstances.
5.4

Stress Testing Methodologies

5.4.1




Stress Testing For Credit Risk

Credit risk is measured by measuring potential losses that are dependent on the obligor’s
ability and willingness to repay credit. There is no single indicator for credit risk since it
cannot be measured directly. Hence, it is measured indirectly through the credit risk
drivers namely Exposure, Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and
Maturity.
Credit stress tests measures the impact on the institution’s asset quality and financial
position arising from the impairment of the borrowers’ creditworthiness during stress
condition. Stress test by definition measures the effect of only large moves (shocks) in
risk factors that would affect the obligor’s business operations and income. For stress test
purposes, such shocks should be ‘exceptional but plausible’. As elaborated earlier, there
are two approaches to decide on the appropriate magnitude of shock; the shocks that
actually occurred during historical stress episodes and shocks based on subjective
462



judgment. When using historical episodes, the size of the shock can be based on the most
adverse movement in the risk factor during the period of the stress event.
Similar to the measurement of credit risk under normal conditions, credit risk under
stress condition could stem from both on- and off-balance sheet activities and, for banks,
from both the banking and trading books.

5.4.2

Stress Testing For Market Risk
Stress testing should, as far as possible, be conducted on an institution-wide basis, and
should take into account the effect of unusual changes in prices or volatilities, market
liquidity, changes in historical correlations and assumptions in stressed market
conditions, the vulnerability to historically worst case scenarios and the default of a
large counter-party.

i)






Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of a licensed institution’s financial condition to adverse
movements in interest rates arising from four main sources namely repricing risk, basis
risk and yield curve risk.
Institutions can apply risk measurement techniques such as gap analysis, duration
analyses, income simulation or other interest rate risk model in performing stress test for
the banking and trading books.
The main step in performing the stress test is to specify the nature of the shocks to
be applied. For interest rate risk, the simplest forms of shock are a parallel shift
in the yield curve, a change in slope of the yield curve and a change in the spread
between different interest rates with the same time horizon. Parallel shifts in the
yield curve - stress the extreme movement in interest across the maturity
spectrum, for example, the effects on the licensed institution’s profitability of a
200 or 300 basis-point (bp) shifts in the interest rates.
At the very basic level, institutions can apply gap analysis to measure the level of interest
rate risk exposure in the banking book. The gap in each time band can be multiplied by
various scaling factors to calculate the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates.
For example, the average interest rate or yield on assets and liabilities in each time band
can be calculated and applied to the gap as a way of scaling the change in net interest
income.

ii) Foreign Exchange Risk


Foreign exchange risk is the risk that exchange rate changes can affect the value of a
institution’s assets and liabilities, as well as off-balance sheet items. It can be direct that
is, where the licensed institution takes or holds a position in foreign currency or indirect
that is, where a foreign position taken by one of the institution’s borrowers or
counterparties may affect their creditworthiness.
463













The most commonly used measure of foreign exchange is the institution’s net open
position and the net open position in each currency can be stressed against variations in
the exchange rate of a particular currency.
If the overwhelming majority of foreign exchange exposure is in one currency,
institutions may use either the net open position by currency or the aggregated net open
position. The latter may be necessary if a breakdown by currency is not available.
Institutions are also subject to indirect foreign exchange risk, that is, foreign exchange
risk incurred by the institution’s borrowers that can be transmitted to the institutions
through credit risk. In order to assess the indirect foreign exchange risk, it is necessary
to stress the major borrowers of the institutions and then estimate the impact on the loan
portfolio.
The basic type of shock to be used in all stress tests is a shock to the exchange rate
itself. Depending on their relevance to the institutions, one or more exchange rates will
have to be shocked either separately (sensitivity analysis) or simultaneously (scenario
analysis).
Institutions should incorporate past experience of financial crisis where the domestic
currency suffered sharp depreciation into the stress test in order to assess the impact of
the current portfolio.
The following is a common scenario that institutions can take into consideration when
performing stress testing for foreign exchange risk:
Adverse changes in exchange rates between major currencies ” this estimates the
impact on the licensed institution’s net open position on major currencies. In
addition, institutions may assess the impact of such changes on their major
customers with substantial foreign exchange exposures.

5.4.3 Stress Test for Liquidity Risk









There are two types of liquidity risk namely asset liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk.
Asset liquidity risk refers to the inability to conduct a transaction at current market prices
because of the size of the transaction. Funding liquidity risk refers to the inability to
access sufficient funds to meet payment obligations in a timely manner.
In many cases of bank failure, illiquidity occurs after the institutions have become
insolvent. Thus, the lack of adequate funding liquidity is considered to be a key sign that
the institutions are in serious financial difficulties.
Commonly, institutions face liquidity pressures from imbalances between the maturity
dates on their assets and liabilities, where cash inflows from assets may not match the
cash outflows to cover liabilities.
Interest rate changes can also lead to liquidity problems where high interest rates may
cause liquidity withdrawals as depositors seek higher returns elsewhere.
Institutions should include the following scenarios when performing liquidity stress test:
Liquidity crisis - assess the adequacy of its short-term liquidity to meet crisis
situations such as significant deposit outflows. In assessing the impact on the
institution’s funding and cash flow projections, institutions may adopt behavioral
464

-

5.5

assumptions for borrowers and depositors such as increase in depositor
withdrawal rate.
Credit tightening - stress the impact of credit and counterparty lines tightening and
estimate and anticipate alternative funding costs and sources in a difficult market
environment due to the downgrading of an institution’s rating. Then determine
how it would affect the current business and the pricing and competitiveness of
future business.
Reporting of Stress Test Results to the Central Bank of Kenya
It is expected that institutions will conduct several different stress tests in terms of
scenarios and frequency. However, the reporting to Central Bank will be required for
two scenarios only that is, the latest stress test conducted by the institutions using an
exceptional but plausible event scenario and a worst case scenario, based on the
minimum requirements. Institutions are required to submit the stress test results to the
Central Banks’ Bank Supervision Department by the 10th day after end of each quarter.
The submission should cover the following:

5.5.1 Coverage
 A description of the risk areas being subjected to stress tests.
 Conditions prevailing and assumptions used for the stress test. Institutions are required to
describe the event as well as give details of the conditions prevailing in each scenario
such as the level of GDP, interest rates, unemployment, concentration in properties.
Institutions should also include any other significant assumptions used in the stress tests.
5.5.2 Results of Latest Stress Test
The results of the stress test to be reported as indicated in Table 1 below and should
include, at a minimum, the impact on the profitability, capital and asset quality at end of
each reporting quarter. Both absolute amounts and key financial ratios should be
reported. Other indicators and ratios may be included by the institution if deemed useful.

PRELIMINARY

1.1

Title - Guideline on Prompt Corrective Action.

1.2

Application - All institutions licensed under the Banking Act (Cap.488).

1.3

Authorization - This Guideline is issued under Sections 33 and 34 of the Banking Act,
which empowers the Central Bank of Kenya to issue Guidelines to be adhered to by
institutions in order to maintain a stable and efficient banking and financial system.

1.4

Definitions ” Terms used in this regulation are as defined in the Banking Act.

‚Banking Act‛ means the Banking Act as amended from time to time
‚CAMELS‛ refers to an acronym for Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Liquidity
and Sensitivity to Market Risk‛.
‚Capital Restoration Plan‛ means a plan to restore the institution to capital adequacy pursuant
to Section 18 of the Banking Act, or in the case of issues unrelated to capital such as violations
of the law or regulations, a plan to resolve all deficiencies to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.
A capital restoration plan can be implemented voluntarily by an institution under the oversight of
its board of directors or, its implementation can be mandated by the Central Bank.
‚Capital Compliant ‚An institution will be considered to be capital compliant if it fully meets
the capital requirements fully stipulated in Section 18 of the Banking Act.
‚Final Agreement‛ means an agreement made between the Central Bank and a significantly
undercapitalized institution’s board of directors for the purpose of recapitalizing the institution in
a timely manner.

PART II STATEMENT OF POLICY
2.1

Purpose – This Guideline has been prepared pursuant to sections 33, 33A and 34 of
the Banking Act to assist institutions that are facing difficulties to take prompt
corrective action so as to avoid failure or instability in the banking sector.

2.2

Scope - This guideline shall apply to all institutions licensed to transact business under
the Banking Act. It highlights the corrective actions that can be taken depending on the
extent of the difficulties an institution is experiencing. This is meant to restore the
financial condition of the institution and protect the interests of depositors from
systemic risks.

2.3

Responsibility ” It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and Senior
Management to ensure that the provisions of this guideline are adhered to by the
institution and to ascertain that the affected institution improves its capital position,
management, an /or business methods.

PART III BACKGROUND
3.1

Prompt Corrective Action
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) is a framework of supervisory actions of increasingly
severe enforcement actions that are applied to institutions that regularly violate laws
and regulations, fail to meet prudential guidelines or regulations or in some other way
operate in an unsafe and unsound manner. These actions become increasingly severe as
469

an institution falls within lower capital categories. Some supervisory actions associated
with prompt corrective action are mandatory; that is, the actions immediately apply to
the institution as it is classified in a particular category. Other supervisory actions
associated with prompt corrective action are not mandatory as they are imposed by the
Central Bank of Kenya through a series of remedial actions to be taken by an
institution to address problems while they are still of a magnitude that can be managed.
An institution shall be subject to PCA whenever any or all of the following conditions
occur:
(1) When it fails to meet the capital requirements prescribed under section 18 and / or
the second schedule (Section 7) of the Banking Act;
(2) The CAMELS composite rating is less than ‚3‛ and Management component
rating of less than ‚3‛;
(3) A serious supervisory concern has been identified that places the institution at
more than normal risk of failure in the opinion of the CBK. Such concerns could
include, but are not limited, to any one or a combination of the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)

Finding of unsafe and unsound activities that could adversely affect the
interest of depositors and/or creditors;
A finding of repeat violations of law or the continuing failure to comply with
CBK Directives; and
Significant reporting errors that materially misrepresent the institution’s
financial condition.

(4) The institution’s overall composite risk rating is high while the quality of risk
management is weak.
3.2

The purpose of enforcing PCA is to ensure that institutions under the purview of the
Central Bank of Kenya:
(a) Comply with the Banking Act, regulations and guidelines issued thereunder.
(b) Conduct business in a safe, sound & authorized manner thus enhancing the
efficiency of the financial sector.
(c) Maintain a sound financial condition.
(d) Protect reputation, solvency, interests of depositors, banking system, and the
Public.
(e) Reduce dependence on the regulator for bailouts.
(f) Provides effective supervisory remedies that minimize losses to the Deposit
Protection Fund now the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC).

3.3

Supervision of Institutions
3.3.1 The Central Bank supervises all banks, financial institutions, and mortgage
finance institutions (together, ‚institutions‛) in Kenya using both off-site and
on-site supervisory methods, meetings with management, and its powers of
enforcement.
3.3.2 The CBK conducts off-site supervision which entails applying financial
monitoring and analysis techniques, including financial soundness indicators
which are based on the CAMELS bank rating system.
3.3.3 On-site examinations of institutions is conducted in order to appraise the quality
and competence of an institution’s management and attain an in-depth
understanding of the risk profile and operations of an institution.
3.3.4 Meetings may be held with management and/or the board of directors as
deemed necessary based on results of off-site financial monitoring or at the
conclusion of each on-site examination or for any other supervisory reason.

PART IV SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

all times adheres to the prescribed requirements for capital adequacy as set out Under Section
18 and the second schedule of the Banking Act and the relevant prudential and risk management

Supervisory Actions

4.2.2.1

Once the Memorandum of Understanding has been signed, throughout the period that
it is in effect, the Central Bank will continue to monitor the institution, using
specialized reporting and off-site surveillance. The regular annual on-site examination
shall be supplemented with periodic interim examinations that target the institution’s
specific problem areas and verify the institution’s adherence to the provisions of the
Memorandum of Understanding.

4.2.2.2

If the institution’s financial condition continues to deteriorate in spite of the increased
supervisory attention, then additional action may be taken as the Central Bank may
deem fit. Either the Memorandum of Understanding could be amended to strengthen
its provisions, or a PCA Order be issued to the institution.

4.2.2.3

On a consecutive on-site examination, an institution should be assigned a composite
rating of ‚4,‛ instead of a ‚3,‛ when:
473

4.3.

a)

A Memorandum of Understanding has not been adopted as requested by the
Central Bank;

b)

A Memorandum of Understanding has been adopted but not complied with,
including the failure of the institution to meet any target, adopt any measure, or
report any result in the time frame required; and/or

c)

significantly deteriorated since the previous examination.

For Institutions rated ‚Marginal‛
CAMELS Composite Rating = 4; and/or Undercapitalized

4.3.1.

Assign a Resolution Specialist
The Central Bank will assign a Resolution Specialist to the institution. A Resolution
Specialist is an official of CBK who is designated to supervise marginal and
unsatisfactory institutions.

4.3.2

Determine whether the institution is Viable
The Resolution Specialist will make an initial determination as to whether the
institution is ‚viable.‛ An institution shall be deemed to be ‚viable‛ if it meets all of
the prescribed criteria outlined in Section 1.4. An institution that does not meet the
prescribed criteria shall be found to be non-viable shall be rated ‚unsatisfactory‛ or
‚5‛ for the purposes of using the Central Bank’s powers of enforcement as outlined in
Section 4.5.

4.3.3

Develop a Supervisory Strategy
As soon as the institution receives a rating of ‚4‛ (or ‚5) and is deemed to be ‚viable,
CBK will develop a supervisory strategy. The supervisory strategy will require the
institution to:
 resolve its problems,
 restores the institution through prompt corrective action to financial and managerial
health, and
 enforces compliance with the Banking Act, regulations, and directives of the
Central Bank.

4.3.4

Issue a PCA Order
In accordance with the provisions stipulated in Sections 33 and 34 of the Banking Act,
the Central Bank of Kenya, will issue a PCA Order to the institution and/or one or
474

more individual persons, including a director, officer, employee, significant
shareholder, associate, or other person. The order will specify:
4.3.4.1 The target(s) of the Order, either:



The institution; and/or
One or more individual persons, including a director, officer, employee,
significant shareholder, associate, or other person.

4.3.4.2 The legal ground(s) on which the Central Bank is enforcing compliance:




The institution or person conducts its business in a manner contrary to the
provisions of the Banking Act or of any regulations made there under or any other
Act.
The institution or person conducts its business in a manner detrimental to, or not
in the best interests of, its depositors or members of the public.
The institution is undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized

4.3.4.3

The actions and violations from which the institution or person should cease.

4.3.4.4

State the affirmative actions which the institution or person should take to correct the
conditions at the institution.

4.3.4.5

the institution, order the suspension or removal from office in the institution any
person who has engaged in, or is about to engage in, or is otherwise responsible for,
the actions or violations that are the basis of the order or for violations of or noncompliance with a Memorandum of Understanding or order from the Central Bank.

4.3.4.6

Additional Measures
The Central Bank may in addition impose the following additional provisions which
the Banking Act requires the Central Bank to impose on undercapitalized institutions:
a)

Restrict, suspend or prohibit the payment of dividends by the institution.

b)

Prohibit the conversion of any profits of the institution into capital.

c)

Direct the suspension or removal of any officer involved in such conduct from the

Banking Act or, in the case of issues unrelated to capital, a plan to resolve all
deficiencies to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.

h)

Prohibit the institution from awarding any bonuses, or increments in salary,
emoluments, and other benefits to directors and officers of the institution.

i)

At the expense of the institution, appoint a person suitably qualified and
competent, in the opinion of the Central Bank, to advise and assist the institution
in designing and implementing a capital restoration plan or other corrective action
plan under paragraph (g). The person appointed shall regularly report to the
Central Bank on the progress of the plan.

j)

Impose restrictions on growth of assets or liabilities of the institution as it deems
fit.

k)

Restrict the rate of interest on savings and time deposits payable by the institution
to such rates as the Central Bank shall determine; or

l)

Order the institution to take such other actions that may be deemed necessary to
rectify a capital deficiency or other weakness.

4.3.4.7 If the institution is a member of a group, and if another member of that group (other
than the institution) is a cause (in whole or in part) of the actions or violations that are
the basis of the order or for violations of or non-compliance with a Memorandum of
Understanding or order from the Central Bank, the Central Bank may impose the
following measures:
●

●

●

Suspend any further investment by the institution in the affected company or
entity;
Suspend the exercise of a non-operating holding company’s control of the
institution; and/or
Suspend transactions between any associated entity and the institution.
476

4.3.4.8

The Central Bank may also set forth the institution’s reporting obligations to the
Central Bank regarding compliance with the Order and the Capital Restoration Plan. A

the supervisory strategy process).

4.3.4.9

In addition to the above corrective measures, the Central Bank may in addition assess
monetary penalties consistent with the requirements of The Banking
(Penalties) Regulations, 1999, Legal Notice No. 77/99.

4.4. Require a Capital Restoration Plan
The Central Bank may require an undercapitalized institution to present it with a
Capital Restoration Plan. The Capital Restoration Plan is a written document which
will outline the steps that the institution will take to become adequately capitalized.
4.4.1 Appoint a Management Advisor
For undercapitalized institutions, and for institutions with a composite CAMELS rating
of ‚4‛ (or ‚5‛) for reasons other than undercapitalization, the Central Bank of Kenya
will appoint a Management Advisor to advise and assist the institution in designing and
implementing the Capital Restoration Plan and other plans for corrective action.
Institutions should note that the actual role of a Management Advisor will vary
between institutions depending upon the particular needs and problems of those
institutions. The terms-of-reference for the position would be customized on a case-bycase basis. In a situation where an institution’s problems are isolated and its underlying
financial soundness is not threatened, then the terms-of-reference for the Management
Advisor appointed to it may be quite short and include only a few responsibilities.
4.4.2
4.4.2.1

Require the Board of Directors and Senior Management to be strengthened
The Central Bank may direct that the board of directors and management of an
institution should be strengthened by adding new persons who are experienced with the
particular problems confronted by the institution, with other business work-outs, or
with other experience deemed relevant. All persons so appointed should be deemed
professionally and morally suitable to hold such positions and their appointment should
be subject to the approval of the Central Bank.

4.4.2.2 In very urgent and serious cases and when the Board of Directors is unwilling, unable,
or slow to act, the Central Bank may suspend or remove and replace the following
persons. A person who:

477

(1) capital and financial condition;
(2) compliance with the PCA Order; and
(3) implementation of, and adherence to, the Capital Restoration Plan.
(4) The institution’s adherence to required time-frames and reporting requirements
shall be carefully monitored and enforced through follow-up action if necessary.

approval prior to making certain investments, including those above a certain amount,
or enter into some other transaction.

4.4.2.9

When the results obtained from the Resolution Specialist’s off-site monitoring and
from subsequent on-site examinations of the institution warrant, the Central Bank shall
recommend updates, revisions, and more stringent enforcement measures to the
supervisory strategy and order.

4.4.2.10 When there is reasonable cause to believe that: (1) the Board of Directors and/or
officers of an institution are unwilling or unable to effect compliance with, or to
continue to operate pursuant to, the provisions of the order and/or Capital Restoration
Plan; or (2) the institution has become, or is expected to become within six months,
significantly undercapitalized, then the institution shall be rated ‚5‛ (unsatisfactory)
and be made subject to the provisions of Section 34 of the Banking Act, ‚Powers of
the Central Bank to Intervene in Management.‛
4.5. For Institutions Rated ‚Unsatisfactory‛


assigned one at this time.

4.5.1.2

For an institution that was previously rated ‚3‛ and is rated ‚5‛subject to a
Memorandum of Understanding shall be assigned to a Resolution Specialist. The

Central Bank.

4.5.1.3

Issue, or Strengthen, PCA Order to the Institution

4.5.1.4

In the case of an undercapitalized institution that has remained stable with a ‚5‛ rating
while registering no significant improvement in its capital position, or in the case of a
5-rated institution which has been downgraded from a previous ‚4‛ rating., the
Central Bank shall re-assess both the supervisory strategy (including the order) and the
479

abilities and attitude of the institution’s Board of Directors and officers. Some of the
factors to be considered in carrying out this assessment include the following;
 Whether the provisions of the Order should be strengthened or new provisions be
added.
 Whether the provisions of the Capital Restoration Plan should be amended.
 Whether any officer should be removed or suspended from office.
 Whether any other employee should be terminated.
 Whether any new competent person(s), familiar with the business of institutions,
should be appointed to its board of directors.
 Whether the responsibilities of the Management Advisor should be revised or
expanded.

include an unconscionable or unreasonable term in an agreement;

(vi)

exert undue influence or duress on a consumer to enter into a transaction;

reasonable basis to conclude that any commercial purpose may prove to be
successful, if the consumer has such a purpose in applying for the credit; or

provide the product, advice or service.
(iv) The remuneration structure for staff of institutions should be designed to encourage
responsible business conduct, fair treatment of consumers and to avoid conflicts of
interest. The remuneration structure should be disclosed to customers where appropriate,
such as when potential conflicts of interest cannot be managed or avoided.
