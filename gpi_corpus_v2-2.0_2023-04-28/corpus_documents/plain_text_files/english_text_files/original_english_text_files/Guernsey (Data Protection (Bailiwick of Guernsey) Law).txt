the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017 and requested the Bailiff to
present a most humble Petition to Your Majesty in Council praying for Your Royal

graciously pleased to sanction the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law,
2017, and to order that it shall have force of law in the Bailiwick of Guernsey.
“The Committee have considered the Projet de Loi and have agreed to report
that it may be advisable for Your Majesty to approve and ratify it”.
Her Majesty, having taken the report into consideration, was pleased, by and
with the advice of Her Privy Council, to approve and ratify the Projet de Loi (a copy

accordingly.

PROJET DE LOI
ENTITLED

The Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017
THE STATES, in pursuance of their Resolution of the 26th April, 2017a, have
approved the following provisions which, subject to the Sanction of Her Most
Excellent Majesty in Council, shall have force of law in the Bailiwick of Guernsey.

PART I
PRELIMINARY

Object of this Law.
1.

The object of this Law is to –

(a)

protect the rights of individuals in relation to their personal
data, and provide for the free movement of personal data, in a
manner equivalent to the GDPR and the Law Enforcement
Directive, and

(b)

make other provisions considered appropriate in relation to
the processing of personal data.

_____________________________________________________________________
a

Article VI of Billet d'État No. VIII of 2017.

10

Application.
2.

(1)

This Law applies in relation to the processing of personal data

only where conditions A and B are satisfied.

(2)

Condition A is that –

(a)

the processing is wholly or partly by automated means,
or

(b)

if the processing is other than by automated means, the
personal data forms or is intended to form part of a
filing system.

(3)

Condition B is that –

(a)

the processing is in the context of a controller or
processor established in the Bailiwick, or

(b)

the personal data is that of a Bailiwick resident, and it is
processed in the context of –

(i)

the offering of goods or services (whether or not
for payment) to the resident, or

(ii)

the monitoring of the resident's behaviour in the
Bailiwick.

(4)

Schedule 1 has effect.

11

(5)

In this section, "Bailiwick resident" means an individual who

is ordinarily resident in the Bailiwick.

Extent.
3.

Subject to section 2, this Law –

(a)

applies regardless of where the processing takes place,
and

(b)

has extra-territorial application unless the context
requires otherwise.

Exception for personal, family or household affairs.
4.

Nothing in this Law applies to the processing of personal data by an

individual solely for the purpose of the individual's personal, family or household
affairs (including recreational purposes).

Other enactments.
5.

So far as it is possible to do so, an enactment must be read and given

effect in a way which is consistent with this Law.

PART II
DUTIES AND PRINCIPLES OF PROCESSING

Duty to comply with data protection principles.
6.

(1)

A controller must –

12

(a)

ensure that the processing of all personal data in
relation to which the person is the controller complies
with the data protection principles in subsection (2)(a)
to (f), and

(b)

(2)

comply with the principle in subsection (2)(g).

The data protection principles are –

(a)

Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency:
Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in
a transparent manner in relation to the data subject,

(b)

Purpose Limitation:
Personal data:

(i)

must not be collected except for a specific,
explicit and legitimate purpose, and

(ii)

once collected, must not be further processed in
a manner incompatible with the purpose for
which it was collected,

(c)

Minimisation:
Personal data processed must be adequate, relevant
and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
purpose for which it is processed,

(d)

Accuracy:

13

Personal data processed must be accurate and where
applicable, kept up to date, and reasonable steps must
be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate
(having regard to the purpose for which it is processed)
is erased or corrected without delay,

(e)

Storage Limitation:
Personal data must not be kept in a form that permits
identification of the data subject any longer than is
necessary for the purpose for which it is processed (but
may be stored longer to the extent necessary for a
historical or scientific purpose),

(f)

Integrity and Confidentiality:
Personal data must be processed in a manner that
ensures its security appropriately, including protecting
it against unauthorised or unlawful processing and
against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures, and

(g)

Accountability:
The controller is responsible for, and must be able to
demonstrate, compliance with the data protection
principles in paragraphs (a) to (f).

Lawfulness of processing.
7.

For the purposes of the data protection principle of Lawfulness,

Fairness and Transparency, processing of personal data is lawful only if, and to the
extent that –

14

(a)

in the case of special category data, at least one
condition in Part II or III of Schedule 2 is satisfied, and

(b)

in any other case, at least one condition in Part I or II of
Schedule 2 is satisfied.

Fairness of processing.
8.

(1)

For the purposes of the data protection principle of

Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency –

(a)

subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), whether or not
personal data is processed fairly must be determined
having regard to the method by which it is obtained,
including whether any person from whom it is
obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or
purposes for which it is to be processed,

(b)

personal data must be regarded as obtained fairly if it
consists of information obtained from a person who –

(i)

is authorised by or under any enactment to
supply it, or

(ii)

is required to supply it by or under any
enactment

or

any

international

agreement

imposing an international obligation on the
Bailiwick, and

15

(c)

the processing of personal data containing an identifier
of a prescribed kind or description must be regarded as
unfair unless the processing complies with any
conditions prescribed in relation to identifiers of that
kind or description.

(2)

In subsection (1)(c), "prescribed" means prescribed by an

Ordinance made under this Law.

Compatibility of further processing.
9.

(1)

This section applies for the purposes of the data protection

principle of Purpose Limitation, in relation to the requirement in section 6(2)(b)(ii)
that personal data, once collected, must not be further processed in a manner
incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected.

(2)

Subject to subsection (3), whether or not personal data is

further processed in a manner incompatible with the purpose for which it was
collected must be determined having regard to the proportionality factors.

(3)

Further processing of personal data is deemed to be

compatible with any purpose for which the data was collected, where –

(a)

the explicit consent of the data subject is obtained for
the further processing,

(b)

the further processing is for a historical or scientific
purpose, or

16

(c)

the further processing is specifically authorised or
required by an enactment.

Consent to processing.
10.

(1)

For the purposes of this Law, consent given by a data subject

means any specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's
wishes by which the data subject, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action,
signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject.

(2)

A data subject's consent to the processing of personal data is

not valid for the purposes of this Law except where the following conditions are
satisfied –

(a)

it is clearly demonstrable that the data subject has given
the consent,

(b)

the data subject has freely given the consent,

(c)

before the consent is given, the data subject is informed
that the data subject has the right to withdraw consent
at any time,

(d)

if the consent is given in writing in the context of other
matters (not involving consent to processing of the
personal data), the request for consent is -

(i)

presented in a manner which is clearly
distinguishable from the other matters,

17

(ii)

in an intelligible and easily accessible form,
and

(iii)

(e)

in clear and plain language,

if the consent is given in the context of the performance
of a contract (including by provision of a service) –

(i)

the consent was necessary for the performance
of the contract, or

(ii)

if it was not so necessary, the data subject was
given the option of refusing consent without
prejudice to the performance of the contract, and
advised of this option, and

(f)

if consent is given in the context of the offer of
information society services directly to a child under
13 years of age, the consent is given or authorised by a
person who has parental responsibility for the child.

(3)

A person determining whether the conditions in subsection

(2)(a) to (e) are satisfied in the context of consent given by a child must have regard
to the age of the child.

(4)

For the avoidance of doubt, a data subject's consent is not

freely given if it is given on the basis of false, deceptive or misleading information or
conduct, knowingly or recklessly provided or perpetrated by –

18

(a)

the controller,

(b)

the processor,

(c)

any other person who seeks the consent or to whom the
consent is given.

(5)

A data subject may withdraw the data subject's consent to

processing at any time, and the consent is treated as revoked from that time.

(6)

Where consent to processing is sought or given, the controller

must –

(a)

provide a procedure for withdrawal that is at least as
simple as the procedure for giving consent, and

(b)

make reasonable efforts to verify that the person giving
or authorising the consent is who that person claims to
be, particularly where that person claims to be the
person authorised to give or authorise consent for a
child under 13 years of age.

(7)

Consent to the processing of criminal data is not valid for the

purposes of this Law unless –

(a)

the controller to whom the data subject has given
consent –

19

(i)

is a person authorised or required by any
enactment to process the criminal data of any
person at the application or request of, or
otherwise with the consent of, the data subject,
or

(ii)

is a person authorised or required by any
enactment to apply to or request any person to
process that criminal data, or

(b)

otherwise provided by an Ordinance made under this
Law.

(8)

Nothing in this section affects the general law of contract,

including rules on validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child.

Anonymisation.
11.

(1)

Where personal data is anonymised –

(a)

nothing in this Law requires the controller to maintain,
acquire or process additional information solely in
order to comply with this Law, but

(b)

the controller must take reasonable steps to notify the
data subject of the anonymisation.

(2)

Part III of this Law does not apply to anonymised data unless

the data subject provides additional information to enable the anonymised data to be
identified with that data subject.

20

(3)

In this section, "anonymised", in relation to personal data,

means the personal data is manipulated or treated in such a manner that the
controller is not capable of identifying the data subject.

PART III
DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS

Data subject rights and corresponding duties of controllers

Right to information for personal data collected from data subject.
12.

(1)

This section applies where personal data is collected from the

data subject by –

(2)

(a)

the controller, or

(b)

a processor acting on the controller's behalf.

Where this section applies, the data subject has a right to be

given the following information in accordance with subsection (3) –

(a)

the information specified in Schedule 3, and

(b)

a statement as to –

(i)

whether the provision of the personal data by
the data subject is a statutory or contractual
requirement, or a requirement necessary to be
met in order to enter into a contract, and

21

(ii)

whether the data subject is obliged to provide
the

personal

data,

and

the

possible

consequences of failure to provide that personal
data.

(3)

The controller must give the data subject that information

before or at the time the personal data is collected from the data subject.

(4)

For the avoidance of doubt, the controller may give the data

subject that information wholly or partly using standardised icons, but any icon
presented electronically must be machine-readable.

Right to information for indirectly collected personal data.
13.

(1)

Where personal data processed in the context of a controller

has not been collected from the data subject by either the controller or a processor
acting on the controller's behalf, the data subject has a right to be given the
information specified in Schedule 3 in accordance with subsection (2).

(2)

The controller must give the data subject that information –

(a)

within a reasonable period of that personal data being
so

processed,

having

regard

to

the

specific

circumstances in which the personal data is so
processed, and

(b)

in any case, before or at the earliest occurrence of any of
the following times –

22

(i)

if the personal data is used for communication
with the data subject, the time of the first
communication with the data subject,

(ii)

if the personal data is disclosed to another
recipient, the time when the personal data is first
disclosed to any recipient, and

(iii)

the

expiry

of

one

month

following

the

processing of the personal data.

(3)

For the avoidance of doubt, the controller may give the data

subject that information wholly or partly using standardised icons, but any icon
presented electronically must be machine-readable.

(4)

Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) requires the controller to give

the data subject any information where –

(a)

the data subject already has the information,

(b)

the provision of the information is impossible or would
involve a disproportionate effort,

(c)

the provision of the information is likely to prejudice
the objectives of that processing,

(d)

the information or the personal data must be kept
confidential or secret in order to perform or comply
with any duty imposed by law on the controller, or

23

(e)

the collection of the personal data in the context of the
controller, or the disclosure of the personal data to the
controller, is required or authorised by the provisions
of an enactment other than this Law.

(5)

Where subsection (4)(b) applies, the controller must take

appropriate measures to protect the significant interests of the data subject, for
example by publishing a notice (without making public any personal data) or taking
any other equivalent step to inform the data subject in an equally effective manner.

Right to data portability.
14.

(1)

This section applies where –

(a)

a data subject has provided personal data relating to
the data subject ("relevant personal data") to a
controller ("the first controller"), directly or through a
processor,

(b)

the processing of the relevant personal data is based
wholly or partly on the data subject's consent to
processing or on the processing being necessary –

(i)

for the conclusion or performance of a contract –

(A)

to which the data subject is a party, or

24

(B)

made between the first controller and a
third party in the interest of the data
subject, or

(ii)

to take steps at the request of the data subject
prior to entering into such a contract,

(c)

the processing of the relevant personal data is not in
the context of a public authority exercising or
performing –

(d)

(i)

a function that is of a public nature, or

(ii)

a task carried out in the public interest, and

the processing of the relevant personal data is carried
out by automated means.

(2)

The data subject has a right –

(a)

to be given the relevant personal data in accordance
with subsection (3)(a), and

(b)

where the relevant personal data is given to the data
subject, to transmit that personal data to another
controller without hindrance from the first controller.

(3)

On request by the data subject, the first controller must –

25

(a)

give the data subject the relevant personal data in a
structured, commonly used and machine-readable
format, suitable for transmission to another controller,
and

(b)

transmit that personal data directly to another
controller specified by the data subject unless this is not
technically feasible.

(4)

Nothing in this section affects or limits section 21.

Right of access.
15.

(1)

An individual has a right to be given the following

information in accordance with subsections (2) to (4) –

(a)

confirmation as to whether or not personal data
relating to the individual is being processed in the
context of a controller, and

(b)

if personal data relating to the individual is being
processed in the context of a controller –

(i)

the information specified in Schedule 3,

(ii)

one copy of the personal data, and

(iii)

further copies of the personal data.

26

(2)

On request by an individual, the controller must give the

individual that information.

(3)

For the avoidance of doubt, the controller must give the

individual that information free of any charge, except in the case of the further
copies specified in subsection (1)(b)(iii), for which the controller may require the
payment of a reasonable charge for administrative costs.

(4)

Where an individual makes a request under this section to a

controller which is a credit reference agency, the request is to be regarded as limited
to a request concerning personal data relevant to the individual’s financial standing,
unless the request shows a contrary intention.

(5)

In subsection (4), "credit reference agency" means a person

carrying on business comprising the furnishing of persons with information relevant
to the financial standing of individuals, being information collected for that purpose.

Exception to right of portability or access involving disclosure of another
individual's personal data.
16.

(1)

This section applies where a controller cannot comply with a

request made by an individual ("the requestor") under section 14 or 15 without
disclosing information relating to another individual ("the other individual") who is
identified or identifiable from that information.

(2)

Despite any provision to the contrary in section 14 or 15, if it is

reasonable to do so in order to protect the significant interests of the other
individual, the controller must –

27

(a)

in the case of a request to be given that information,
refuse to give that information to the requestor, and

(b)

in the case of a request for transmission of that
information to another controller, refuse to so transmit
that information.

(3)

In determining whether it reasonable in accordance with

(1)

A controller or processor has a duty not to breach an operative

(2)

Where a controller or processor breaches the duty in

provision.

subsection (1), and the breach causes damage to another person ("the injured
party"), the breach is actionable in court by the injured party against the controller or
processor in the same manner and by the same remedies and other means as if the
controller or processor had committed the tort of breach of statutory duty against the
injured party.

123

(3)

damages) in respect of the breach of duty,

(b)

an injunction or interim injunction to restrain any
actual or anticipated breach of duty, and

Despite any rule of law to the contrary, a court in which an

action is brought may grant an order, relief or remedy of a kind mentioned in
subsection (3) in respect of any distress, inconvenience or other adverse effect
suffered by an injured party even if it does not result from any physical or financial
loss or damage.

(5)

This section replaces any action for the tort of breach of

statutory duty that may lie against a controller or processor in relation to the breach
or anticipated breach of an operative provision.

(6)

Except as otherwise provided by subsection (5), nothing in this

section affects or limits any other administrative, civil or other action, right, remedy
or relief that any person has or may have against a controller or processor.

124

Further provisions on liability.

A defendant in any action is exempt from liability for breach

of duty if the defendant proves that the defendant is not in any way responsible for
the damage that is the subject of the action.

A processor is exempt from liability for damages under any

action unless the processor –

(a)

has breached a provision of this Law specifically
imposing a duty on processors, or

(b)

has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions
given by the controller.

(3)

For the avoidance of doubt –

(a)

where both a controller and a processor, or more than
one controller or one processor, are involved in the

subject of the action, each controller and each processor
so involved is jointly and severally liable for the
damage concerned, and

(b)

where a controller or a processor ("A") has, in
accordance with paragraph (a), paid full compensation
for any damage, A is entitled to reimbursement from
each of the other controllers and processors ("B")
involved in that processing, for that part of the

125

for the damage concerned, subject to subsections (1)
and (2).

disciplinary offence) punishable by any measures under and in accordance with any
enactment, other than by way of criminal proceedings, and
"regulatory purpose" means –
(a)

prevention, investigation, detection, determination or punishment of
an administrative offence,

(b)

carrying

out

the

measures

administrative offence, or

imposed

as

punishment

of

an

250

(c)

determination by a public authority of an application for a
registration, licence, approval or any other kind of authorisation or
consent, in accordance with an enactment.

Part III
Wider Exemptions in the Public Interest
17.

Journalism, art, literature and academia.

(1)

Personal data processed only for the purpose of journalism or an artistic,
literary or academic purpose, is exempt from a provision of Part II, III, IV,
VII, IX, X, XI or XII or section 43 of this Law to the extent that –
(a)

the processing is undertaken with a view to the publication by any
person of any journalistic, artistic, literary or academic material,

(b)

the application of the provision to the personal data would be likely to
prejudice the purpose concerned in connection with the publication of
that material, and

(c)

having particular regard to the importance of freedom of expression
and information, the public interest in the publication of that material
outweighs the significant interests of the data subject.

(2)

For the avoidance of doubt, no power conferred by a provision of Part XI or
XII of this Law may be exercised in relation to personal data which by virtue
of subparagraph (1) is exempt from the provision concerned.

(3)

The States of Deliberation may by Ordinance make such further provision as
they consider necessary or expedient as to the balancing of the rights of data
subjects and the public interest in freedom of expression and information in
relation to the processing of personal data for a purpose mentioned in
subparagraph (1).

(4)

In subparagraph (1), "freedom of expression and information" means the
right protected under article 10 of the European Convention on Human

251

Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as incorporated in the Human Rights
(Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2000.

18.

Public security, etc.

(1)

Personal data is exempt from any provision of Parts II to XII or XV of this
Law to the extent that the application of the provision ("exemptable
provision") to the data would be likely to prejudice public security or the
security of the British Islands.

(2)

Subject to subparagraph (4), a certificate signed by Her Majesty's Procureur
certifying that exemption from one or more exemptable provisions specified
in the certificate is or at any time was required for the purposes of
subparagraph (1) in respect of any personal data is conclusive evidence of
that fact.

(3)

A certificate under subparagraph (2) –
(a)

may identify the personal data to which it applies by means of a
general description, and

(b)
(4)

may be expressed to have prospective effect.

Any person directly affected by the issuing of a certificate under
subparagraph (2) may appeal to the Royal Court against the certificate.

(5)

If on an appeal under subparagraph (4), the Royal Court finds that, applying
the principles applied by the court on an application for judicial review, Her
Majesty's Procureur did not have reasonable grounds for issuing the
certificate, the court may –

(6)

(a)

allow the appeal, and

(b)

quash the certificate.

Where in any proceedings under this Law it is claimed by a controller that a
certificate under subparagraph (2) which identifies the personal data to
which it applies by means of a general description applies to any personal

252

data, any other party to the proceedings may appeal to the Royal Court on
the ground that the certificate does not apply to the personal data in question.
(7)

But, subject to any determination under subparagraph (8), the certificate is to
be conclusively presumed so to apply.

(8)

On an appeal under subparagraph (6), the Royal Court may determine that
the certificate does not so apply.

(9)

(10)

A document purporting to be a certificate under subparagraph (2) must be –
(a)

received in evidence, and

(b)

deemed to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.

A document which purports to be certified by or on behalf of Her Majesty's
Procureur as a true copy of a certificate issued by Her Majesty's Procureur
under subparagraph (2) must be regarded in any legal proceedings as
evidence of the certificate.

(11)

For the avoidance of doubt, no power conferred by a provision of Part XI or
XII of this Law may be exercised in relation to personal data which by virtue
of this paragraph is exempt from the provision concerned.

19.

Committee may make further exceptions and exemptions.
The Committee may by regulations –
(a)

provide for modifications to, and further exceptions to or exemptions
from, any designated provision, and

(b)

amend this Schedule for the purpose specified in paragraph (a).
Part IV
Interpretation of this Schedule

20.

Interpretation.
In this Schedule –
"a provision of Part III" means –
(a)

253

(b)

far as the provision corresponds to a right or duty in Part III of
this Law,

"designated provision" means –
(a)

performance in any test, work or other activity, for any academic, professional or
other purpose.

254

SCHEDULE 9
EXPRESSIONS WITH SPECIAL MEANINGS
Sections 110 and 111(1)

1.

Identifiable individual.
An individual is identifiable from any information where the individual can
be directly or indirectly identified from the information, including –
(a)

by reference to a name or an identifier,

(b)

by reference to one or more factors specific to the person’s physical,
physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity,

(c)

where, despite pseudonymisation, that information is capable of being
attributed to that individual by the use of additional information, or

(d)

by any other means reasonably likely to be used, taking into account
objective factors such as technological factors and the cost and amount
of time required for identification in the light of the available
technology at the time of processing.

2.

Processing in the context of a controller or processor.
Personal data is processed in the context of a controller or processor if the
personal data is processed –
(a)

by or on behalf of the controller or processor, or

(b)

otherwise in the course of or in connection with any activity of the
controller or processor.

3.

Necessary for a particular purpose or aim.
Whether or not the processing of personal data is necessary for any particular
purpose or aim must be determined having regard to –

255

(a)

whether or not processing of that personal data in the particular
circumstances would be proportionate to the purpose or aim, having
regard to the proportionality factors, and

(b)

whether or not it is practicable in all the circumstances to achieve that
purpose or aim without so processing the personal data.

4.

Proportionality factors.

(1)

The proportionality factors are –
(a)

the nature of the personal data, including whether it is special

(b)

the data subject, including whether the data subject is a child,

(c)

the context in which the personal data has been collected or otherwise

category data,

processed, and in particular the relationship between the data subject
and the controller,
(d)

the reasonable expectations of the data subject in relation to the
processing of that personal data,

(e)

the possible consequences of the processing for data subjects,

(f)

the interests at stake, and in particular any significant interests of the
data subject or any other individual who is a third party,

(g)

the existence of appropriate safeguards for the protection of the
personal data or the protection of significant interests of data subjects,

(h)

where disclosure of the personal data is or may be involved, the
entities to which, and the purposes for which, the personal data is or
may be disclosed,

(i)

where disclosure of the personal data without consent of the data
subject is or may be involved, whether the controller owes the data
subject a duty of confidentiality, and

(j)

where storage of the personal data is or may be involved, the period
for which the personal data is or may be stored.

256

(2)

A person weighing the proportionality factors in any case involving special
category data must have particular regard to the importance of protecting
special category data from processing where the data subject has not given
explicit consent to the processing of the special category data.

5.

Processing for historical or scientific purpose.

(1)

Subject to subparagraphs (2) and (3), personal data is processed for a
historical or scientific purpose, if it is processed for –
(a)

(2)

the purpose of archiving in the public interest,

(b)

a scientific or historical research purpose, or

(c)

a statistical purpose.

Personal data may be regarded as processed for a historical or scientific
purpose even if the data is disclosed –
(a)

to any person for research purposes only,

(b)

to the data subject or a person acting on the data subject's behalf,

(c)

at the request, or with the consent, of the data subject or a person
acting on the data subject's behalf, or

(d)

in circumstances in which the person making the disclosure has
reasonable grounds for believing that the disclosure falls within item
(a), (b) or (c) of this subparagraph.

(3)

Personal data must not be regarded as processed for a historical or scientific
purpose where the data is processed –
(a)

in order to make a decision, or facilitate or allow a decision to be
made, with respect to a particular data subject, or

(b)

in such a way that substantial damage is, or is likely to be, caused to
any data subject.

257

6.

High risk to significant interests of data subjects.

(1)

Subject to subparagraph (2), whether any processing of personal data is likely
to pose a high risk to the significant interests of data subjects must be
determined having regard to the nature, scope, context and purpose of the
processing, having particular regard to whether a new technology,
mechanism or procedure is used to process the personal data.

(2)

Processing of personal data is deemed to be likely to pose a high risk to the
significant interests of data subjects where it involves –
(a)

a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to
data subjects based on automated processing, and decisions are based
on the evaluation that affect the significant interests of data subjects,

(b)

large-scale processing of special category data,

(c)

large-scale and systematic monitoring of a public place, or

(d)

any other prescribed kind or description of processing.

7.

Breach of an operative provision or duty.

(1)

with or contravene the operative provision, or

(b)

the controller or processor is likely to fail to comply with or
contravene the operative provision in connection with any processing
or related act or omission.

258

(3)

any controller or processor, means –
(a)

any proposed processing in the context of the controller or processor,
or

(b)

any intended act or intended omission of the controller or processor,
