PART 4
PROCESS FOR IMPOSING SIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER OBLIGATIONS EX ANTE
Determination of significant market power in relevant markets
20
(1) The Authority may make administrative determinations that impose ex ante
remedies on a communications provider in respect of its provision of electronic
communications or the provision of subscription audiovisual programming content in a
relevant market or markets if, individually or together with others, the communications
provider has significant market power in that market.
(2) In order to determine whether a communications provider has significant
market power, the Authority shall conduct a review of a relevant market or markets in
accordance with section 23 of this Act and section 59(2) of the Regulatory Authority Act
2011.

25

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ACT 2011
Principles and objectives of the market review process
In determining whether to impose, modify or withdraw significant market power
21
obligations with respect to a particular provider or providers based on its review of the
relevant market, and in deciding which types of obligations to apply, the Authority shall
seek to—
(a) develop or maintain effective and sustainable competition for the benefit of
consumers with regard to price, innovation and choice;
(b) promote investment in the electronic communications sector;
(c) establish ex ante remedies that are effective but proportionate, taking into
account the costs of compliance and the ultimate benefits to consumers;
(d) establish ex ante remedies that apply on a technology-neutral and serviceneutral basis whenever feasible; and
(e) rely on market forces and withdraw, reduce or limit ex ante remedies in
circumstances where the Authority concludes that markets are effectively
competitive or likely to become so within a reasonable period of time, taking
into account actual and expected market circumstances.
Preliminary identification of markets susceptible to ex ante regulation
22
(1) The Authority shall issue a notice that identifies any relevant product and
geographic market which in its view appears to be susceptible to the imposition of ex ante
remedies, based on a forward-looking assessment.
(2) The markets identified pursuant to subsection (1) may include retail markets
and wholesale markets and shall be identified on the basis of the Authority’s preliminary
assessment that the markets meet all of the following criteria and any other criteria that
the Authority deems to be pertinent—
(a) the relevant market is characterised by high and non-transitory barriers
to entry;
(b) taking into account actual and expected market circumstances during the
period under review, the relevant market either—
(i) is not likely to be affected by technological changes or other
developments that would render it effectively competitive, or
(ii) is likely to cease to be effectively competitive; and
(c) the application of ex post competition rules alone would not be sufficient
to promote or preserve effective competition in the relevant market.
(3) The Authority may, in its discretion, confer formally or informally with sectoral
participants and others, and may consider relevant international benchmarks in order to
make a preliminary assessment of significant market power under subsection (1).
(4) The Authority shall provide a summary explanation of its preliminary views as
part of the notice referred to in subsection (1).

26

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ACT 2011
Market review procedures
23
(1) The Authority may publish advisory guidelines that identify or clarify the
criteria for—
(a) defining relevant product markets based upon demand and supply-side
characteristics;
(b) defining relevant geographic markets;
(c) assessing market power in such markets based on a forward-looking
assessment;
(d) establishing effective ex ante remedies and obligations; and
(e) any other aspect of the market review process.
(2) The Authority shall, in conducting a market assessment pursuant to
subsections (1)(a), (b) or (c), consider all of the factors that it deems relevant under the
circumstances, which may include the following—
(a) the overall size of the communications provider and its share of the relevant
market;
(b) the volatility of shares in the relevant market;
(c) the communications provider’s control over infrastructure not easily
duplicated;
(d) the communications provider’s technological advantages or superiority;
(e) the degree of countervailing buyer power;
(f) the communications provider’s ability to access capital and financial
markets relative to that of its competitors;
(g) the existence of economies of scale or scope;
(h) the diversification of products or services (including bundles);
(i) the relative advantages of vertical integration enjoyed by the sectoral
provider;
(j) the presence of de jure or de facto barriers to market entry or expansion;
and
(k) evidence of previous anti-competitive behaviour.
(3) In assessing whether two or more communications providers operating in the
same relevant market jointly have significant market power, the Authority shall consider,
among other relevant factors, whether—
(a) the relevant market is concentrated;
(b) each provider has a relatively high and stable share of the relevant market;
(c) significant and enduring barriers to entry exist; and

27

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ACT 2011
(d) there are reasonable grounds for concluding that these factors, in
combination with any relevant factors set out in subsection (2), are
evidence of a market structure that is likely to give rise to tacit coordination
and thereby prevent, restrict or distort competition in the provision of
products or services in the relevant market.
(4) The Authority shall conduct a public consultation to review those markets
identified in accordance with section 22 that in its view are susceptible to ex ante regulation,
if any, or pursuant to subsection (6), for the purposes of—
(a) evaluating whether these relevant markets are, or continue to be, correctly
defined based on an economic assessment of supply and demand;
(b) analysing whether a communications provider, individually or with others,
in fact possesses, or continues to hold, significant market power in one or
more of these relevant markets based on the applicable facts and
circumstances; and
(c) deciding which obligations, if any, should be imposed in respect of each
relevant market characterised by significant market power in order to
promote or preserve effective competition, in accordance with section 24.
(5) The Authority shall issue one or more general determinations designating the
communications provider, if any, which, individually or with others, has significant market
power in each relevant market reviewed pursuant to subsection (4) and specifying any ex
ante obligations that shall apply in accordance with section 24.
(6) A further review of any relevant product or geographic market identified as
requiring ex ante regulation pursuant to subsection (5) may be carried out by the Authority
on its own initiative or, at its discretion, upon the request of an interested party, provided
that―
(a) the Authority shall conclude a further review of each relevant market
within a period of not more than four years from the date of its completion
of the previous review of the same relevant market in any case in which it
has made a finding of significant market power; and
(b) in determining when to initiate an initial or further review of a relevant
product or geographic market, the Authority shall take into account
requests from sectoral participants, the views of consumers and relevant
market developments.
(7) A general determination made by the Authority finding that a communications
provider possesses significant market power in a relevant market shall be considered
interim, and shall not constitute final Authority action for purposes of the Regulatory
Authority Act 2011, until the Authority makes a determination specifying the ex ante
obligations, if any, that shall apply in respect of such relevant market in accordance with
section 24.

28

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ACT 2011
Imposition of ex ante remedies
24
(1) If, as part of the market review process, the Authority concludes that the
imposition of one or more ex ante remedies is necessary to prevent or deter anti-competitive
effects that are, or are likely to be, caused by the presence of significant market power in a
relevant market, the Authority may make an administrative determination imposing one or
more of the following obligations on any communications provider found to have significant
market power in a relevant market—
(a) the obligation to interconnect its electronic communications network with
the network of another communications provider for the purpose of
originating, transiting or terminating traffic, and to provide such
interconnection pursuant to terms and conditions specified by the
Authority;
(b) the obligation to provide wholesale services to other communications
providers for resale and, where the Authority deems it necessary, to offer
specified minimum features, functionality or other attributes;
(c) the obligation to meet reasonable requests for access to, and the use of,
specified network elements and associated facilities and services and to
provide such access pursuant to specifications, terms and conditions that
may be established or approved by the Authority including, as the
circumstances may warrant, the obligation to provide—
(i) co-location with third parties or other forms of facility sharing,
including the sharing of ducts, conduit, buildings, cabinets or masts;
(ii) unbundled access to specified network elements and associated
databases;
(iii) information about technical interfaces, protocols or key technologies
that are required for the interoperability of services and timely
information with regard to any planned changes to the same;
(iv) software
systems
necessary
for
provisioning
electronic
communications, including operational support systems; and
(v) up-to-date information systems or databases containing information
relating to the location or availability of particular mandated access
components or for ordering, provisioning, maintenance and repair
requests and billing;
(d) the obligation to meet reasonable requests for access pursuant to terms
and conditions that may be established by the Authority including, as the
circumstances may warrant—
(i) access to physical infrastructure including buildings, ducts and masts;
(ii) access to number
functionality;

conditions that are transparent, including the publication of reference
interconnection and access offers, pursuant to a framework approved by
the Authority;
(f) the obligations of transparency and non-discrimination in the provision of
retail services to end-users and wholesale services to other
communications providers, including the requirements to―
(i) apply equivalent terms and conditions in equivalent circumstances to
end-users or to other communications providers; and
(ii) in the case of wholesale services, to provide facilities, services and
information to others under the same conditions and of the same
quality as it provides for its own internal purposes or to those of its
divisions, subsidiaries, partners and affiliates;
(g) the obligation to comply with requirements relating to the pricing of
wholesale and retail electronic communications and the provision or
distribution of subscription audiovisual programming, including
obligations relating to the cost orientation of prices and transparency;
(h) the obligation to provide certain types of wholesale access or
interconnection prior to the introduction of associated downstream
services that rely on such inputs by the communications provider or its
subsidiaries, partners and affiliates;
(i) the obligation to establish and maintain a cost accounting system in
accordance with cost allocation and separation rules that are stipulated or
approved by the Authority for the purpose of ensuring that a vertically
integrated communications provider’s costs and revenues are properly
attributed or assigned to specific activities and facilitate the detection of
anti-competitive cross-subsidies by an independent auditor;
(j) the obligation to publish audit information in a format that contributes to
an open and competitive market while preserving the confidentiality of
accounting data deemed commercially sensitive by the Authority;
(k) the obligation not to unreasonably bundle other services with a service that
is subject to ex ante regulation, whether provided by the communications
provider, its subsidiaries, partners or affiliates, including a prohibition
against―

30

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ACT 2011
(ii) offering bundles at retail prices that are predatory or cannot be
replicated by an efficient competitor, as defined by the Authority;
(l) the obligation to provide carrier selection and related terms and conditions
in the manner specified by the Authority;
(m) in exceptional cases where the Authority determines that other measures
have not prevented or deterred anti-competitive effects, the obligation to

functionally separate and independently operated business entity, and to
provide such services and facilities to competing communications
providers and its own retail business operators on the same terms and
conditions including those relating to pricing, availability and service
quality, and by means of the same systems and processes;
(n) the obligation to provide subscription audiovisual programming content or
distribution on a wholesale basis on reasonable terms and conditions; or
(o) such other obligations as the Authority may, following a public
consultation, deem necessary to promote or preserve effective competition
in a relevant market or markets.
(2) The Authority shall specify, in a general determination, the categories of
communications providers that are eligible to obtain interconnection, access or associated
facilities and services in accordance with subsection (1), which shall at a minimum include
all ICOL holders.
(3) A full and complete copy of any access or interconnection agreement entered
into by a communications provider with significant market power in accordance with
subsection (1) shall be filed by that communications provider with the Authority within
three business days of its execution, and―
(a) the Authority may, within 60 days of the filing, object to any provision that
it preliminarily concludes is unreasonably discriminatory or contrary to
the interests of consumers and conduct an adjudication; and
(b) any disputes that arise in connection with the negotiation or fulfilment of
any such agreement shall be ineligible for referral to binding arbitration
pursuant to section 93(4)(b) of the Regulatory Authority Act 2011.
(4) Any obligations imposed in accordance with this section shall be proportionate
and justified in light of the relevant circumstances and the purposes and objectives set out
in sections 5 and 21 and shall, in the case of any access obligations, take account of—

section in respect of relevant markets that the Authority has determined
are characterised by significant market power.
Withdrawal of ex ante remedies
25
Where, as a result of a market review conducted pursuant to section 23, the
Authority determines that a relevant market is effectively competitive it shall not impose
any ex ante remedies in respect of that market and shall remove any ex ante remedies
previously imposed within a reasonable period of time, but the Authority may decide not to
remove certain obligations, including transparency and accounting separation obligations,
if they continue to be necessary to preserve effective competition in cases where a closely
related relevant market is subject to ex ante regulation.
