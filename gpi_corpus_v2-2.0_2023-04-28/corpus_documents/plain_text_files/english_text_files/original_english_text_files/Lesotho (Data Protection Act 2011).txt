The object of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a data plotection

other hand fi'ee flow of information is a necessary feature of economic life. The
Bill ploposes provisions intended to balance protection of pelsonal data rights
against economic intelests of the wider society.
The Bill makes provision for information protection plinciples that reflect international best practice on the rules that should apply to the processing ofpersonal information. It also provides for exceptions to, exemptions and exclusions
fi'om compliance with the information protection principies, in so far as this is
necessal'y to reconcile the right to personal information plivacy with the light to
leceive and impalt infolmation. It further makes provision for regulation of automatic and manual processing of pelsona; and sensitive personal data by public and private bodies.
The

Bill stipulates clearly

defined rights of data subject and conesponding ob-

ligations of data contloliers. Importantly, the Bill establishes the data protection
commission, whose main function wil1be to oversee and ensure compliance
with the Data Protection legislation. Additionally, the Biil makes provision for'
a legal infrastructule compatible with intemational best practices and rules especially compliance with the European Union's Data Protection Directive95l46
EC since that wil1be a prelequisite for commelcial; dataflows between the European Union and the Kingdom of Lesotho. The compliance will further support trans-border flows of pelsonal data ploposes of tlade, economic and social
development.
