DIRECTIVES
DIRECTIVE (EU) 2018/1972 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 11 December 2018
establishing the European Electronic Communications Code
(Recast)
(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1)

Directives 2002/19/EC (4), 2002/20/EC (5), 2002/21/EC (6) and 2002/22/EC (7) of the European Parliament and of
the Council have been substantially amended. Since further amendments are to be made, those Directives should be
recast in the interests of clarity.

(2)

The functioning of the five Directives which are part of the existing regulatory framework for electronic
communications networks and services, namely Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC,
and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), is subject to periodic review by the
Commission, with a view, in particular, to determining the need for modification in light of technological and
market developments.

(3)

In its communication or 6 May 2015 setting out a Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe, the Commission stated
that its review of the telecommunications framework would focus on measures that aim to provide incentives for
investment in high-speed broadband networks, bring a more consistent internal market approach to radio spectrum
policy and management, deliver conditions for a true internal market by tackling regulatory fragmentation, ensure
effective protection of consumers, a level playing field for all market players and consistent application of the rules,
as well as provide a more effective regulatory institutional framework.

This Directive is part of a ‘Regulatory Fitness’ (REFIT) exercise, the scope of which includes four Directives,
namely 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC, and Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (1). Each of those Directives contains measures applicable to providers of
electronic communications networks and of electronic communications services, consistently with the regulatory
history of the sector under which undertakings were vertically integrated, namely, active in both the provision of
networks and of services. The review offers an occasion to recast the four Directives in order to simplify the current
structure with a view to reinforcing its consistency and accessibility in relation to the REFIT objective. It also offers
the possibility to adapt the structure to the new market reality, where the provision of communications services is no
longer necessarily bundled to the provision of a network. As provided in the Interinstitutional Agreement
of 28 November 2001 on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts (2), recasting consists in the
adoption of a new legal act which incorporates in a single text both the substantive amendments which it makes to
an earlier act and the unchanged provisions of that act. The proposal for recasting deals with the substantive
amendments which it makes to an earlier act, and on a secondary level, includes the codification of the unchanged
provisions of the earlier act with those substantive amendments.

(5)

This Directive creates a legal framework to ensure freedom to provide electronic communications networks and
services, subject only to the conditions laid down in this Directive and to any restrictions in accordance with
Article 52(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular measures regarding
public policy, public security and public health, and consistent with Article 52(1) of the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’).

(6)

This Directive is without prejudice to the possibility for each Member State to take the necessary measures to ensure
the protection of its essential security interests, to safeguard public policy and public security, and to permit the
investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, taking into account that any limitation to the exercise
of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter, in particular in Articles 7, 8 and 11 thereof, such as limitations
regarding the processing of data, are to be provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights and freedoms and
be subject to the principle of proportionality, in accordance with Article 52(1) of the Charter.

(7)

The convergence of the telecommunications, media and information technology sectors means that all electronic
communications networks and services should be covered to the extent possible by a single European electronic
communications code established by means of a single Directive, with the exception of matters better dealt with
through directly applicable rules established by means of regulations. It is necessary to separate the regulation of
electronic communications networks and services from the regulation of content. Therefore, this Directive does not
cover the content of services delivered over electronic communications networks using electronic communications
services, such as broadcasting content, financial services and certain information society services, and is without
prejudice to measures taken at Union or national level in respect of such services, in accordance with Union law, in
order to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and to ensure the defence of media pluralism. The content of
television programmes is covered by Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). The
regulation of audiovisual policy and content aims at achieving general interest objectives, such as freedom of
expression, media pluralism, impartiality, cultural and linguistic diversity, social inclusion, consumer protection and
the protection of minors. The separation between the regulation of electronic communications and the regulation of
content does not affect the taking into account of the links existing between them, in particular in order to guarantee
media pluralism, cultural diversity and consumer protection. Within the limits of their competences, competent
authorities should contribute to ensuring the implementation of policies aiming to promote those objectives.

(8)

This Directive does not affect the application to radio equipment of Directive 2014/53/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council (4), but does cover car radio and consumer radio receivers, and consumer
digital television equipment.

Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 establishing the Body of
European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office (OJ L 337, 18.12.2009, p. 1).

In order to allow national regulatory and other competent authorities to meet the objectives set out in this Directive,
in particular concerning end-to-end interoperability, the scope of the Directive should cover certain aspects of radio
equipment as defined in Directive 2014/53/EU and consumer equipment used for digital television, in order to
facilitate access for end-users with disabilities. It is important for national regulatory and other competent authorities
to encourage network operators and equipment manufacturers to cooperate in order to facilitate access by end-users
with disabilities to electronic communications services. The non-exclusive use of radio spectrum for the self-use of
radio terminal equipment, although not related to an economic activity, should also be the subject of this Directive
in order to ensure a coordinated approach with regard to their authorisation regime.

(10)

Certain electronic communications services under this Directive could also fall within the scope of the definition of
‘information society service’ set out in Article 1 of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (1). The provisions of that Directive that govern information society services apply to those electronic
communications services to the extent that this Directive or other Union legal acts do not contain more specific
provisions applicable to electronic communications services. However, electronic communications services such as
voice telephony, messaging services and electronic mail services are covered by this Directive. The same undertaking,
for example an internet service provider, can offer both an electronic communications service, such as access to the
internet, and services not covered by this Directive, such as the provision of web-based and not communicationsrelated content.

(11)

The same undertaking, for example a cable operator, can offer both an electronic communications service, such as
the conveyance of television signals, and services not covered under this Directive, such as the commercialisation of
an offer of sound or television broadcasting content services, and therefore additional obligations can be imposed on
such an undertaking in relation to its activity as a content provider or distributor, in accordance with provisions
other than those of this Directive, without prejudice to the conditions laid in an annex to this Directive.

(12)

The regulatory framework should cover the use of radio spectrum by all electronic communications networks,
including the emerging self-use of radio spectrum by new types of networks consisting exclusively of autonomous
systems of mobile radio equipment that is connected via wireless links without a central management or centralised
network operator, and not necessarily within the exercise of any specific economic activity. In the developing 5G
wireless communications environment, such networks are likely to develop in particular outside buildings and on
the roads, for transport, energy, research and development, eHealth, public protection and disaster relief, the Internet
of Things, machine-to-machine and connected cars. As a result, the application by Member States, based on Article 7
of Directive 2014/53/EU, of additional national requirements regarding the putting into service or use of such radio
equipment, or both, in relation to the effective and efficient use of radio spectrum and avoidance of harmful
interference should reflect the principles of the internal market.

(13)

The requirements concerning the capabilities of electronic communications networks are constantly increasing.
While in the past the focus was mainly on growing bandwidth available overall and to each individual user, other
parameters such as latency, availability and reliability are becoming increasingly important. The current response
towards that demand is to bring optical fibre closer and closer to the user, and future ‘very high capacity networks’
require performance parameters which are equivalent to those that a network based on optical fibre elements at least
up to the distribution point at the serving location can deliver. In the case of fixed-line connection, this corresponds
to network performance equivalent to that achievable by an optical fibre installation up to a multi-dwelling building,
considered to be the serving location. In the case of wireless connection, this corresponds to network performance
similar to that achievable based on an optical fibre installation up to the base station, considered to be the serving
location. Variations in end-users’ experience which are due to the different characteristics of the medium by which
the network ultimately connects with the network termination point should not be taken into account for the
purposes of establishing whether a wireless network could be considered as providing similar network performance.

Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the
provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ L 241, 17.9.2015,
p. 1).

In accordance with the principle of technology neutrality, other technologies and transmission media should not be
excluded, where they compare with that baseline scenario in terms of their capabilities. The roll-out of such ‘very
high capacity networks’ is likely to further increase the capabilities of networks and pave the way for the roll-out of
future wireless network generations based on enhanced air interfaces and a more densified network architecture.

(14)

Definitions need to be adjusted to ensure that they are in line with the principle of technology neutrality and to keep
pace with technological development, including new forms of network management such as through software
emulation or software-defined networks. Technological and market evolution has brought networks to move to
internet protocol (IP) technology, and enabled end-users to choose between a range of competing voice service
providers. Therefore, the term ‘publicly available telephone service’, which is exclusively used in Directive 2002/22/
EC and widely perceived as referring to traditional analogue telephone services, should be replaced by the more
current and technological neutral term ‘voice communications service’. Conditions for the provision of a service
should be separated from the actual definitional elements of a voice communications service, namely, a publicly
available electronic communications service for originating and receiving, directly or indirectly, national or national
and international calls through a number or numbers in a national or international numbering plan, whether such a
service is based on circuit switching or packet switching technology. It is the nature of such a service that it is
bidirectional, enabling both parties to communicate. A service which does not fulfil all those conditions, such as for
example a ‘click-through’ application on a customer service website, is not such a service. Voice communications
services also include means of communication specifically intended for end-users with disabilities using text relay or
total conversation services.

(15)

The services used for communications purposes, and the technical means of their delivery, have evolved
considerably. End-users increasingly substitute traditional voice telephony, text messages (SMS) and electronic mail
conveyance services by functionally equivalent online services such as Voice over IP, messaging services and webbased e-mail services. In order to ensure that end-users and their rights are effectively and equally protected when
using functionally equivalent services, a future-oriented definition of electronic communications services should not
be purely based on technical parameters but rather build on a functional approach. The scope of necessary
regulation should be appropriate to achieve its public interest objectives. While ‘conveyance of signals’ remains an
important parameter for determining the services falling into the scope of this Directive, the definition should cover
also other services that enable communication. From an end-user’s perspective it is not relevant whether a provider
conveys signals itself or whether the communication is delivered via an internet access service. The definition of
electronic communications services should therefore contain three types of services which may partly overlap, that is
to say internet access services as defined in point (2) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (1), interpersonal communications services as defined in this Directive, and
services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The definition of electronic communications
service should eliminate ambiguities observed in the implementation of the definition as it existed prior to the
adoption of this Directive and allow a calibrated provision-by-provision application of the specific rights and
obligations contained in the framework to the different types of services. The processing of personal data by
electronic communications services, whether as remuneration or otherwise, should comply with Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2).

(16)

In order to fall within the scope of the definition of electronic communications service, a service needs to be
provided normally in exchange for remuneration. In the digital economy, market participants increasingly consider
information about users as having a monetary value. Electronic communications services are often supplied to the

Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 laying down measures
concerning open internet access and amending Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic
communications networks and services and Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks
within the Union (OJ L 310, 26.11.2015, p. 1).
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons
with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General
Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).

L 321/40

end-user not only for money, but increasingly and in particular for the provision of personal data or other data. The
concept of remuneration should therefore encompass situations where the provider of a service requests and the
end-user knowingly provides personal data within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or other data directly
or indirectly to the provider. It should also encompass situations where the end-user allows access to information
without actively supplying it, such as personal data, including the IP address, or other automatically generated
information, such as information collected and transmitted by a cookie. In line with the case-law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice) on Article 57 TFEU (1), remuneration also exists within the meaning
of the TFEU if the service provider is paid by a third party and not by the service recipient. The concept of
remuneration should therefore also encompass situations in which the end-user is exposed to advertisements as a
condition for gaining access to the service, or situations in which the service provider monetises personal data it has
collected in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

(17)

Interpersonal communications services are services that enable interpersonal and interactive exchange of
information, covering services like traditional voice calls between two individuals but also all types of emails,
messaging services, or group chats. Interpersonal communications services only cover communications between a
finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of natural persons, which is determined by the sender of the
communication. Communications involving legal persons should fall within the scope of the definition where
natural persons act on behalf of those legal persons or are involved at least on one side of the communication.
Interactive communication entails that the service allows the recipient of the information to respond. Services which
do not meet those requirements, such as linear broadcasting, video on demand, websites, social networks, blogs, or
exchange of information between machines, should not be considered to be interpersonal communications services.
In exceptional circumstances a service should not be considered to be an interpersonal communications service if
the interpersonal and interactive communication facility is a minor and purely ancillary feature to another service
and for objective technical reasons cannot be used without that principal service, and its integration is not a means
to circumvent the applicability of the rules governing electronic communications services. As elements of an
exemption from the definition the terms ‘minor’ and ‘purely ancillary’ should be interpreted narrowly and from an
objective end-user’s perspective. An interpersonal communications feature could be considered to be minor where
its objective utility for an end-user is very limited and where it is in reality barely used by end-users. An example of a
feature that could be considered to fall outside the scope of the definition of interpersonal communications services
might be, in principle, a communication channel in online games, depending on the features of the communication
facility of the service.

(18)

Interpersonal communications services using numbers from national and international numbering plans connect
with publicly assigned numbering resources. Those number-based interpersonal communications services comprise
both services to which end-users numbers are assigned for the purpose of ensuring end-to-end connectivity and
services enabling end-users to reach persons to whom such numbers have been assigned. The mere use of a number
as an identifier should not be considered to be equivalent to the use of a number to connect with publicly assigned
numbers and should therefore, in itself, not be considered to be sufficient to qualify a service as a number-based
interpersonal communications service. Number-independent interpersonal communications services should be
subject to obligations only where public interests require that specific regulatory obligations apply to all types of
interpersonal communications services, regardless of whether they use numbers for the provision of their service. It
is justified to treat number-based interpersonal communications services differently, as they participate in, and hence
also benefit from, a publicly assured interoperable ecosystem.

(19)

The network termination point represents a boundary for regulatory purposes between the regulatory framework
for electronic communications networks and services and the regulation of telecommunications terminal
equipment. Defining the location of the network termination point is the responsibility of the national regulatory

authority. In light of the practice of national regulatory authorities, and given the variety of fixed and wireless
topologies, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (‘BEREC’) should, in close cooperation
with the Commission, adopt guidelines on common approaches to the identification of the network termination
point, in accordance with this Directive, in various concrete circumstances.

(20)

Technical developments make it possible for end-users to access emergency services not only by voice calls but also
by other interpersonal communications services. The concept of emergency communication should therefore cover
all interpersonal communications services that allow such emergency services access. It builds on the emergency
system elements already enshrined in Union law, namely a public safety answering point (‘PSAP’) and a most
appropriate PSAP as defined in Regulation (EU) 2015/758 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), and on
emergency services as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 (2).

(21)

National regulatory and other competent authorities should have a harmonised set of objectives and principles to
underpin their work, and should, where necessary, coordinate their actions with the authorities of other
Member States and with BEREC in carrying out their tasks under this regulatory framework.

(22)

The tasks assigned to competent authorities by this Directive contribute to the fulfilment of broader policies in the
areas of culture, employment, the environment, social cohesion and town and country planning.

(23)

The regulatory framework should, in addition to the existing three primary objectives of promoting competition, the
internal market and end-user interests, pursue an additional connectivity objective, articulated in terms of outcomes:
widespread access to and take-up of very high capacity networks for all citizens of the Union and Union businesses
on the basis of reasonable price and choice, effective and fair competition, open innovation, efficient use of radio
spectrum, common rules and predictable regulatory approaches in the internal market and the necessary sectorspecific rules to safeguard the interests of citizens of the Union. For the Member States, the national regulatory and
other competent authorities and the stakeholders, that connectivity objective translates, on the one hand, into
aiming for the highest capacity networks and services economically sustainable in a given area, and, on the other,
into pursuing territorial cohesion, in the sense of convergence in capacity available in different areas.

(24)

Progress towards the achievement of the general objectives of this Directive should be supported by a robust system
of continuous assessment and benchmarking by the Commission of Member States with respect to the availability of
very high capacity networks in all major socio-economic drivers such as schools, transport hubs and major
providers of public services, and highly digitised businesses, the availability of uninterrupted 5G coverage for urban
areas and major terrestrial transport paths, and the availability to all households in each Member State of electronic
communications networks which are capable of providing at least 100 Mbps, and which are promptly upgradeable
to gigabit speeds. To that end, the Commission should continue monitoring the performance of Member States,
including, by way of an example, indexes that summarise relevant indicators on the Union’s digital performance and
track the evolution of Member States in digital competitiveness, such as the Digital Economy and Society Index, and,
where necessary, establish new methods and new objective, concrete and quantifiable criteria for benchmarking the
effectiveness of Member States.

(25)

The principle that Member States should apply Union law in a technologically neutral fashion, that is to say that a
national regulatory or other competent authority should neither impose nor discriminate in favour of the use of a
particular type of technology, does not preclude the taking of proportionate steps to promote certain specific
services where justified in order to attain the objectives of the regulatory framework, for example digital television as

19.5.2015, p 77).
Commission Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 of 26 November 2012 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council with regard to the harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall (OJ L 91, 3.4.2013, p. 1).

L 321/42

a means for increasing radio spectrum efficiency. Furthermore, that principle does not preclude taking into account
that certain transmission media have physical characteristics and architectural features that can be superior in terms
of quality of service, capacity, maintenance cost, energy efficiency, management flexibility, reliability, robustness and
scalability, and, ultimately, performance, which can be reflected in actions taken with a view to pursuing the various
regulatory objectives.

(26)

Both efficient investment and competition should be encouraged in tandem, in order to increase economic growth,
innovation and consumer choice.

(27)

Competition can best be fostered through an economically efficient level of investment in new and existing
infrastructure, complemented by regulation, where necessary, to achieve effective competition in retail services. An
efficient level of infrastructure-based competition is the extent of infrastructure duplication at which investors can
reasonably be expected to make a fair return based on reasonable expectations about the evolution of market shares.

(28)

It is necessary to give appropriate incentives for investment in new very high capacity networks that support
innovation in content-rich internet services and strengthen the international competitiveness of the Union. Such
networks have enormous potential to deliver benefits to consumers and businesses across the Union. It is therefore
vital to promote sustainable investment in the development of those new networks, while safeguarding competition,
as bottlenecks and barriers to entry remain at the infrastructure level, and boosting consumer choice through
regulatory predictability and consistency.

(29)

This Directive aims to progressively reduce ex ante sector-specific rules as competition in the markets develops and,
ultimately, to ensure that electronic communications are governed only by competition law. Considering that the
markets for electronic communications have shown strong competitive dynamics in recent years, it is essential that
ex ante regulatory obligations are imposed only where there is no effective and sustainable competition on the
markets concerned. The objective of ex ante regulatory intervention is to produce benefits for end-users by making
retail markets effectively competitive on a sustainable basis. Obligations at wholesale level should be imposed where
otherwise one or more retail markets are not likely to become effectively competitive in the absence of those
obligations. It is likely that national regulatory authorities are gradually, through the process of market analysis, able
to find retail markets to be competitive even in the absence of wholesale regulation, especially taking into account
expected improvements in innovation and competition. In such a case, the national regulatory authority should
conclude that regulation is no longer needed at wholesale level, and assess the corresponding relevant wholesale
market with a view to withdrawing ex ante regulation. In doing so, the national regulatory authority should take into
account any leverage effects between wholesale and related retail markets which might require the removal of
barriers to entry at the infrastructure level in order to ensure long-term competition at the retail level.

(30)

Electronic communications are becoming essential for an increasing number of sectors. The Internet of Things is an
illustration of how the radio signal conveyance underpinning electronic communications continues to evolve and
shape societal and business reality. To derive the greatest benefit from those developments, the introduction and
accommodation of new wireless communications technologies and applications in radio spectrum management is
essential. As other technologies and applications relying on radio spectrum are equally subject to growing demand,
and can be enhanced by integrating or combining them with electronic communications, radio spectrum
management should adopt, where appropriate, a cross-sectorial approach to improve the efficient use of radio
spectrum.

(31)

Strategic planning, coordination and, where appropriate, harmonisation at Union level can help ensure that radio
spectrum users derive the full benefits of the internal market and that Union interests can be effectively defended
globally. For those purposes it should be possible to adopt multiannual radio spectrum policy programmes, where
appropriate. The first such programme was established by Decision No 243/2012/EU of the European Parliament

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/43

and of the Council (1), setting out policy orientations and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of
the use of radio spectrum in the Union. It should be possible for those policy orientations and objectives to refer to
the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal
market, in accordance with this Directive.

(32)

National borders are increasingly irrelevant in determining optimal radio spectrum use. Undue fragmentation
amongst national policies result in increased costs and lost market opportunities for radio spectrum users and slows
down innovation to the detriment of the proper functioning of the internal market and prejudice to consumers and
the economy as a whole.

(33)

The radio spectrum management provisions of this Directive should be consistent with the work of international
and regional organisations dealing with radio spectrum management, such as the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), in order to
ensure the effective management of and harmonisation of the use of radio spectrum across the Union and between
the Member States and other members of the ITU.

(34)

In accordance with the principle of the separation of regulatory and operational functions, Member States should
guarantee the independence of the national regulatory and other competent authorities with a view to ensuring the
impartiality of their decisions. This requirement of independence is without prejudice to the institutional autonomy
and constitutional obligations of the Member States or to the principle of neutrality with regard to the rules in
Member States governing the system of property ownership laid down in Article 345 TFEU. National regulatory and
other competent authorities should be in possession of all the necessary resources, in terms of staffing, expertise, and
financial means, for the performance of their tasks.

(35)

Certain tasks pursuant to the Directive, such as ex ante market regulation, including the imposition of obligations for
access and interconnection, and the resolution of disputes between undertakings are tasks which should be
undertaken only by national regulatory authorities, namely, bodies which are independent both from the sector and
from any external intervention or political pressure. Unless otherwise provided, Member States should be able to
assign other regulatory tasks provided for in this Directive either to the national regulatory authorities or to other
competent authorities. In the course of transposition, Member States should promote the stability of competences of
the national regulatory authorities with regard to the assignment of tasks which resulted from the transposition of
the Union electronic communications regulatory framework as amended in 2009, in particular those related to
market competition or market entry. Where tasks are assigned to other competent authorities, those other
competent authorities should seek to consult the national regulatory authorities before taking a decision. Pursuant to
the principle of good cooperation, national regulatory and other competent authorities should exchange
information for the exercise of their tasks.

(36)

This Directive does not include substantive provisions on open internet access or roaming and is without prejudice
to the allocation of competences to national regulatory authorities in Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (2) and in Regulation (EU) 2015/2120. However, this Directive provides, in
addition, for national regulatory authorities to be competent for assessing and monitoring closely market access and
competition issues which potentially affect the rights of end-users to an open internet access.

(37)

The independence of the national regulatory authorities was strengthened in the review of the electronic
communications regulatory framework completed in 2009 in order to ensure a more effective application of the
regulatory framework and to increase their authority and the predictability of their decisions. To that end, express
provision had to be made in national law to ensure that, in the exercise of its tasks, a national regulatory authority is
protected against external intervention or political pressure liable to jeopardise its independent assessment of matters
coming before it. Such outside influence makes a national legislative body unsuited to act as a national regulatory
authority under the regulatory framework. For that purpose, rules had to be laid down at the outset regarding the

Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012 on roaming on public mobile
communications networks within the Union (OJ L 172, 30.6.2012, p. 10).

grounds for the dismissal of the head of the national regulatory authority in order to remove any reasonable doubt
as to the neutrality of that body and its imperviousness to external factors. In order to avoid arbitrary dismissals,
dismissed members should have the right to request that the competent courts verify the existence of a valid reason
to dismiss, among those provided for in this Directive. Such dismissals should relate only to the personal or
professional qualifications of the head or member. It is important that national regulatory authorities have their own
budget allowing them, in particular, to recruit a sufficient number of qualified staff. In order to ensure transparency,
that budget should be published annually. Within the limits of their budget, they should have autonomy in managing
their resources, human and financial. In order to ensure impartiality, Member States that retain ownership of, or
control, undertakings contributing to the budget of the national regulatory or other competent authorities through
administrative charges should ensure that there is effective structural separation of activities associated with the
exercise of ownership or control from the exercise of control over the budget.

(38)

There is a need to further reinforce the independence of the national regulatory authorities to ensure the
imperviousness of its head and members to external pressure, by providing minimum appointment qualifications,
and a minimum duration for their mandate. Furthermore, to address the risk of regulatory capture, ensure continuity
and enhance independence, Member States should consider limiting the possibility of renewing the mandates of the
head or members of the board and set up an appropriate rotation scheme for the board and the top management.
This could be arranged, for instance, by appointing the first members of the collegiate body for different periods in
order for their mandates, as well as that of their successors, not to lapse at the same moment.

(39)

National regulatory authorities should be accountable for, and should be required to report on, the way in which
they are exercising their tasks. That obligation should normally take the form of an annual reporting obligation
rather than ad hoc reporting requests, which, if disproportionate, could limit their independence or hinder them in
the exercise of their tasks. Indeed, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice (1), extensive or unconditional
reporting obligations may indirectly affect the independence of an authority.

(40)

Member States should notify the Commission of the identity of the national regulatory and other competent
authorities. For authorities competent for granting rights of way, it should be possible to fulfil the notification
requirement by a reference to the single information point established pursuant to Directive 2014/61/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council (2).

(41)

The least onerous authorisation system possible should be used to allow the provision of electronic communications
networks and services in order to stimulate the development of new communications services and pan-European
communications networks and services and to allow service providers and consumers to benefit from the economies
of scale of the internal market.

(42)

The benefits of the internal market to service providers and end-users can be best achieved by general authorisation
of electronic communications networks and of electronic communications services other than number-independent
interpersonal communications services, without requiring any explicit decision or administrative act by the national
regulatory authority and by limiting any procedural requirements to a declaratory notification only. Where
Member States require notification by providers of electronic communications networks or services when they start
their activities, such notification should not entail administrative cost for the providers and could be made available
via an entry point at the website of the competent authorities. In order to support effective cross-border
coordination, in particular for pan-European operators, BEREC should establish and maintain a database of such
notifications. Competent authorities should transmit only complete notifications to BEREC. Member States should
not impede the provision of networks or services in any way, including on grounds of incompleteness of a
notification.

(43)

Notifications should entail a mere declaration of the provider’s intention to commence the provision of electronic
communications networks and services. A provider should be required to complement that declaration only with the
information set out in this Directive. Member States should not impose additional or separate notification
requirements.

(44)

Contrary to the other categories of electronic communications networks and services as defined in this Directive,
number-independent interpersonal communications services do not benefit from the use of public numbering
resources and do not participate in a publicly assured interoperable ecosystem. It is therefore not appropriate to
subject those types of services to the general authorisation regime.

(45)

When granting rights of use for radio spectrum, for numbering resources or rights to install facilities, the competent
authorities should inform the undertakings to which they grant such rights of the relevant conditions.
Member States should be able to lay down such conditions for the use of radio spectrum in individual rights of use
or in the general authorisation.

(46)

General authorisations should contain only conditions which are specific to the electronic communications sector.
They should not be made subject to conditions which are already applicable by virtue of other existing national law,
in particular regarding consumer protection, which is not specific to the communications sector. For instance,
competent authorities should be able to inform undertakings about the applicable environmental and town-andcountry-planning requirements. Conditions imposed under the general authorisation do not affect the determination
of applicable law pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1).

(47)

The conditions that could be attached to general authorisations should cover specific conditions governing
accessibility for end-users with disabilities and the need of public authorities and emergency services to
communicate between themselves and with the general public before, during and after major disasters.

(48)

It is necessary to include the rights and obligations of undertakings under general authorisations explicitly in such
authorisations in order to ensure a level playing field throughout the Union and to facilitate cross-border negotiation
of interconnection between public electronic communications networks.

(49)

General authorisations entitle undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services to the
public to negotiate interconnection under the conditions of this Directive. Undertakings providing electronic
communications networks and services other than to the public can negotiate interconnection on commercial terms.

(50)

Competent authorities should duly take into account, when attaching conditions to general authorisations and
applying administrative charges, situations in which electronic communications networks or services are provided
by natural persons on a not-for-profit basis. In the case of electronic communications networks and services not
provided to the public it is appropriate to impose fewer and lighter conditions, if any, than are justified for electronic
communications networks and services provided to the public.

(51)

Specific obligations imposed on undertakings providing electronic communications networks and electronic
communications services in accordance with Union law by virtue of their designation as having significant market
power as defined in this Directive should be imposed separately from the general rights and obligations under the
general authorisation.

(52)

It is possible that undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services need confirmation of
their rights under the general authorisation with respect to interconnection and rights of way, in particular to
facilitate negotiations with other, regional or local, levels of government or with service providers in other
Member States. To that end competent authorities should provide declarations to undertakings either upon request
or alternatively as an automatic response to a notification under the general authorisation. Such declarations should
not by themselves constitute entitlements to rights, nor should any rights under the general authorisation, rights of
use or the exercise of such rights depend upon a declaration.

Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual
obligations (Rome I) (OJ L 177, 4.7.2008, p. 6).

L 321/46

(53)

It should be possible to impose administrative charges on undertakings providing electronic communications
services in order to finance the activities of the national regulatory or other competent authority in managing the
general authorisation system and the granting of rights of use. Such charges should be limited to cover the actual
administrative costs for those activities. To that end, transparency should be ensured in the income and expenditure
of national regulatory and other competent authorities by means of annual reporting about the total sum of charges
collected and the administrative costs incurred, in order to allow undertakings to verify that they are in balance.

(54)

Systems for administrative charges should not distort competition or create barriers to market entry. A general
authorisation system renders it impossible to attribute administrative costs and hence charges to individual
undertakings, except for the granting of rights of use for numbering resources, radio spectrum and for rights to
install facilities. Any applicable administrative charges should be in line with the principles of a general authorisation
system. An example of a fair, simple and transparent alternative for those charge attribution criteria could be a
turnover related distribution key. Where administrative charges are very low, flat rate charges, or charges combining
a flat rate basis with a turnover related element could also be appropriate. To the extent that the general
authorisation system extends to undertakings with very small market shares, such as community-based network
providers, or to service providers the business model of which generates very limited revenues even in the case of
significant market penetration in terms of volumes, Member States should assess the possibility to establish an
appropriate de minimis threshold for the imposition of administrative charges.

(55)

Member States might need to amend rights, conditions, procedures, charges and fees relating to general
authorisations and rights of use where this is objectively justified. Such proposed amendments should be duly
notified to all interested parties in good time, giving them adequate opportunity to express their views. Unnecessary
procedures should be avoided in the case of minor amendments to existing rights to install facilities or rights of use
for radio spectrum or for numbering resources when such amendments do not have an impact on third parties’
interests. Minor amendments to rights and obligations are amendments which are mainly administrative, do not
change the substantial nature of the general authorisations and the individual rights of use and thus cannot generate
any competitive advantage over other undertakings.

(56)

Considering the importance of ensuring legal certainty and in order to promote regulatory predictability to provide a
safe environment for investments, in particular for new wireless broadband communications, any restriction or
withdrawal of any existing rights of use for radio spectrum or for numbering resources or right to install facilities
should be subject to predictable and transparent justifications and procedures. Hence, stricter requirements or a
notification mechanism could be imposed in particular where rights of use have been assigned pursuant to
competitive or comparative procedures and in the case of harmonised radio spectrum bands to be used for wireless
broadband electronic communications services (‘wireless broadband services’). Justifications referring to effective and
efficient use of radio spectrum and technological evolution could rely on technical implementing measures adopted
under Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Furthermore, except where
proposed amendments are minor, where general authorisations and individual rights of use for radio spectrum need
to be restricted, withdrawn or amended without the consent of the holder of the right, this can take place after
consulting interested parties. As restrictions or withdrawals of general authorisations or rights may have significant
consequences for their holders, the competent authorities should take particular care and assess in advance the
potential harm that such measures may cause before adopting such measures.

(57)

National regulatory authorities, other competent authorities and BEREC need to gather information from market
players in order to carry out their tasks effectively, including assessing the compliance of general terms and
conditions with this Directive without suspending the applicability of those terms and conditions during the

(1)

Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio
spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) (OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1).

17.12.2018

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/47

assessment. It may, by way of exception, also be necessary to gather information from other undertakings active in
sectors that are closely related to the electronic communications services sector, such as content providers, that hold
information which could be necessary for them to exercise their tasks under Union law. It might also be necessary to
gather such information on behalf of the Commission, to allow it to fulfil its respective obligations under Union law.
Requests for information should be proportionate and not impose an undue burden on undertakings. Information
gathered by national regulatory and other competent authorities should be publicly available, except in so far as it is
confidential in accordance with national rules on public access to information and subject to Union and national
rules on commercial confidentiality.

(58)

In order to ensure that national regulatory authorities carry out their regulatory tasks in an effective manner, the
data which they gather should include accounting data on the retail markets that are associated with wholesale
markets where an undertaking is designated as having significant market power and as such are regulated by the
national regulatory authority. The data should also include data which enable the national regulatory authority to
assess compliance with conditions attached to rights of use, the possible impact of planned upgrades or changes to
network topology on the development of competition or on wholesale products made available to other parties.
Information regarding compliance with coverage obligations attached to rights of use for radio spectrum is key to
ensure completeness of the geographical surveys of network deployments. In that respect, the competent authority
should be able to require that information is provided at disaggregated local level with a granularity adequate to
conduct a geographical survey of networks.

(59)

To alleviate the burden of reporting and information obligations for network and service providers and the
competent authority concerned, such obligations should be proportionate, objectively justified and limited to what is
strictly necessary. In particular, duplication of requests for information by the competent authority and by BEREC,
and the systematic and regular proof of compliance with all conditions under a general authorisation or a right of
use, should be avoided. Undertakings should be aware of the intended use of the information sought. Provision of
information should not be a condition for market access. For statistical purposes, a notification may be required
from providers of electronic communications networks or services when they cease activities.

(60)

Member States’ obligations to provide information for the defence of Union interests under international agreements
as well as reporting obligations under law that is not specific to the electronic communications sector such as
competition law should not be affected.

(61)

It should be possible to exchange information that is considered to be confidential by a competent authority, in
accordance with Union and national rules on commercial confidentiality and on the protection of personal data,
with the Commission, BEREC and any other authorities where such exchange is necessary for the application of
national law transposing this Directive. The information exchanged should be limited to that which is relevant and
proportionate to the purpose of such an exchange.

(62)

Electronic communications broadband networks are becoming increasingly diverse in terms of technology,
topology, medium used and ownership. Therefore, regulatory intervention must rely on detailed information
regarding network roll-out in order to be effective and to target the areas where it is needed. That information is
essential for the purpose of promoting investment, increasing connectivity across the Union and providing
information to all relevant authorities and citizens. It should include surveys regarding both deployment of very high
capacity networks, as well as significant upgrades or extensions of existing copper or other networks which might
not match the performance characteristics of very high capacity networks in all respects, such as roll-out of fibre to
the cabinet coupled with active technologies like vectoring. The relevant forecasts should concern periods of up to
three years. The level of detail and territorial granularity of the information that competent authorities should gather
should be guided by the specific regulatory objective, and should be adequate for the regulatory purposes that it
serves. Therefore, the size of the territorial unit will also vary between Member States, depending on the regulatory
needs in the specific national circumstances, and on the availability of local data. Level 3 in the Nomenclature of
Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is unlikely to be a sufficiently small territorial unit in most circumstances.

L 321/48

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

National regulatory and other competent authorities should be guided by BEREC guidelines on best practice to
approach such a task, and such guidelines will be able to rely on the existing experience of national regulatory and/or
other competent authorities in conducting geographical surveys of networks roll-out. Without prejudice to
commercial confidentiality requirements, competent authorities should, where the information is not already
available on the market, make data directly accessible in an open format in accordance with Directive 2003/98/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council (1) and without restrictions on reuse the information gathered in such
surveys and should make available tools to end-users as regards quality of service to contribute towards the
improvement of their awareness of the available connectivity services. In gathering any of that information, all
authorities concerned should respect the principle of confidentiality, and should avoid causing a competitive
disadvantage to any undertaking.

(63)

Bridging the digital divide in the Union is essential to enable all citizens of the Union to have access to the internet
and digital services. To that end, in the case of specific and well-defined areas, the relevant authorities should have
the possibility to invite undertakings and public authorities to declare their intention to deploy very high capacity
networks in these areas, allowing them sufficient time to provide a thoroughly considered response. The information
included in the forecasts should reflect the economic prospects of the electronic communications networks sector
and investment intentions of undertakings at the time when the data are gathered, in order to allow the identification
of available connectivity in different areas. Where an undertaking or public authority declares an intention to deploy
in an area, the national regulatory or other competent authority should be able to require other undertakings and
public authorities to declare whether or not they intend to deploy very high capacity networks, or significantly
upgrade or extend their network to a performance of at least 100 Mbps download speeds in this area. That
procedure will create transparency for undertakings and public authorities that have expressed their interest in
deploying in this area, so that, when designing their business plans, they can assess the likely competition that they
will face from other networks. The positive effect of such transparency relies on market participants responding
truthfully and in good faith.

(64)

While market participants can change their deployment plans for unforeseen, objective and justifiable reasons,
competent authorities should intervene, including if public funding is affected, and, where appropriate, impose
penalties if they have been provided, knowingly or due to gross negligence, by an undertaking or public authority
with misleading erroneous or incomplete information. For the purpose of the relevant provisions on penalties, gross
negligence should refer to a situation where an undertaking or a public authority provides misleading, erroneous or
incomplete information due to its behaviour or internal organisation which falls significantly below due diligence
regarding the information provided. Gross negligence should not require that the undertaking or public authority
knows that the information provided is misleading, erroneous or incomplete, but, rather, that it would have known,
had it acted or been organised with due diligence. It is important that the penalties are sufficiently dissuasive in light
of the negative impact on competition and on publicly funded projects. The provisions on penalties should be
without prejudice to any rights to claim compensation for damages in accordance with national law.

(65)

In the interests of predictable investment conditions, competent authorities should be able to share information with
undertakings and public authorities expressing interest in deploying very high capacity networks on whether other
types of network upgrades, including those below 100 Mbps download speed, are present or foreseen in the area in
question.

(66)

It is important that national regulatory and other competent authorities consult all interested parties on proposed
decisions, give them sufficient time to the complexity of the matter to provide their comments, and take account of
their comments before adopting a final decision. In order to ensure that decisions at national level do not have an
adverse effect on the functioning of the internal market or other TFEU objectives, national regulatory authorities
should also notify certain draft decisions to the Commission and other national regulatory authorities to give them
the opportunity to comment. It is appropriate for competent authorities to consult interested parties in the cases
defined in this Directive on all draft measures which have an effect on trade between Member States.

(1)

Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector
information (OJ L 345, 31.12.2003, p. 90).

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/49

(67)

In the context of a competitive environment, the views of interested parties, including users and consumers, should
be taken into account. In order to appropriately address the interests of citizens, Member States should put in place
an appropriate consultation mechanism. Such a mechanism could take the form of a body which would,
independently of the national regulatory authority and service providers, carry out research into consumer-related
issues, such as consumer behaviour and mechanisms for changing suppliers, and which would operate in a
transparent manner and contribute to the existing mechanisms for stakeholder consultation. Furthermore, a
mechanism could be established for the purpose of enabling appropriate cooperation on issues relating to the
promotion of lawful content. Any cooperation procedures agreed pursuant to such a mechanism should, however,
not allow for the systematic surveillance of internet use.

(68)

Out-of-court dispute resolution procedures may constitute a fast and cost-efficient way for end-users to enforce their
rights, in particular for consumers and microenterprises and small enterprises as defined in the Annex to
Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (1). Member States should enable the national regulatory authority or
another competent authority responsible for, or at least one independent body with proven expertise in dealing with,
end-user rights to act as an alternative dispute resolution entity. With respect to such dispute resolutions, those
authorities should not be subject to any instructions. As many Member States have established dispute resolution
procedures also for end-users other than consumers, to whom Directive 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament
and of the Council (2) does not apply, it is reasonable to maintain the sector-specific dispute resolution procedure for
both consumers and, where Member States extend it, also for other end-users, in particular microenterprises and
small enterprises. In relation to out-of-court dispute resolution, Member States should be able to maintain or
introduce rules that go beyond those laid down by Directive 2013/11/EU in order to ensure a higher level of
consumer protection.

(69)

In the event of a dispute between undertakings in the same Member State in an area covered by this Directive, for
example relating to obligations for access and interconnection or to the means of transferring end-user lists, an
aggrieved party that has negotiated in good faith but failed to reach agreement should be able to call on the national
regulatory authority to resolve the dispute. National regulatory authorities should be able to impose a solution on
the parties. The intervention of a national regulatory authority in the resolution of a dispute between providers of
electronic communications networks or services or associated facilities in a Member State should seek to ensure
compliance with the obligations arising under this Directive.

(70)

In addition to the rights of recourse granted under Union or national law, there is a need for a simple procedure to be
initiated at the request of either party in a dispute, to resolve cross-border disputes between undertakings providing,
or authorised to provide, electronic communications networks or services in different Member States.

(71)

One important task assigned to BEREC is to adopt, where appropriate, opinions in relation to cross-border disputes.
National regulatory authorities should therefore fully reflect any opinion submitted by BEREC in their measures
imposing any obligation on an undertaking or otherwise resolving the dispute in such cases.

(72)

Lack of coordination between Member States when organising the use of radio spectrum in their territory can, if not
solved through bilateral Member States negotiations, create large-scale interference issues severely impacting on the
development of the Digital Single Market. Member States should take all necessary measures to avoid cross-border
and harmful interference between them. The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) established by Commission
Decision 2002/622/EC (3) should be tasked with supporting the necessary cross-border coordination and be the

enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36).

(OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, p. 63).

EN

designated forum for resolving disputes between Member States on cross border issues. Building on the RSPG’s
proposed solution, an implementing measure is required in some circumstances to resolve cross-border interference
definitively or to enforce under Union law a coordinated solution agreed by two or several Member States in bilateral
negotiations. Lack of coordination between Member States and countries neighbouring the Union can also create
large-scale interference issues. Member States should take appropriate measures to avoid cross-border and harmful
interference with countries neighbouring the Union, and cooperate with each other to that end. Upon the request of
Member States affected by cross-border interference from third countries, the Union should provide its full support
for those Member States.

(73)

The RSPG is a Commission high-level advisory group which was created by Decision 2002/622/EC to contribute to
the development of the internal market and to support the development of a Union-level radio spectrum policy,
taking into account economic, political, cultural, strategic, health and social considerations, as well as technical
parameters. It should be composed of the heads of the bodies that have overall political responsibility for strategic
radio spectrum policy. It should assist and advise the Commission with respect to radio spectrum policy. This should
further increase the visibility of radio spectrum policy in the various Union policy areas and help to ensure crosssectorial consistency at Union and national and level. It should also provide advice to the European Parliament and
to the Council upon their request. Moreover, the RSPG should also be the forum for the coordination of
implementation by Member States of their obligations related to radio spectrum under this Directive and should play
a central role in fields essential for the internal market such as cross-border coordination or standardisation.
Technical or expert working groups could also be created to assist plenary meetings, at which strategic policy is
framed through senior-level representatives of the Member States and the Commission. The Commission has
indicated its intention to amend Decision 2002/622/EC within six months of the entry into force of this Directive, in
order to reflect the new tasks conferred on the RSPG by this Directive.

(74)

Competent authorities should monitor and secure compliance with the terms and conditions of the general
authorisation and rights of use, and in particular to ensure effective and efficient use of radio spectrum and
compliance with coverage and quality of service obligations, through administrative penalties including financial
penalties and injunctions and withdrawals of rights of use in the event of breaches of those terms and conditions.
Undertakings should provide the most accurate and complete information possible to competent authorities to
allow them to fulfil their surveillance tasks.

(75)

The conditions attached to general authorisations and individual rights of use should be limited to those strictly
necessary to ensure compliance with requirements and obligations under national law and Union law.

(76)

Any party subject to a decision of a competent authority should have the right to appeal to a body that is
independent of the parties involved and of any external intervention or political pressure which could jeopardise its
independent assessment of matters coming before it. That body can be a court. Furthermore, any undertaking which
considers that its applications for the granting of rights to install facilities have not been dealt with in accordance
with the principles set out in this Directive should be entitled to appeal against such decisions. That appeal
procedure should be without prejudice to the division of competences within national judicial systems and to the
rights of legal entities or natural persons under national law. In any case, Member States should grant effective
judicial review against such decisions.

(77)

In order to ensure legal certainty for market players, appeal bodies should carry out their functions effectively. In
particular, appeal proceedings should not be unduly lengthy. Interim measures suspending the effect of the decision
of a competent authority should be granted only in urgent cases in order to prevent serious and irreparable damage
to the party applying for those measures and if the balance of interests so requires.

(78)

There has been a wide divergence in the manner in which appeal bodies have applied interim measures to suspend
the decisions of the national regulatory or other competent authorities. In order to achieve greater consistency of
approach common standards should be applied in line with the case law of the Court of Justice. Appeal bodies

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/51

should also be entitled to request available information published by BEREC. Given the importance of appeals for the
overall operation of the regulatory framework, a mechanism should be set up, in all the Member States, for collecting
information on appeals and decisions to suspend decisions taken by the competent authorities and for the reporting
of that information to the Commission and to BEREC. That mechanism should ensure that the Commission or
BEREC can retrieve from Member States the text of the decisions and judgments with a view to developing a
database.

(79)

Transparency in the application of the Union mechanism for consolidating the internal market for electronic
communications should be increased in the interest of citizens and stakeholders and to enable parties concerned to
make their views known, including by way of requiring national regulatory authorities to publish any draft measure
at the same time as it is communicated to the Commission, to BEREC, and to the national regulatory authorities in
other Member States. Any such draft measure should be reasoned and should contain a detailed analysis.

(80)

The Commission should be able, after taking utmost account of the opinion of BEREC, to require a national
regulatory authority to withdraw a draft measure where it concerns the definition of relevant markets or the
designation of undertakings as having significant market power, and where such decisions would create a barrier to
the internal market or would be incompatible with Union law and in particular the policy objectives that national
regulatory authorities should follow. This procedure is without prejudice to the notification procedure provided for
in Directive (EU) 2015/1535 and the Commission’s prerogatives under TFEU in respect of infringements of Union
law.

(81)

The national consultation of interested parties should be conducted prior to the consultation at Union level for the
purposes of consolidating the internal market for electronic communications and within the procedure for the
consistent application of remedies, in order to allow the views of interested parties to be reflected in the consultation
at Union level. This would also avoid the need for a second consultation at Union level in the event of changes to a
planned measure as a result of the national consultation.

(82)

It is important that the regulatory framework is implemented in a timely manner. When the Commission has taken a
decision requiring a national regulatory authority to withdraw a planned measure, national regulatory authorities
should withdraw its draft measure or submit a revised measure to the Commission. A deadline should be laid down
for the notification of the revised measure to the Commission in order to inform market players of the duration of
the market review and in order to increase legal certainty.

(83)

The Union mechanism allowing the Commission to require national regulatory authorities to withdraw planned
measures concerning market definition and the designation of undertakings as having significant market power has
contributed significantly to a consistent approach in identifying the circumstances in which ex ante regulation may
be applied and those in which the undertakings are subject to such regulation. The experience of the procedures
under Articles 7 and 7a of Directive 2002/21/EC has shown that inconsistencies in the national regulatory
authorities’ application of remedies under similar market conditions undermine the internal market in electronic
communications. Therefore, the Commission and BEREC should participate in ensuring, within their respective
responsibilities, a higher level of consistency in the application of remedies concerning draft measures proposed by
national regulatory authorities. In addition, for draft measures relating to the extension of obligations beyond the
first concentration or distribution point, where needed to address high and non-transitory economic or physical
barriers to replication, on undertakings irrespective of a designation as having significant market power, or to the
regulatory treatment of new very high-capacity network elements where BEREC shares the Commission’s concerns,
the Commission should be able to require a national regulatory authority to withdraw a draft measure. In order to
benefit from the expertise of national regulatory authorities on the market analysis, the Commission should consult
BEREC prior to adoption of its decisions or recommendations.

(84)

Having regard to the short time-limits in the consultation mechanism at Union level, powers should be conferred on
the Commission to adopt recommendations or guidelines to simplify the procedures for exchanging information
between the Commission and national regulatory authorities, for example in cases concerning stable markets, or
involving only minor changes to previously notified measures. Powers should also be conferred on the Commission
in order to allow for the introduction of a notification exemption in order to streamline procedures in certain cases.

National regulatory authorities should be required to cooperate with each other, with BEREC and with the
Commission, in a transparent manner, to ensure the consistent application, in all Member States, of this Directive.

(86)

The discretion of national regulatory authorities needs to be reconciled with the development of consistent
regulatory practices and the consistent application of the regulatory framework in order to contribute effectively to
the development and completion of the internal market. National regulatory authorities should therefore support
the internal market activities of the Commission and of BEREC.

(87)

Measures that could affect trade between Member States are measures that could have an influence, direct or indirect,
actual or potential, on the pattern of trade between Member States in a manner which might create a barrier to the
internal market. They comprise measures that have a significant impact on undertakings or users in other
Member States, which include: measures which affect prices for users in other Member States; measures which affect
the ability of an undertaking established in another Member State to provide an electronic communications service,
and in particular measures which affect the ability to offer services on a transnational basis; and measures which
affect market structure or access, leading to repercussions for undertakings in other Member States.

(88)

A more convergent use and definition of elements of selection procedures and the conditions attached to the rights
of use for radio spectrum which have a significant impact on market conditions and the competitive situation,
including conditions for entry and expansion, would be enhanced by a coordination mechanism whereby the RSPG,
at the request of the national regulatory or other competent authority or, exceptionally, on its own initiative,
convenes a Peer Review Forum to examine draft measures in advance of the granting of rights of use by a given
Member State with a view to exchanging best practices. The Peer Review Forum is an instrument of peer learning. It
should contribute to a better exchange of best practices between Member States and increase the transparency of the
competitive or comparative selection procedures. The Peer Review Process should not be a formal condition of
national authorisation procedures. The exchange of views should be based on information provided by the national
regulatory or other competent authority that requests the Peer Review Forum and should be a subset of a wider
national measure, which may more broadly consist of the granting, trade and lease, duration, renewal or the
amendment of rights of use. Therefore, the national regulatory or other competent authority should also be able to
provide information on other draft national measures or aspects thereof related to the relevant selection procedure
for limiting rights of use for radio spectrum which are not covered by the peer review mechanism. To reduce
administrative burden, the national regulatory or other competent authority should be able to submit such
information by way of a common reporting format, where available, for transmission to the RSPG members.

(89)

Where the harmonised assignment of radio spectrum to particular undertakings has been agreed at Union level,
Member States should strictly implement such agreements in the granting of rights of use for radio spectrum from
the National Frequency Allocation Plan.

(90)

Member States should be able to consider joint authorisation processes as an option when issuing rights of use
where the expected usage covers cross-border situations.

(91)

Any Commission decision to ensure the harmonised application of this Directive should be limited to regulatory
principles, approaches and methodologies. For the avoidance of doubt, it should not prescribe any detail normally
required to reflect national circumstances, and it should not prohibit alternative approaches which can reasonably be
expected to have equivalent effect. Such a decision should be proportionate and should not have an effect on
decisions taken by national regulatory or other competent authorities that do not create a barrier to the internal
market.

(92)

The Union and the Member States have entered into commitments in relation to standards and the regulatory
framework of telecommunications networks and services in the World Trade Organization.

17.12.2018

(93)

Standardisation should remain primarily a market-driven process. However there may still be situations where it is
appropriate to require compliance with specified standards at Union level in order to improve interoperability,
freedom of choice for users and encourage interconnectivity in the internal market. At national level, Member States
are subject to Directive (EU) 2015/1535. Standardisation procedures under this Directive are without prejudice to
Directives 2014/30/EU (1) and 2014/35/EU (2) of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Directive 2014/
53/EU.

(94)

Providers of public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services,
or of both, should be required to take measures to safeguard the security of their networks and services, respectively,
and to prevent or minimise the impact of security incidents. Having regard to the state of the art, those measures
should ensure a level of security of networks and services appropriate to the risks posed. Security measures should
take into account, as a minimum, all the relevant aspects of the following elements: as regards security of networks
and facilities: physical and environmental security, security of supply, access control to networks and integrity of
networks; as regards handling of security incidents: handling procedures, security incident detection capability,
security incident reporting and communication; as regards business continuity management: service continuity
strategy and contingency plans, disaster recovery capabilities; as regards monitoring, auditing and testing:
monitoring and logging policies, exercise contingency plans, network and service testing, security assessments and
compliance monitoring; and compliance with international standards.

(95)

Given the growing importance of number-independent interpersonal communications services, it is necessary to
ensure that they are also subject to appropriate security requirements in accordance with their specific nature and
economic importance. Providers of such services should thus also ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk
posed. Given that providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services normally do not
exercise actual control over the transmission of signals over networks, the degree of risk for such services can be
considered in some respects to be lower than for traditional electronic communications services. Therefore, where
justified on the basis of the actual assessment of the security risks involved, the measures taken by providers of
number-independent interpersonal communications services should be lighter. The same approach should apply
mutatis mutandis to interpersonal communications services which make use of numbers and which do not exercise
actual control over signal transmission.

(96)

Providers of public electronic communications networks or of publicly available electronic communications services
should inform users of particular and significant security threats and of measures they can take to protect the
security of their communications, for instance by using specific types of software or encryption technologies. The
requirement to inform users of such threats should not discharge a service provider from the obligation to take, at its
own expense, appropriate and immediate measures to remedy any security threats and restore the normal security
level of the service. The provision of such information about security threats to the user should be free of charge.

(97)

In order to safeguard security of networks and services, and without prejudice to the Member States’ powers to
ensure the protection of their essential security interests and public security, and to permit the investigation,
detection and prosecution of criminal offences, the use of encryption for example, end-to-end where appropriate,
should be promoted and, where necessary, encryption should be mandatory in accordance with the principles of
security and privacy by default and by design.

(98)

Competent authorities should ensure that the integrity and availability of public electronic communications
networks are maintained. The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (‘ENISA’) should
contribute to an enhanced level of security of electronic communications by, inter alia, providing expertise and
advice, and promoting the exchange of best practices. The competent authorities should have the necessary means to

perform their duties, including powers to request the information necessary to assess the level of security of
networks or services. They should also have the power to request comprehensive and reliable data about actual
security incidents that have had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services. They should, where
necessary, be assisted by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (‘CSIRTs’) established by Directive (EU) 2016/
1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). In particular, CSIRTs may be required to provide competent
authorities with information about risks and security incidents affecting public electronic communications networks
and publicly available electronic communications services, and recommend ways to address them.

(99)

Where the provision of electronic communications relies on public resources the use of which is subject to specific
authorisation, Member States should be able to grant the authority competent for issuance thereof the right to
impose fees to ensure optimal use of those resources, in accordance with the procedures envisaged in this Directive.
In line with the case-law of the Court of Justice, Member States cannot levy any charges or fees in relation to the
provision of networks and electronic communications services other than those provided for by this Directive. In
that regard, Member States should have a consistent approach in establishing those charges or fees in order not to
provide an undue financial burden linked to the general authorisation procedure or rights of use for providers of
electronic communications networks and services.

(100) To ensure optimal use of resources, fees should reflect the economic and technical situation of the market concerned

as well as any other significant factor determining their value. At the same time, fees should be set in a manner that
ensures efficient assignment and use of radio spectrum. This Directive is without prejudice to the purpose for which
fees for rights of use and rights to install facilities are employed. It should be possible, for example, to use such fees to
finance activities of national regulatory and other competent authorities that cannot be covered by administrative
charges. Where, in the case of competitive or comparative selection procedures, fees for rights of use for radio
spectrum consist entirely or partly of a one-off amount, payment arrangements should ensure that such fees do not
in practice lead to selection on the basis of criteria unrelated to the objective of ensuring optimal use of radio
spectrum. The Commission should be able to publish, on a regular basis, benchmark studies and, as appropriate,
other guidance with regard to best practices for the assignment of radio spectrum, the assignment of numbering
resources or the granting of rights of way.

(101) Fees imposed on undertakings for rights of use for radio spectrum can influence decisions about whether to seek

such rights and put into use radio spectrum resources. With a view to ensuring optimal use of radio spectrum,
Member States should therefore set reserve prices in a way that leads to the efficient assignment of those rights,
irrespective of the type of selection procedure used. Member States could also take into account possible costs
associated with the fulfilment of authorisation conditions imposed to further policy objectives. In doing so, regard
should also be had to the competitive situation of the market concerned including the possible alternative uses of the
resources.

(102) Optimal use of radio spectrum resources depends on the availability of appropriate networks and associated

facilities. In that regard, Member States should aim to ensure that, where national regulatory or other competent
authorities apply fees for rights of use for radio spectrum and for rights to install facilities, they take into
consideration the need to facilitate continuous infrastructure development with a view to achieving the most
efficient use of the resources. Member States should seek to ensure the application, to the best extent possible, of
arrangements for the payment of the fees for rights of use for radio spectrum linked with the actual availability of
the resource in a manner that supports the investments necessary to promote such infrastructure development and
the provision of related services. The payment arrangements should be specified in an objective, transparent,
proportionate and non-discriminatory manner before opening procedures for the granting of rights of use for radio
spectrum.

(103) It should be ensured that procedures exist for the granting of rights to install facilities that are timely, non-

discriminatory and transparent, in order to guarantee the conditions for fair and effective competition. This Directive
is without prejudice to national provisions governing the expropriation or use of property, the normal exercise of
property rights, the normal use of the public domain, or to the principle of neutrality with regard to the rules in
Member States governing the system of property ownership.

Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common
level of security of network and information systems across the Union (OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1).

17.12.2018

L 321/55

(104) Permits issued to providers of electronic communications networks and services allowing them to gain access to

public or private property are essential factors for the establishment of electronic communications networks or new
network elements. Unnecessary complexity and delay in the procedures for granting rights of way may therefore
represent important obstacles to the development of competition. Consequently, the acquisition of rights of way by
authorised undertakings should be simplified. Competent authorities should coordinate the acquisition of rights of
way, making relevant information accessible on their websites.

(105) It is necessary to strengthen the powers of the Member States as regards holders of rights of way to ensure the entry

or roll-out of a new network in a fair, efficient and environmentally responsible way and independently of any
obligation on an undertaking designated as having significant market power to grant access to its electronic
communications network. Improving facility sharing can lower the environmental cost of deploying electronic
communications infrastructure and serve public health, public security and meet town and country planning
objectives. Competent authorities should be empowered to require that the undertakings which have benefitted from
rights to install facilities on, over or under public or private property share such facilities or property, including
physical co-location, after an appropriate period of public consultation, during which all interested parties should be
given the opportunity to state their views, in the specific areas where such general interest reasons impose such
sharing. That can be the case for instance where the subsoil is highly congested or where a natural barrier needs to
be crossed. Competent authorities should in particular be able to impose the sharing of network elements and
associated facilities, such as ducts, conduits, masts, manholes, cabinets, antennae, towers and other supporting
constructions, buildings or entries into buildings, and a better coordination of civil works on environmental or other
public policy grounds. On the contrary, it should be for national regulatory authorities to define rules for
apportioning the costs of the facility or property sharing, to ensure that there is an appropriate reward of risk for the
undertakings concerned. In light of the obligations imposed by Directive 2014/61/EU, the competent authorities, in
particular, local authorities, should also establish appropriate coordination procedures, in cooperation with national
regulatory authorities, with respect to public works and other appropriate public facilities or property which should
be able to include procedures that ensure that interested parties have information concerning appropriate public
facilities or property and ongoing and planned public works, that they are notified in a timely manner of such
works, and that sharing is facilitated to the maximum extent possible.

(106) Where mobile operators are required to share towers or masts for environmental reasons, such mandated sharing

could lead to a reduction in the maximum transmitted power levels allowed for each operator for reasons of public
health, and this in turn could require operators to install more transmission sites to ensure national coverage.
Competent authorities should seek to reconcile the environmental and public health considerations in question,
taking due account of the precautionary approach set out in Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC (1).

(107) Radio spectrum is a scarce public resource with an important public and market value. It is an essential input for

radio-based electronic communications networks and services and, insofar as it relates to such networks and
services, should therefore be efficiently allocated and assigned by national regulatory or other competent authorities
in accordance with harmonised objectives and principles governing their action as well as to objective, transparent
and non-discriminatory criteria, taking into account the democratic, social, linguistic and cultural interests related to
the use of radio spectrum. Decision No 676/2002/EC establishes a framework for harmonisation of radio spectrum.

(108) Radio spectrum policy activities in the Union should be without prejudice to measures taken, at Union or national

level, in accordance with Union law, to pursue general interest objectives, in particular with regard to public
governmental and defence networks, content regulation and audiovisual and media policies, and the right of
Member States to organise and use their radio spectrum for public order, public security and defence.

(109) Ensuring widespread connectivity in each Member State is essential for economic and social development,

participation in public life and social and territorial cohesion. As connectivity and the use of electronic
communications become an integral element to European society and welfare, Member States should strive to ensure
Union-wide wireless broadband coverage. Such coverage should be achieved by relying on the imposition by
Member States of appropriate coverage requirements, which should be adapted to each area served and limited to
proportionate burdens in order not to hinder deployment by service providers. Given the major role systems such as
radio local area networks (RLANs) play in providing high-speed wireless broadband indoors, measures should aim to
ensure the release of sufficient radio spectrum in bands which are particularly valuable assets for the cost-efficient
deployment of wireless networks with universal coverage, in particular indoors. Moreover, consistent and
coordinated measures for high-quality terrestrial wireless coverage across the Union, building on best national
practices for operators’ licence obligations, should aim to meet the radio spectrum policy programme objective that
all citizens of the Union should have access both indoors and outdoors, to the fastest broadband speeds of not less
than 30 Mbps by 2020, and should aim to achieve an ambitious vision for a gigabit society in the Union. Such
measures will promote innovative digital services and ensure long-term socioeconomic benefits. Seamless coverage
of the territory as well as connectivity across Member States should be maximised and reliable, with a view to
promoting in-border and cross-border services and applications such as connected cars and e-health.

(110) The need to ensure that citizens are not exposed to electromagnetic fields at a level harmful to public health is

imperative. Member States should pursue consistency across the Union to address this issue, having particular regard
to the precautionary approach taken in Recommendation 1999/519/EC, in order to work towards ensuring more
consistent deployment conditions. Member States should apply the procedure set out in Directive (EU) 2015/1535,
where relevant, with a view also to providing transparency to stakeholders and to allow other Member States and the
Commission to react.

(111) Radio spectrum harmonisation and coordination, and equipment regulation supported by standardisation, are

complementary and need to be coordinated closely to meet their joint objectives effectively, with the support of the
RSPG. Coordination between the content and timing of mandates to CEPT under Decision No 676/2002/EC and
standardisation requests to standardisation bodies, such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute,
including with regard to radio receivers parameters, should facilitate the introduction of future systems, support
radio spectrum sharing opportunities and ensure efficient radio spectrum management.

(112) The demand for harmonised radio spectrum is not uniform in all parts of the Union. Where there is lack of demand

for all or part of a harmonised band at regional or national level, Member States could, by way of exception, allow an
alternative use of the band, for example to cover lack of market supply for certain uses, for as long as such lack of
demand persists and provided that the alternative use does not prejudice the harmonised use of the band by other
Member States and that it ceases when demand for the harmonised use materialises.

(113) Flexibility in radio spectrum management and access to radio spectrum has been established through technology

and service-neutral authorisations to allow radio spectrum users to choose the best technologies and services to
apply in radio spectrum bands declared available for electronic communications services in the relevant National
Frequency Allocation Plans in accordance with Union law (‘the principle of technology neutrality and the principle
of service neutrality’). The administrative determination of technologies and services should apply only when general
interest objectives are at stake and should be clearly justified and subject to regular review.

(114) Restrictions to the principle of technology neutrality should be appropriate and justified by the need to avoid

harmful interference, for example by imposing emission masks and power levels, to ensure the protection of public
health by limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields, to ensure the proper functioning of services through an

17.12.2018

L 321/57

adequate level of technical quality of service, while not necessarily precluding the possibility of using more than one
service in the same radio spectrum band, to ensure proper sharing of radio spectrum, in particular where its use is
subject only to general authorisations, to safeguard efficient use of radio spectrum, or to fulfil a general interest
objective in accordance with Union law.

(115) Radio spectrum users should also be able to choose freely the services they wish to offer over the radio spectrum. On

the other hand, measures should be allowed which require the provision of a specific service to meet clearly defined
general interest objectives such as safety of life, the need to promote social, regional and territorial cohesion, or the
avoidance of the inefficient use of radio spectrum to be permitted where necessary and proportionate. Those
objectives should include the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism, as defined by
Member States in accordance with Union law. Except where necessary to protect safety of life or, by way of
exception, to fulfil other general interest objectives as defined by Member States in accordance with Union law,
exceptions should not result in certain services having exclusive use, but should rather grant them priority so that,
insofar as possible, other services or technologies could coexist in the same radio spectrum band. It lies within the
competence of the Member States to define the scope and nature of any exception regarding the promotion of
cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism.

(116) As the allocation of radio spectrum to specific technologies or services is an exception to the principles of

technology and service neutrality and reduces the freedom to choose the service provided or technology used, any
proposal for such allocation should be transparent and subject to public consultation.

(117) Where Member States decide, by way of exception, to limit the freedom to provide electronic communications

networks and services based on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, Member States should
explain the reasons for such a limitation.

(118) Radio spectrum should be managed in a manner that ensures the avoidance of harmful interference. The basic

concept of harmful interference should therefore be properly defined to ensure that regulatory intervention is limited
to the extent necessary to prevent such interference, having regard also to the need to take into consideration
advanced methods for protection against harmful interference, with the aim of applying those technologies and
radio spectrum management methods in order to avoid, to the extent possible, the application of the noninterference and non-protection principle. Transport has a strong cross-border element and its digitalisation brings
challenges. Vehicles (such as metro, bus, cars, trucks, trains,) are becoming increasingly autonomous and connected.
In the internal market, vehicles travel beyond national borders more easily. Reliable communications, and avoiding
harmful interference, are critical for the safe and good operation of vehicles and their on-board communications
systems.

(119) With growing radio spectrum demand and new varying applications and technologies which necessitate more

flexible access and use of radio spectrum, Member States should promote the shared use of radio spectrum by
determining the most appropriate authorisation regimes for each scenario and by establishing appropriate and
transparent rules and conditions therefor. Shared use of radio spectrum increasingly ensures its effective and efficient
use by allowing several independent users or devices to access the same radio spectrum band under various types of
legal regimes in order to make additional radio spectrum resources available, raise usage efficiency and facilitate
radio spectrum access for new users. Shared use can be based on general authorisations or licence-exempt use
allowing, under specific sharing conditions, several users to access and use the same radio spectrum in different
geographic areas or at different moments in time. It can also be based on individual rights of use under arrangements
such as licensed shared access where all users (with an existing user and new users) agree on the terms and
conditions for shared access, under the supervision of the competent authorities, in such a way as to ensure a
minimum guaranteed radio transmission quality. When allowing shared use under different authorisation regimes,
Member States should not set widely diverging durations for such use under different authorisation regimes.

L 321/58

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(120) General authorisations for the use of radio spectrum may facilitate the most effective use of radio spectrum and

foster innovation in some cases and are pro-competitive, whereas individual rights of use for radio spectrum in other
cases may be the most appropriate authorisation regime in the presence of certain specific circumstances. Individual
rights of use should be considered, for example, when favourable propagation characteristics of the radio spectrum
or the envisaged power level of the transmission imply that general authorisations cannot address the interference
concerns in light of the required quality of service. Technical measures such as solutions to improve receiver
resilience might enable the use of general authorisations or radio spectrum sharing, and possibly avoid systematic
recourse to the non-interference and non-protection principle.

(121) In order to ensure predictability and preserve legal certainty and investment stability, Member States should

establish, in advance, appropriate criteria to determine compliance with the objective of efficient use of radio
spectrum by the holders of the rights when implementing the conditions attached to individual rights of use and
general authorisations. Interested parties should be involved in the definition of such conditions and informed, in a
transparent manner, about how the fulfilment of their obligations will be assessed.

(122) In order to avoid the creation of barriers to market entry, namely through anti-competitive hoarding, enforcement of

conditions attached to radio spectrum rights by Member States should be effective and all competent authorities
should participate where necessary. Enforcement conditions should include the application of a ‘use it or lose it’
clause. In order to ensure legal certainty in respect of the possible exposure to any penalty for failure to use radio
spectrum, thresholds of use, including in terms of time, quantity or identity of radio spectrum, should be established
in advance. Trading and leasing of radio spectrum should ensure the effective use by the original holder of the right.

(123) Where harmonised conditions for a radio spectrum band are established under Decision No 676/2002/EC,

competent authorities are to decide on the most appropriate authorisation regime to be applied in that band or parts
thereof. Where all Member States are likely to face similar problems for which diverging solutions could fragment
the internal market in equipment, and thereby delay the rollout of 5G systems, it may be necessary for the
Commission, taking utmost account of the opinion of the RSPG, to recommend common solutions, acknowledging
technical harmonisation measures in force. This could provide a common toolbox for Member States which they
could take into account when identifying appropriate consistent authorisation regimes to be applied to a band, or
part of a band, depending on factors such as population density, propagation characteristics of the bands, divergence
between urban and rural uses, the possible need to protect existing services and the resulting implications for
economies of scale in manufacturing.

(124) Network infrastructure sharing, and in some instances radio spectrum sharing, can allow for a more effective and

efficient use of radio spectrum and ensure the rapid deployment of networks, especially in less densely populated
areas. When establishing the conditions to be attached to rights of use for radio spectrum, competent authorities
should also consider authorising forms of sharing or coordination between undertakings with a view to ensuring
effective and efficient use of radio spectrum or compliance with coverage obligations, in accordance with
competition law principles.

(125) The requirement to respect the principles of technology and service neutrality in granting rights of use, together with

the possibility to transfer rights between undertakings, underpin the freedom and means to deliver electronic
communications services to the public, thereby also facilitating the achievement of general interest objectives. This
Directive is without prejudice whether radio spectrum is assigned directly to providers of electronic communications
networks or services or to entities that use those networks or services. Such entities may be radio or television
broadcast content providers. The responsibility for compliance with the conditions attached to the right of use for
radio spectrum and the relevant conditions attached to the general authorisation should in any case lie with the
undertaking to which the right of use for radio spectrum has been granted. Certain obligations imposed on
broadcasters for the delivery of audiovisual media services may require the use of specific criteria and procedures for
the granting of radio spectrum usage rights to meet a specific general interest objective set out by Member States in
accordance with Union law. However, the procedure for the granting of such right should in any event be objective,
transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/59

(126) The case-law of the Court of Justice requires that any national restrictions to the rights guaranteed by Article 56

TFEU should be objectively justified and proportionate and should not exceed those necessary to achieve their
objectives. Moreover, radio spectrum granted without following an open procedure should not be used for purposes
other than the general interest objective for which they were granted. In such a case, the interested parties should be
given the opportunity to comment within a reasonable period. As part of the application procedure for granting
rights, Member States should verify whether the applicant is able to comply with the conditions to be attached to
such rights. Those conditions should be reflected in eligibility criteria set out in objective, transparent, proportionate
and non-discriminatory terms prior to the launch of any competitive selection procedure. For the purpose of
applying such criteria, the applicant may be requested to submit the necessary information to prove his ability to
comply with those conditions. Where such information is not provided, the application for the right of use for radio
spectrum may be rejected.

(127) Member States should, prior to the granting of the right, impose only the verification of elements that can

reasonably be demonstrated by an applicant exercising ordinary care, taking due account of the important public
and market value of radio spectrum as a scarce public resource. This is without prejudice to the possibility for
subsequent verification of the fulfilment of eligibility criteria, for example through milestones, where criteria could
not reasonably be met initially. To preserve effective and efficient use of radio spectrum, Member States should not
grant rights where their review indicates applicants' inability to comply with the conditions, without prejudice to the
possibility of facilitating time-limited experimental use. Sufficiently long duration of authorisations for the use of
radio spectrum should increase investment predictability to contribute to faster network roll-out and better services,
as well as stability to support radio spectrum trading and leasing. Unless use of radio spectrum is authorised for an
unlimited period, such a duration should both take account of the objectives pursued and be sufficient to facilitate
recoupment of the investments made. While a longer duration can ensure investment predictability, measures to
ensure effective and efficient use of radio spectrum, such as the power of the competent authority to amend or
withdraw the right in the case of non-compliance with the conditions attached to the rights of use, or the facilitation
of radio spectrum tradability and leasing, will serve to prevent inappropriate accumulation of radio spectrum and
support greater flexibility in distributing radio spectrum resources. Greater recourse to annualised fees is also a
means to ensure a continuous assessment of the use of the radio spectrum by the holder of the right.

(128) Considering the importance of technical innovation, Member States should be able to provide for rights to use radio

spectrum for experimental purposes, subject to specific restrictions and conditions strictly justified by the
experimental nature of such rights.

(129) In deciding whether to renew already granted rights of use for harmonised radio spectrum, competent authorities

should take into account the extent to which renewal would further the objectives of the regulatory framework and
other objectives under Union and national law. Any such decision should be subject to an open, non-discriminatory
and transparent procedure and based on a review of how the conditions attached to the rights concerned have been
fulfilled. When assessing the need to renew rights of use, Member States should weigh the competitive impact of
renewing assigned rights against the promotion of more efficient exploitation or of innovative new uses that might
result if the band were opened to new users. Competent authorities should be able to make their determination in
this regard by allowing for only a limited duration for renewal in order to prevent severe disruption of established
use. While decisions on whether to renew rights assigned prior to the applicability of this Directive should respect
any rules already applicable, Member States should also ensure that they do not prejudice the objectives of this
Directive.

(130) When renewing existing rights of use for harmonised radio spectrum, Member States should, together with the

assessment of the need to renew the right, review the fees attached thereto with a view to ensuring that those fees
continue to promote optimal use, taking account, inter alia, of market developments and technological evolution.
For reasons of legal certainty, it is appropriate for any adjustments to the existing fees to be based on the same
principles as those applicable to the award of new rights of use.

(131) Effective management of radio spectrum can be ensured by facilitating the continued efficient use of radio spectrum

that has already been assigned. In order to ensure legal certainty to holders of the rights, the possibility of renewal of
rights of use should be considered within an appropriate time-span prior to the expiry of the rights concerned, for
example, where rights have been assigned for 15 years or more, at least two years before expiry of those rights,
unless the possibility of renewal was explicitly excluded at the time of assignment of the rights. In the interest of
continuous resource management, competent authorities should be able to undertake such consideration at their
own initiative as well as in response to a request from the assignee. The renewal of the right to use should not be
granted contrary to the will of the assignee.

(132) Transfer of rights of use for radio spectrum can be an effective means of increasing the efficient use of spectrum. For

the sake of flexibility and efficiency, and to allow valuation of radio spectrum by the market, Member States should
by default allow radio spectrum users to transfer or lease their rights of use for radio spectrum to third parties
following a simple procedure and subject to the conditions attached to such rights and to competition rules, under
the supervision of the national regulatory authorities responsible. In order to facilitate such transfers or leases,
provided that technical implementing measures adopted under Decision No 676/2002/EC are respected,
Member States should also consider requests to have radio spectrum rights partitioned or disaggregated and
conditions for use reviewed.

(133) Measures taken specifically to promote competition when granting or renewing rights of use for radio spectrum

should be decided by national regulatory and other competent authorities, which have the necessary economic,
technical and market knowledge. Radio spectrum assignment conditions can influence the competitive situation in
electronic communications markets and conditions for entry. Limited access to radio spectrum, in particular when
radio spectrum is scarce, can create a barrier to entry or hamper investment, network roll-out, the provision of new
services or applications, innovation and competition. New rights of use, including those acquired through transfer or
leasing, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for radio spectrum use can also influence existing competition.
Where unduly applied, certain conditions used to promote competition, can have other effects; for example, radio
spectrum caps and reservations can create artificial scarcity, wholesale access obligations can unduly constrain
business models in the absence of market power, and limits on transfers can impede the development of secondary
markets. Therefore, a consistent and objective competition test for the imposition of such conditions is necessary
and should be applied consistently. The use of such measures should therefore be based on a thorough and objective
assessment, by national regulatory and other competent authorities, of the market and the competitive conditions
thereof. National competent authorities should, however, always ensure the effective and efficient use of radio
spectrum and avoid distortion of competition through anti-competitive hoarding.

(134) Building on opinions from the RSPG, the adoption of a common deadline for allowing the use of a radio spectrum

band which has been harmonised under Decision No 676/2002/EC can be necessary to avoid cross-border
interference and beneficial to ensure release of the full benefits of the related technical harmonisation measures for
equipment markets and for the deployment of very high capacity networks and services. Allowing the use of a radio
spectrum band entails assigning radio spectrum under a general authorisation regime or individual rights of use in
order to permit the use of radio spectrum as soon as the assignment process is completed. In order to assign radio
spectrum bands, it might be necessary to release a band occupied by other users and to compensate them.
Implementation of a common deadline for allowing the use of harmonised bands for electronic communications
services, including for 5G, might however be affected in a particular Member State by problems relating to
unresolved cross-border coordination issues between Member States or with third countries, to the complexity of
ensuring the technical migration of existing users of a band; a restriction to the use of the band based on a general
interest objective, to the safeguarding of national security and defence or to force majeure. In any case,
Member States should take all measures to reduce any delay to the minimum in terms of geographical coverage,
timing and radio spectrum range. Moreover, Member States should be able, where appropriate in light of their

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/61

assessment of the relevant circumstances, to request the Union to provide legal, political and technical support to
resolve radio spectrum coordination issues with countries neighbouring the Union, including candidate and
acceding countries, in such a way that the Member States concerned can observe their obligations under Union law.

(135) In order to ensure increased coordinated availabilities of radio spectrum by 2020 to achieve very high speed fixed

and wireless networks in the context of 5G, the 3,4-3,8 GHz and the 24,25-27,5 GHz bands have been identified by
the RSPG as priority bands suitable to fulfil the objectives of the 5G Action Plan by 2020. The 40,5-43,5 GHz
and 66-71 GHz bands have also been identified for further study. It is therefore necessary to ensure that,
by 31 December 2020, the 3,4-3,8 GHz and the 24,25-27,5 GHz bands or parts thereof are available for terrestrial
systems capable of providing wireless broadband services under harmonised conditions established by technical
implementing measures adopted in accordance with Article 4 of Decision No 676/2002/EC, complementing
Decision (EU) 2017/899 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), as those bands have specific qualities, in
terms of coverage and data capacity, which allow them to be combined appropriately to meet 5G requirements.
Member States could, however, be affected by interference likely to arise from third countries which, in accordance
with the ITU Radio Regulations, have identified those bands for services other than international mobile
telecommunications. This might have an effect on the obligation to meet a common implementation date. Future use
of the 26 GHz band for 5G terrestrial wireless services is likely, inter alia, to target urban areas and sub-urban
hotspot areas, while some deployment can be foreseen along major roads and railway tracks in rural areas. This
provides the opportunity to use the 26 GHz band for services other than 5G wireless outside those geographic areas,
for example, for business specific communications or indoor use, and therefore allows Member States to designate
and make that band available on a non-exclusive basis.

(136) Where demand for a radio spectrum band exceeds the availability and, as a result, a Member State concludes that the

rights of use for radio spectrum is to be limited, appropriate and transparent procedures should apply for the
granting of such rights to avoid any discrimination and optimise the use of the scarce resource. Such limitation
should be justified, proportionate and based on a thorough assessment of market conditions, giving due weight to
the overall benefits for users and to national and internal market objectives. The objectives governing any limitation
procedure should be clearly established in advance. When considering the most appropriate selection procedure, and
in accordance with coordination measures taken at Union level, Member States should, in a timely and transparent
manner, consult all interested parties on the justification, objectives and conditions of the procedure. Member States
should be able to use, inter alia, competitive or comparative selection procedures for the assignment of radio
spectrum or of numbering resources with exceptional economic value. In administering such schemes, competent
authorities should take into account the objectives of this Directive. If a Member State finds that further rights can be
made available in a band, it should start the process therefor.

(137) Massive growth in radio spectrum demand, and in end-user demand for wireless broadband capacity, calls for

solutions allowing alternative, complementary, spectrally efficient access solutions, including low-power wireless
access systems with a small-area operating range, such as RLANs and networks of low-power small-size cellular
access points. Such complementary wireless access systems, in particular publicly accessible RLAN access points,
increase access to the internet for end-users and mobile traffic off-loading for mobile operators. RLANs use
harmonised radio spectrum without requiring an individual authorisation or a right of use for radio spectrum. To
date, most RLAN access points are used by private users as local wireless extension of their fixed broadband
connection. End-users, within the limits of their own internet subscription, should not be prevented from sharing
access to their RLAN with others, in order to increase the number of available access points, in particular, in densely
populated areas, maximise wireless data capacity through radio spectrum re-use and create a cost-effective
complementary wireless broadband infrastructure accessible to other end-users. Therefore, unnecessary restrictions
to the deployment and interlinkage of RLAN access points should also be removed.

(1)

Decision (EU) 2017/899 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 on the use of the 470-790 MHz frequency
band in the Union (OJ L 138, 25.5.2017, p. 131).

L 321/62

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(138) Public authorities or public service providers that use RLANs in their premises for their personnel, visitors or clients,

for example to facilitate access to e-Government services or for information on public transport or road traffic
management, could also provide access to such access points for general use by citizens as an ancillary service to
services they offer to the public on such premises, to the extent allowed by competition and public procurement
rules. Moreover, the provider of such local access to electronic communications networks within or around a private
property or a limited public area on a non-commercial basis or as an ancillary service to another activity that is not
dependent on such access, such as RLAN hotspots made available to customers of other commercial activities or to
the general public in that area, can be subject to compliance with general authorisations for rights of use for radio
spectrum but should not be subject to any conditions or requirements attached to general authorisations applicable
to providers of public electronic communications networks or services or to obligations regarding end-users or
interconnection. However, such a provider should remain subject to the liability rules set out in Directive 2000/31/
EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Further technologies, such as LiFi, are emerging and will
complement current radio spectrum capabilities of RLANs and wireless access point to include optical visible lightbased access points and lead to hybrid local area networks allowing optical wireless communication.

(139) Since low power small-area wireless access points, such as femtocells, picocells, metrocells or microcells, can be very

small and make use of unobtrusive equipment similar to that of domestic RLAN routers, which do not require any
permits beyond those necessary for the use of radio spectrum, and considering the positive impact of such access
points on the use of radio spectrum and on the development of wireless communications, any restriction to their
deployment should be limited to the greatest extent possible. As a result, in order to facilitate the deployment of
small-area wireless access points, and without prejudice to any applicable requirement related to radio spectrum
management, Member States should not subject to any individual permits the deployment of such devices on
buildings which are not officially protected as part of a designated environment or because of their special
architectural or historical merit, except for reasons of public safety. To that end, their characteristics, such as
maximum size, weight and emission characteristics, should be specified at Union level in a proportionate way for
local deployment and to ensure a high level of protection of public health, as laid down in Recommendation 1999/
519/EC. For the operation of small-area wireless access points, Article 7 of Directive 2014/53/EU should apply. This
is without prejudice to private property rights set out in Union or national law. The procedure for considering
permit applications should be streamlined and without prejudice to any commercial agreements and any
administrative charge involved should be limited to the administrative costs relating to the processing of the
application. The process of assessing a request for a permit should take as little time as possible, and in principle no
longer than four months.

(140) Public buildings and other public infrastructure are visited and used daily by a significant number of end-users who

need connectivity to consume eGovernment, eTransport and other services. Other public infrastructure, such as
street lamps, traffic lights, offer very valuable sites for deploying small cells, for instance, due to their density.
Without prejudice to the possibility for competent authorities to subject the deployment of small-area wireless access
points to individual prior permits, operators should have the right to access to those public sites for the purpose of
adequately serving demand. Member States should therefore ensure that such public buildings and other public
infrastructure are made available on reasonable conditions for the deployment of small-cells with a view to
complementing Directive 2014/61/EU and without prejudice to the principles set out in this Directive.
Directive 2014/61/EU follows a functional approach and imposes obligations of access to physical infrastructure
only when it is part of a network and only if it is owned or used by a network operator, thereby leaving many
buildings owned or used by public authorities outside its scope. On the contrary, a specific obligation is not
necessary for physical infrastructure, such as ducts or poles, used for intelligent transport systems, which are owned
by network operators (providers of transport services or providers of public electronic communications networks),
and host parts of a network, thus falling within the scope of Directive 2014/61/EU.

(141) The provisions of this Directive as regards access and interconnection apply to public electronic communications

networks. Providers of electronic communications networks other than to the public do not have access or
interconnection obligations under this Directive except where, in benefiting from access to public networks, they
may be subject to conditions laid down by Member States.

(1)

Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society
services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on electronic commerce) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1).

17.12.2018

L 321/63

(142) The term ‘access’ has a wide range of meanings, and it is therefore necessary to define precisely how that term is used

in this Directive, without prejudice to how it is used in other Union measures. An operator may own the underlying
network or facilities or may rent some or all of them.

(143) In an open and competitive market, there should be no restrictions that prevent undertakings from negotiating

access and interconnection arrangements between themselves, in particular on cross-border agreements, subject to
the competition rules laid down in the TFEU. In the context of achieving a more efficient, truly pan-European
market, with effective competition, more choice and competitive services to end-users, undertakings which receive
requests for access or interconnection from other undertakings that are subject to general authorisation in order to
provide electronic communications networks or services to the public should in principle conclude such agreements
on a commercial basis, and negotiate in good faith.

(144) In markets where there continue to be large differences in negotiating power between undertakings, and where some

undertakings rely on infrastructure provided by others for delivery of their services, it is appropriate to establish a
regulatory framework to ensure that the market functions effectively. National regulatory authorities should have the
power to secure, where commercial negotiation fails, adequate access and interconnection and interoperability of
services in the interest of end-users. In particular, they can ensure end-to-end connectivity by imposing
proportionate obligations on undertakings that are subject to the general authorisation and that control access to
end-users. Control of means of access may entail ownership or control of the physical link to the end-user (either
fixed or mobile), or the ability to change or withdraw the national number or numbers needed to access an enduser’s network termination point. This would be the case for example if network operators were to restrict
unreasonably end-user choice for access to internet portals and services.

(145) In light of the principle of non-discrimination, national regulatory authorities should ensure that all undertakings,

irrespective of their size and business model, whether vertically integrated or separated, can interconnect on
reasonable terms and conditions, with a view to providing end-to-end connectivity and access to the internet.

(146) National legal or administrative measures that link the terms and conditions for access or interconnection to the

activities of the party seeking interconnection, and specifically to the degree of its investment in network
infrastructure, and not to the interconnection or access services provided, may cause market distortion and may
therefore not be compatible with competition rules.

(147) Network operators who control access to their own customers do so on the basis of unique numbers or addresses

from a published numbering or addressing range. Other network operators need to be able to deliver traffic to those
customers, and so need to be able to interconnect directly or indirectly to each other. It is therefore appropriate to lay
down rights and obligations to negotiate interconnection.

(148) Interoperability is of benefit to end-users and is an important aim of that regulatory framework. Encouraging

interoperability is one of the objectives for national regulatory and other competent authorities as set out in that
framework. That framework also provides for the Commission to publish a list of standards or specifications
covering the provision of services, technical interfaces or network functions, as the basis for encouraging
harmonisation in electronic communications. Member States should encourage the use of published standards or
specifications to the extent strictly necessary to ensure interoperability of services and to improve freedom of choice
for users.

(149) Currently both end-to-end connectivity and access to emergency services depend on end-users using number-based

interpersonal communications services. Future technological developments or an increased use of numberindependent interpersonal communications services could entail a lack of sufficient interoperability between
communications services. As a consequence, significant barriers to market entry and obstacles to further onward
innovation could emerge and appreciably threaten effective end-to-end connectivity between end-users.

L 321/64

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(150) Where such interoperability issues arise, the Commission should be able to request a BEREC report which should

provide a factual assessment of the market situation at Union and Member State level. Taking utmost account of the
BEREC report and other available evidence and taking into account the effects on the internal market, the
Commission should decide whether there is a need for regulatory intervention by national regulatory or other
competent authorities. If the Commission considers that such regulatory intervention should be considered by
national regulatory or other competent authorities, it should be able to adopt implementing measures specifying the
nature and scope of possible regulatory interventions by national regulatory or other competent authorities,
including in particular obligations to publish and allow the use, modification and redistribution of relevant
information by the authorities and other providers and measures to impose the mandatory use of standards or
specifications on all or specific providers.

(151) National regulatory or other competent authorities should assess, in light of the specific national circumstances,

whether any intervention is necessary and justified to ensure end-to-end-connectivity, and if so, impose
proportionate obligations, in accordance with the Commission’s implementing measures, on those providers of
number-independent interpersonal communications services with a significant level of coverage and user-uptake.
The term significant should be interpreted in the sense that the geographic coverage and the number of end-users of
the provider concerned represent a critical mass with a view to achieving the goal of ensuring end-to-end
connectivity between end-users. Providers with a limited number of end-users or limited geographic coverage which
would contribute only marginally to achieving that goal, should normally not be subject to such interoperability
obligations.

(152) In situations where undertakings are deprived of access to viable alternatives to non-replicable wiring, cables and

associated facilities inside buildings or up to the first concentration or distribution point and in order to promote
competitive outcomes in the interest of end-users, national regulatory authorities should be empowered to impose
access obligations on all undertakings, irrespective of a designation as having significant market power. In that
regard, national regulatory authorities should take into consideration all technical and economic barriers to future
replication of networks. However, as such obligations can in certain cases be intrusive, can undermine incentives for
investments, and can have the effect of strengthening the position of dominant players, they should be imposed only
where justified and proportionate to achieving sustainable competition in the relevant markets. The mere fact that
more than one such infrastructure already exists should not necessarily be interpreted as showing that its assets are
replicable. If necessary in combination with such access obligations, undertakings should also be able to rely on the
obligations to provide access to physical infrastructure on the basis of Directive 2014/61/EU. Any obligations
imposed by the national regulatory authority under this Directive and decisions taken by other competent
authorities under Directive 2014/61/EU to ensure access to in-building physical infrastructure or to physical
infrastructure up to the access point should be consistent.

(153) National regulatory authorities should be able, to the extent necessary, to impose obligations on undertakings to

provide access to the facilities referred to in an annex to this Directive, namely application programming interfaces
(APIs) and electronic programme guides (EPGs), to ensure not only accessibility for end-users to digital radio and
television broadcast services but also to related complementary services. Such complementary services should be
able to include programme related services which are specifically designed to improve accessibility for end-users
with disabilities, and programme related connected television services.

(154) It is important that when national regulatory authorities assess the concentration or distribution point up to which

they intend to impose access, they choose a point in accordance with BEREC guidelines. Selecting a point nearer to
end-users will be more beneficial to infrastructure competition and the roll-out of very high capacity networks. In
this way the national regulatory authority should first consider choosing a point in a building or just outside a
building. It could be justified to extend access obligations to wiring and cables beyond the first concentration or
distribution point while confining such obligations to points as close as possible to end-users capable of hosting a
sufficient number of end-users, where it is demonstrated that replication faces high and non-transitory physical or
economic barriers, leading to important competition problems or market failures at the retail level to the detriment
of end-users. The assessment of the replicability of network elements requires a market review which is different
from an analysis assessing significant market power, and so the national regulatory authority does not need to

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/65

establish significant market power in order to impose these obligations. On the other hand, such review requires a
sufficient economic assessment of market conditions, to establish whether the criteria necessary to impose
obligations beyond the first concentration or distribution point are met. Such extended access obligations are more
likely to be necessary in geographical areas where the business case for alternative infrastructure rollout is more
risky, for example because of low population density or because of the limited number of multi-dwelling buildings.
Conversely, a high concentration of households might indicate that the imposition of such obligations is
unnecessary. National regulatory authorities should also consider whether such obligations have the potential to
strengthen the position of undertakings designated as having significant market power. National regulatory
authorities should be able to impose access to active or virtual network elements used for service provision on such
infrastructure if access to passive elements would be economically inefficient or physically impracticable, and if the
national regulatory authority considers that, absent such an intervention, the purpose of the access obligation would
be circumvented. In order to enhance consistent regulatory practice across the Union, the Commission should be
able to require the national regulatory authority to withdraw its draft measures extending access obligations beyond
the first concentration or distribution point, where BEREC shares the Commission’s serious doubts as to the
compatibility of the draft measure with Union law and in particular the regulatory objectives of this Directive.

(155) In such cases, in order to comply with the principle of proportionality, it can be appropriate for national regulatory

authorities to exempt certain categories of owners or undertakings, or both, from obligations going beyond the first
concentration or distribution point, which should be determined by national regulatory authorities, on the grounds
that an access obligation not based on an undertaking’s designation as having significant market power would risk
compromising their business case for recently deployed network elements, in particular by small local projects.
Wholesale-only undertakings should not be subject to such access obligations if they offer an effective alternative
access on a commercial basis to a very high capacity network, on fair, non-discriminatory and reasonable terms and
conditions, including as regards price. It should be possible to extend that exemption to other providers on the same
terms. The exemption may not be appropriate for providers that are in receipt of public funding.

(156) Sharing of passive infrastructure used in the provision of wireless electronic communications services in compliance

with competition law principles can be particularly useful to maximise very high capacity connectivity throughout
the Union, especially in less dense areas where replication is impracticable and end-users risk being deprived of such
connectivity. National regulatory or other competent authorities should, by way of exception, be able to impose such
sharing or localised roaming access, in accordance with Union law, if that possibility has been clearly established in
the original conditions for the granting of the right of use and they demonstrate the benefits of such sharing in terms
of overcoming insurmountable economic or physical obstacles and access to networks or services is therefore
severely deficient or absent, and taking into account several factors, including in particular the need for coverage
along major transport paths, choice and a higher quality of service for end-users as well as the need to maintain
infrastructure roll-out incentives. In circumstances where there is no access by end-users, and sharing of passive
infrastructure alone does not suffice to address the situation, the national regulatory authorities should be able to
impose obligations on the sharing of active infrastructure. In so doing, national regulatory or other competent
authorities retain the flexibility to choose the most appropriate sharing or access obligation which should be
proportionate and justified based on the nature of the problem identified.

(157) While it is appropriate in some circumstances for a national regulatory or other competent authority to impose

obligations on undertakings irrespective of a designation of significant market power in order to achieve goals such
as end-to-end connectivity or interoperability of services, it is necessary to ensure that such obligations are imposed
in accordance with the regulatory framework and, in particular, its notification procedures. Such obligations should
be imposed only where justified in order to secure the objectives of this Directive, and where they are objectively
justified, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory for the purpose of promoting efficiency, sustainable
competition, efficient investment and innovation, and giving the maximum benefit to end-users, and imposed in
accordance with the relevant notification procedures.

(158) In order to overcome insurmountable economic or physical obstacles for providing end-users with services or

networks which rely on the use of radio spectrum and where mobile coverage gaps persist, their closing may require
the access and sharing of passive infrastructure, or, where this is not sufficient, the sharing of active infrastructure, or

L 321/66

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

localised roaming access agreements. Without prejudice to sharing obligations attached to the rights of use on the
basis of other provisions of this Directive, and in particular measures to promote competition, where national
regulatory or other competent authorities intend to take measures to impose the sharing of passive infrastructure, or
when passive access and sharing are not sufficient, active infrastructure sharing or localised roaming access
agreements, they may, however, also be called to consider the possible risk for market participants in underserved
areas.

(159) Competition rules alone may not always be sufficient to ensure cultural diversity and media pluralism in the area of

digital television. Technological and market developments make it necessary to review obligations to provide
conditional access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms on a regular basis, by a Member State for its
national market, in particular to determine whether it is justified to extend obligations to EPGs and APIs, to the
extent necessary to ensure accessibility for end-users to specified digital broadcasting services. Member States should
be able to specify the digital broadcasting services to which access by end-users is to be ensured by any legislative,
regulatory or administrative means that they consider to be necessary.

(160) Member States should also be able to permit their national regulatory authority to review obligations in relation to

conditional access to digital broadcasting services in order to assess through a market analysis whether to withdraw
or amend conditions for undertakings that do not have significant market power on the relevant market. Such a
withdrawal or amendment should not adversely affect access for end-users to such services or the prospects for
effective competition.

(161) There is a need for ex ante obligations in certain circumstances in order to ensure the development of a competitive

market, the conditions of which favour the deployment and take-up of very high capacity networks and services, and
the maximisation of end-user benefits. The definition of significant market power used in this Directive is equivalent
to the concept of dominance as defined in the case-law of the Court of Justice.

(162) Two or more undertakings can be found to enjoy a joint dominant position not only where there exist structural or

other links between them but also where the structure of the relevant market is conducive to coordinated effects,
that is, it encourages parallel or aligned anti-competitive behaviour on the market.

(163) It is essential that ex ante regulatory obligations should be imposed on a wholesale market only where there are one

or more undertakings with significant market power, with a view to ensuring sustainable competition and where
Union and national competition law remedies are not sufficient to address the problem. The Commission has drawn
up guidelines at Union level in accordance with the principles of competition law for national regulatory authorities
to follow in assessing whether competition is effective in a given market and in assessing significant market power.
National regulatory authorities should analyse whether a given product or service market is effectively competitive in
a given geographical area, which could be the whole or a part of the territory of the Member State concerned or
neighbouring parts of territories of Member States considered together. An analysis of effective competition should
include an analysis as to whether the market is prospectively competitive, and thus whether any lack of effective
competition is durable. Those guidelines should also address the issue of newly emerging markets, where de facto the
market leader is likely to have a substantial market share but should not be subjected to inappropriate obligations.
The Commission should review the guidelines regularly, in particular on the occasion of a review of the existing law,
taking into account the case-law of the Court of Justice, economic thinking and actual market experience and with a
view to ensuring that they remain appropriate in a rapidly developing market. National regulatory authorities will
need to cooperate with each other where the relevant market is found to be transnational.

(164) In determining whether an undertaking has significant market power in a specific market, national regulatory

authorities should act in accordance with Union law and take utmost account of the Commission guidelines on
market analysis and the assessment of significant market power.

17.12.2018

L 321/67

(165) National regulatory authorities should define relevant geographic markets within their territory taking into utmost

account the Commission Recommendation on relevant product and service markets (the ‘Recommendation’)
adopted pursuant to this Directive and taking into account national and local circumstances. Therefore, national
regulatory authorities should at least analyse the markets that are contained in the Recommendation, including those
markets that are listed but no longer regulated in the specific national or local context. National regulatory
authorities should also analyse markets that are not contained in that Recommendation, but that are regulated
within the territory of their jurisdiction on the basis of previous market analyses, or other markets, if they have
sufficient grounds to consider that the three criteria provided in this Directive are met.

(166) Transnational markets can be defined when it is justified by the geographic market definition, taking into account all

supply-side and demand-side factors in accordance with competition law principles. BEREC is the most appropriate
body to undertake such analysis, benefiting from the extensive collective experience of national regulatory
authorities when defining markets on a national level. National circumstances should be taken into account when an
analysis of potential transnational markets is undertaken. If transnational markets are defined and warrant regulatory
intervention, concerned national regulatory authorities should cooperate to identify the appropriate regulatory
response, including in the process of notification to the Commission. They can also cooperate in the same manner
where transnational markets are not identified but on their territories market conditions are sufficiently
homogeneous to benefit from a coordinated regulatory approach, such as for example in terms of similar costs,
market structures or operators, or in the case of transnational or comparable end-user demand.

(167) In some circumstances geographic markets are defined as national or sub-national, for example due to the national

or local nature of network roll-out which determines the boundaries of undertakings’ potential market power in
respect of wholesale supply, but there is still a significant transnational demand from one or more categories of endusers. That can in particular be the case for demand from business end-users with multisite facility operations in
different Member States. If that transnational demand is not sufficiently met by suppliers, for example if they are
fragmented along national borders or locally, a potential internal market barrier arises. Therefore, BEREC should be
empowered to provide guidelines to national regulatory authorities on common regulatory approaches to ensure
that transnational demand can be met in a satisfactory way, providing a basis for the interoperability of wholesale
access products across the Union and permitting efficiencies and economies of scale despite the fragmented supply
side. BEREC’s guidelines should shape the choices of national regulatory authorities in pursuing the internal market
objective when imposing regulatory obligations on undertakings designated as having significant market power at
national level while providing guidance for the harmonisation of technical specifications of wholesale access
products capable of meeting such identified transnational demand, in the interest of the internal market.

(168) The objective of any ex ante regulatory intervention is ultimately to produce benefits for end-users in terms of price,

quality and choice by making retail markets effectively competitive on a sustainable basis. It is likely that national
regulatory authorities will gradually be able to find many retail markets to be competitive even in the absence of
wholesale regulation, especially taking into account expected improvements in innovation and competition.

(169) For national regulatory authorities, the starting point for the identification of wholesale markets susceptible to ex

ante regulation is the analysis of corresponding retail markets. The analysis of effective competition at the retail and
at the wholesale level is conducted from a forward-looking perspective over a given time horizon, and is guided by
competition law, including, as appropriate, the relevant case law of the Court of Justice. If it is concluded that a retail
market would be effectively competitive in the absence of ex ante wholesale regulation on the corresponding
relevant markets, this should lead the national regulatory authority to conclude that regulation is no longer needed
at the relevant wholesale level.

(170) During the gradual transition to deregulated markets, commercial agreements, including for co-investment and

access between operators will gradually become more common, and if they are sustainable and improve competitive
dynamics, they can contribute to the conclusion that a particular wholesale market does not warrant ex ante
regulation. A similar logic would apply in reverse, to the unforeseeable termination of commercial agreements on a

L 321/68

EN

17.12.2018

deregulated market. The analysis of such agreements should take into account that the prospect of regulation can be
a motive for network owners to enter into commercial negotiations. With a view to ensuring adequate consideration
of the impact of regulation imposed on related markets when determining whether a given market warrants ex ante
regulation, national regulatory authorities should ensure markets are analysed in a consistent manner and where
possible, at the same time or as close as possible to each other in time.

(171) When assessing wholesale regulation to solve problems at the retail level, national regulatory authorities should take

into account the fact that several wholesale markets can provide wholesale upstream inputs for a particular retail
market, and, conversely, that a single wholesale market can provide wholesale upstream inputs for a variety of retail
markets. Furthermore, competitive dynamics in a particular market can be influenced by markets that are
contiguous but not in a vertical relationship, such as can be the case between certain fixed and mobile markets.
National regulatory authorities should conduct that assessment for each individual wholesale market considered for
regulation, starting with remedies for access to civil infrastructure, as such remedies are usually conducive to more
sustainable competition including infrastructure competition, and thereafter analysing any wholesale markets
considered susceptible to ex ante regulation in order of their likely suitability to address identified competition
problems at retail level. When deciding on the specific remedy to be imposed, national regulatory authorities should
assess its technical feasibility and carry out a cost-benefit analysis, having regard to its degree of suitability to address
the identified competition problems at retail level, and enabling competition based on differentiation and technology
neutrality. National regulatory authorities should consider the consequences of imposing any specific remedy which,
if feasible only on certain network topologies, could constitute a disincentive for the deployment of very high
capacity networks in the interest of end-users.

(172) Without prejudice to the principle of technology neutrality, the national regulatory authorities should provide

incentives through the remedies imposed, and, where possible, before the roll-out of infrastructure, for the
development of flexible and open network architecture, which would reduce eventually the burden and complexity
of remedies imposed at a later stage. At each stage of the assessment, before the national regulatory authority
determines whether any additional, more burdensome, remedy should be imposed on the undertaking designated as
having significant market power, it should seek to determine whether the retail market concerned would be
effectively competitive, also taking into account any relevant commercial arrangements or other wholesale market
circumstances, including other types of regulation already in force, such as for example general access obligations to
non-replicable assets or obligations imposed pursuant to Directive 2014/61/EU, and of any regulation already
considered to be appropriate by the national regulatory authority for an undertaking designated as having significant
market power. Such an assessment, aiming to ensure that only the most appropriate remedies necessary to
effectively address any problems identified in the market analysis are imposed, does not preclude a national
regulatory authority from finding that a mix of such remedies together, even if of differing intensity, in line with the
proportionality principle, offers the least intrusive way of addressing the problem. Even if such differences do not
result in the definition of distinct geographic markets, they should be able to justify differentiation in the appropriate
remedies imposed in light of the differing intensity of competitive constraints.

(173) Ex ante regulation imposed at the wholesale level, which is in principle less intrusive than retail regulation, is

considered to be sufficient to tackle potential competition problems on the related downstream retail market or
markets. The advances in the functioning of competition since the regulatory framework for electronic
communications has been in place are demonstrated by the progressive deregulation of retail markets across the
Union. Furthermore, the rules relating to the imposition of ex ante remedies on undertakings designated as having
significant market power should, where possible, be simplified and be made more predictable. Therefore, the
imposition of ex ante regulatory controls based on an undertaking’s designation as having significant market power
in wholesale markets should prevail.

(174) When a national regulatory authority withdraws wholesale regulation, it should define an appropriate notice period

to ensure a sustainable transition to a de-regulated market. In defining such a notice period, the national regulatory

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/69

authority should take into account the existing agreements between access providers and access seekers that have
been entered into on the basis of the imposed regulatory obligations. In particular, such agreements can provide a
contractual legal protection to access seekers for a determined period. The national regulatory authority should also
take into account the effective possibility for market participants to take up any commercial wholesale access or coinvestment offers which can be present in the market and the need to avoid an extended period of possible
regulatory arbitrage. Transition arrangements established by the national regulatory authority should consider the
extent and timing of regulatory oversight of pre-existing agreements, once the notice period starts.

(175) In order to provide market players with certainty as to regulatory conditions, a time limit for market reviews is

necessary. It is important to conduct a market analysis on a regular basis and within a reasonable and appropriate
time-frame. There is a risk that failure by a national regulatory authority to analyse a market within the time-limit
jeopardises the internal market, and normal infringement proceedings do not produce their desired effect on time.
Alternatively, the national regulatory authority concerned should be able to request the assistance of BEREC to
complete the market analysis. Such assistance could, for example, take the form of a specific task force composed of
representatives of other national regulatory authorities.

(176) Due to the high level of technological innovation and highly dynamic markets in the electronic communications

sector, there is a need to adapt regulation rapidly in a coordinated and harmonised way at Union level, as experience
has shown that divergence among the national regulatory authorities in the implementation of the regulatory
framework may create a barrier to the internal market.

(177) However, in the interest of greater stability and predictability of regulatory measures, the maximum period allowed

between market analyses should be extended from three to five years, provided market changes in the intervening
period do not require a new analysis. In determining whether a national regulatory authority has complied with its
obligation to analyse markets and notified the corresponding draft measure at a minimum every five years, only a
notification including a new assessment of the market definition and of significant market power will be considered
to be starting a new five-year market cycle. A mere notification of new or amended regulatory remedies, imposed on
the basis of a previous and unrevised market analysis will not be considered to have satisfied that obligation. Noncompliance by a national regulatory authority with the obligation to conduct market analysis at regular intervals laid
down in this Directive should not be considered, in itself, to be a ground for the invalidity or inapplicability of
existing obligations imposed by that national regulatory authority in the market in question.

(178) The imposition of a specific obligation on an undertaking designated as having significant market power does not

require an additional market analysis but rather a justification that the obligation in question is appropriate and
proportionate in relation to the nature of the problem identified on the market in question, and on the related retail
market.

(179) When assessing the proportionality of the obligations and conditions to be imposed, national regulatory authorities

should take into account the different competitive conditions existing in the different areas within their
Member States having regard in particular to the results of the geographical survey conducted in accordance with
this Directive.

(180) When considering whether to impose remedies to control prices, and if so in what form, national regulatory

authorities should seek to allow a fair return for the investor on a particular new investment project. In particular,
there are risks associated with investment projects specific to new access networks which support products for
which demand is uncertain at the time the investment is made.

(181) Reviews of obligations imposed on undertakings designated as having significant market power during the

timeframe of a market analysis should allow national regulatory authorities to take into account the impact on
competitive conditions of new developments, for instance of newly concluded voluntary agreements between
undertakings, such as access and co-investment agreements, thus providing the flexibility which is particularly
necessary in the context of longer regulatory cycles. A similar logic should apply in the case of an unforeseeable
breach or termination of a commercial agreement, or if such an agreement has effects diverging from the market

L 321/70

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

analysis. If the termination of an existing agreement occurs in a deregulated market, it is possible that a new market
analysis is required. In the absence of a single important change in the market but in the case of dynamic markets, it
may be necessary to conduct a market analysis more often than every five years, for example not earlier than every
three years as was the case until the date of application of this Directive. Markets should be considered to be dynamic
if the technological evolution and end-user demand patterns are likely to evolve in such a way that the conclusions
of the analysis would be superseded within the medium term for a significant group of geographic areas or of endusers within the geographic and product market defined by the national regulatory authority.

(182) Transparency of terms and conditions for access and interconnection, including prices, serve to speed up

negotiation, avoid disputes and give confidence to market players that a service is not being provided on
discriminatory terms. Openness and transparency of technical interfaces can be particularly important in ensuring
interoperability. Where a national regulatory authority imposes obligations to make information public, it should
also be able to specify the manner in which the information is to be made available, and whether it is free of charge,
taking into account the nature and purpose of the information concerned.

(183) In light of the variety of network topologies, access products and market circumstance that have arisen since 2002,

the objectives of Annex II to Directive 2002/19/EC, concerning local loop unbundling, and access products for
providers of digital television and radio services, can be better achieved and in a more flexible manner, by providing
guidelines on the minimum criteria for a reference offer to be developed by and periodically updated by BEREC. That
Annex should therefore be deleted.

(184) The principle of non-discrimination ensures that undertakings with significant market power do not distort

competition, in particular where they are vertically integrated undertakings that supply services to undertakings with
whom they compete on downstream markets.

(185) In order to address and prevent non-price related discriminatory behaviour, equivalence of inputs (EoI) is in principle

the surest way of achieving effective protection from discrimination. On the other hand, providing regulated
wholesale inputs on an EoI basis is likely to trigger higher compliance costs than other forms of non-discrimination
obligations. Those higher compliance costs should be measured against the benefits of more vigorous competition
downstream, and of the relevance of non-discrimination guarantees in circumstances where the undertaking
designated as having significant market power is not subject to direct price controls. In particular, national
regulatory authorities might consider that the provision of wholesale inputs over new systems on an EoI basis is
more likely to create sufficient net benefits, and thus be proportionate, given the comparatively lower incremental
compliance costs to ensure that newly built systems are EoI-compliant. On the other hand, national regulatory
authorities should also consider whether obligations are proportionate for affected undertakings, for example, by
taking into account implementation costs and weigh up possible disincentives to the deployment of new systems,
relative to more incremental upgrades, in the event that the former would be subject to more restrictive regulatory
obligations. In Member States with a high number of small-scale undertakings designated as having significant
market power, the imposition of EoI on each of those undertakings can be disproportionate.

(186) Accounting separation allows internal price transfers to be rendered visible, and allows national regulatory

authorities to check compliance with obligations for non-discrimination where applicable. In this regard the
Commission published Recommendation 2005/698/EC (1).

(187) Civil engineering assets that can host an electronic communications network are crucial for the successful roll-out of

new networks because of the high cost of duplicating them, and the significant savings that can be made when they
can be reused. Therefore, in addition to the rules on physical infrastructure laid down in Directive 2014/61/EU, a
specific remedy is necessary in those circumstances where civil engineering assets are owned by an undertaking
designated as having significant market power. Where civil engineering assets exist and are reusable, the positive

(1)

Commission Recommendation 2005/698/EC of 19 September 2005 on accounting separation and cost accounting systems under
the regulatory framework for electronic communications (OJ L 266, 11.10.2005, p. 64).

17.12.2018

L 321/71

effect of achieving effective access to them on the roll-out of competing infrastructure is very high, and it is therefore
necessary to ensure that access to such assets can be used as a self-standing remedy for the improvement of
competitive and deployment dynamics in any downstream market, to be considered before assessing the need to
impose any other potential remedies, and not just as an ancillary remedy to other wholesale products or services or
as a remedy limited to undertakings availing themselves of such other wholesale products or services. National
regulatory authorities should value reusable legacy civil engineering assets on the basis of the regulatory accounting
value net of the accumulated depreciation at the time of calculation, indexed by an appropriate price index, such as
the retail price index, and excluding those assets which are fully depreciated, over a period of not less than 40 years,
but still in use.

(188) National regulatory authorities should, when imposing obligations for access to new and enhanced infrastructures,

ensure that access conditions reflect the circumstances underlying the investment decision, taking into account, inter
alia, the roll-out costs, the expected rate of take up of the new products and services and the expected retail price
levels. Moreover, in order to provide planning certainty to investors, national regulatory authorities should be able to
set, if applicable, terms and conditions for access which are consistent over appropriate review periods. In the event
that price controls are considered to be appropriate, such terms and conditions can include pricing arrangements
which depend on volumes or length of contract in accordance with Union law and provided they have no
discriminatory effect. Any access conditions imposed should respect the need to preserve effective competition in
services to consumers and businesses.

(189) Mandating access to network infrastructure can be justified as a means of increasing competition, but national

regulatory authorities need to balance the rights of an infrastructure owner to exploit its infrastructure for its own
benefit, and the rights of other service providers to access facilities that are essential for the provision of competing
services.

(190) In markets where an increased number of access networks can be expected on a forward-looking basis, end-users are

more likely to benefit from improvements in network quality, by virtue of infrastructure-based competition,
compared to markets where only one network persists. The adequacy of competition on other parameters, such as
price and choice, is likely to depend on the national and local competitive circumstances. In assessing the adequacy
of competition on such parameters and the need for regulatory intervention, national regulatory authorities should
also take into account whether wholesale access is available to any interested undertaking on reasonable commercial
terms permitting sustainable competitive outcomes for end-users on the retail market. The application of general
competition rules in markets characterised by sustainable and effective infrastructure-based competition should be
sufficient.

(191) Where obligations are imposed on undertakings that require them to meet reasonable requests for access to and use

of networks elements and associated facilities, such requests should be refused only on the basis of objective criteria
such as technical feasibility or the need to maintain network integrity. Where access is refused, the aggrieved party
should be able to submit the case to the dispute resolutions procedures under this Directive. An undertaking with
mandated access obligations cannot be required to provide types of access which it is not within its power to
provide. The imposition by national regulatory authorities of mandated access that increases competition in the
short term should not reduce incentives for competitors to invest in alternative facilities that will secure more
sustainable competition or higher performance and end-user benefits in the long term. When choosing the least
intrusive regulatory intervention, and in line with the principle of proportionality, national regulatory authorities
could, for example, decide to review the obligations imposed on undertakings designated as having significant
market power and amend any previous decision, including by withdrawing obligations, imposing or not imposing
new access obligations if this is in the interests of users and sustainable service competition. National regulatory
authorities should be able to impose technical and operational conditions on the provider or beneficiaries of
mandated access in accordance with Union law. In particular the imposition of technical standards should comply
with Directive (EU) 2015/1535.

(192) Price control may be necessary when market analysis in a particular market reveals inefficient competition. In

particular, undertakings designated as having significant market power should avoid a price squeeze whereby the

L 321/72

EN

difference between their retail prices and the interconnection or access prices charged to competitors who provide
similar retail services is not adequate to ensure sustainable competition. When a national regulatory authority
calculates costs incurred in establishing a service mandated under this Directive, it is appropriate to allow a
reasonable return on the capital employed including appropriate labour and building costs, with the value of capital
adjusted where necessary to reflect the current valuation of assets and efficiency of operations. The method of cost
recovery should be appropriate to the circumstances taking account of the need to promote efficiency, sustainable
competition and deployment of very high capacity networks and thereby maximise end-user benefits, and should
take in account the need to have predictable and stable wholesale prices for the benefit of all operators seeking to
deploy new and enhanced networks, in accordance with Commission Recommendation 2013/466/EU (1).

(193) Due to uncertainty regarding the rate of materialisation of demand for the provision of next-generation broadband

services, it is important in order to promote efficient investment and innovation to allow those operators investing
in new or upgraded networks a certain degree of pricing flexibility. National regulatory authorities should be able to
decide to maintain or not to impose regulated wholesale access prices on next-generation networks if sufficient
competition safeguards are present. More specifically, to prevent excessive prices in markets where there are
undertakings designated as having significant market power, pricing flexibility should be accompanied by additional
safeguards to protect competition and end-user interests, such as strict non-discrimination obligations, measures to
ensure technical and economic replicability of downstream products, and a demonstrable retail price constraint
resulting from infrastructure competition or a price anchor stemming from other regulated access products, or both.
Those competitive safeguards do not prejudice the identification by national regulatory authorities of other
circumstances under which it would be appropriate not to impose regulated access prices for certain wholesale
inputs, such as where high price elasticity of end-user demand makes it unprofitable for the undertaking designated
as having significant market power to charge prices appreciably above the competitive level or where lower
population density reduces the incentives for the development of very high capacity networks and the national
regulatory authority establishes that effective and non-discriminatory access is ensured through obligations imposed
in accordance with this Directive.

(194) Where a national regulatory authority imposes obligations to implement a cost-accounting system in order to

support price controls, it should be able to undertake an annual audit to ensure compliance with that costaccounting system, provided that it has the necessary qualified staff, or to require such an audit to be carried out by
another qualified body, independent of the undertaking concerned.

(195) The charging system in the Union for wholesale voice call termination is based on Calling Party Network Pays. An

analysis of demand and supply substitutability shows that currently or in the foreseeable future, there are no
substitutes at wholesale level which might constrain the setting of charges for termination in a given network. Taking
into account the two-way access nature of termination markets, further potential competition problems include
cross-subsidisation between operators. Those potential competition problems are common to both fixed and mobile
voice call termination markets. Therefore, in light of the ability and incentives of terminating operators to raise
prices substantially above cost, cost orientation is considered to be the most appropriate intervention to address this
concern over the medium term. Future market developments may alter the dynamics of those markets to the extent
that regulation would no longer be necessary.

(196) In order to reduce the regulatory burden in addressing the competition problems relating to wholesale voice call

termination consistently across the Union, the Commission should establish, by means of a delegated act, a single
maximum voice termination rate for mobile services and a single maximum voice termination rate for fixed services
that apply Union-wide.

(1)

Commission Recommendation 2013/466/EU of 11 September 2013 on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing
methodologies to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment environment (OJ L 251, 21.9.2013, p. 13).

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/73

(197) This Directive should lay down the detailed criteria and parameters on the basis of which the values of voice call

termination rates are set. Termination rates across the Union have decreased consistently and are expected to
continue to do so. When the Commission determines the maximum termination rates in the first delegated act that it
adopts pursuant to this Directive, it should disregard any unjustified exceptional national deviation from that trend.

(198) Due to current uncertainty regarding the rate of materialisation of demand for very high capacity broadband services

as well as general economies of scale and density, co-investment agreements offer significant benefits in terms of
pooling of costs and risks, enabling smaller-scale undertakings to invest on economically rational terms and thus
promoting sustainable, long-term competition, including in areas where infrastructure-based competition might not
be efficient. Such co-investments can take different forms, including co-ownership of network assets or long-term
risk sharing through co-financing or through purchase agreements. In that context, purchase agreements which
constitute co-investments entail the acquisition of specific rights to capacity of a structural character, involving a
degree of co-determination and enabling co-investors to compete effectively and sustainably in the long term in
downstream markets in which the undertaking designated as having significant market power is active. By contrast,
commercial access agreements that are limited to the rental of capacity do not give rise to such rights and therefore
should not be considered to be co-investments.

(199) Where an undertaking designated as having significant market power makes an offer for co-investment on fair,

reasonable and non-discriminatory terms in very high capacity networks that consist of optical fibre elements up to
the end-user premises or the base station, providing an opportunity to undertakings of different sizes and financial
capacity to become infrastructure co-investors, the national regulatory authority should be able to refrain from
imposing obligations pursuant to this Directive on the new very high capacity network if at least one potential coinvestor has entered into a co-investment agreement with that undertaking. Where a national regulatory authority
decides to make binding a co-investment offer that has not resulted in an agreement, and decides, not to impose
additional regulatory obligations, it can do so, subject to the condition that such an agreement is to be concluded
before the deregulatory measure takes effect. Where it is technically impracticable to deploy optical fibre elements up
to the end-user’s premises, very high capacity networks consisting of optical fibre elements up to the immediate
proximity of, meaning just outside, such premises should also be able to benefit from the same regulatory treatment.

(200) When making a determination to refrain from imposing obligations, the national regulatory authority should take

such steps after ensuring that the co-investment offers comply with the necessary criteria and are made in good faith.
The differential regulatory treatment of new very high capacity networks should be subject to review in subsequent
market analyses which, in particular after some time has elapsed, may require adjustments to the regulatory
treatment. In duly justified circumstances, national regulatory authorities should be able to impose obligations on
such new network elements when they establish that certain markets would, in the absence of regulatory
intervention, face significant competition problems. In particular, when there are multiple downstream markets that
have not reached the same degree of competition, national regulatory authorities could require specific asymmetric
remedies to promote effective competition, for instance, but not limited to, niche retail markets, such as electronic
communications products for business end-users. To maintain the competitiveness of the markets, national
regulatory authorities should also safeguard the rights of access seekers who do not participate in a given coinvestment. This should be achieved through the maintenance of existing access products or, where legacy network
elements are dismantled in due course, through the imposition of access products with at least comparable
functionality and quality to those previously available on the legacy infrastructure, in both cases subject to an
appropriate adaptable mechanism validated by the national regulatory authority that does not undermine the
incentives for co-investors.

(201) In order to enhance the consistent regulatory practice across the Union, where national regulatory authorities

conclude that the conditions of the co-investment offer are met, the Commission should be able to require the
national regulatory authority to withdraw its draft measures either refraining from imposing obligations or

L 321/74

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

intervening with regulatory obligations in order to address significant competition problems, where BEREC shares
the Commission’s serious doubts as to the compatibility of the draft measure with Union law and in particular the
regulatory objectives of this Directive. In the interest of efficiency, a national regulatory authority should be able to
submit a single notification to the Commission of a draft measure that relates to a co-investment scheme that meets
the relevant conditions. Where the Commission does not exercise its powers to require the withdrawal of the draft
measure, it would be disproportionate for subsequent simplified notifications of individual draft decisions of the
national regulatory authority on the basis of the same scheme, including in addition evidence of actual conclusion of
an agreement with at least one co-investor, to be subject to a decision requiring withdrawal in the absence of a
change in circumstances. Furthermore, obligations imposed on undertakings, irrespective of whether they are
designated as having significant market power, pursuant to this Directive or to Directive 2014/61/EU continue to
apply. Obligations in relation to co-investment agreements are without prejudice to the application of Union law.

(202) The purpose of functional separation, whereby the vertically integrated undertaking is required to establish

operationally separate business entities, is to ensure the provision of fully equivalent access products to all
downstream operators, including the operator’s own vertically integrated downstream divisions. Functional
separation has the capacity to improve competition in several relevant markets by significantly reducing the
incentive for discrimination and by making it easier to verify and enforce compliance with non-discrimination
obligations. In exceptional cases, it should be possible for functional separation to be justified as a remedy where
there has been persistent failure to achieve effective non-discrimination in several of the markets concerned, and
where there is little or no prospect of infrastructure competition within a reasonable time-frame after recourse to
one or more remedies previously considered to be appropriate. However, it is very important to ensure that its
imposition preserves the incentives of the undertaking concerned to invest in its network and that it does not entail
any potential negative effects on consumer welfare. Its imposition requires a coordinated analysis of different
relevant markets related to the access network, in accordance with the market analysis procedure. When undertaking
the market analysis and designing the details of that remedy, national regulatory authorities should pay particular
attention to the products to be managed by the separate business entities, taking into account the extent of network
roll-out and the degree of technological progress, which may affect the substitutability of fixed and wireless services.
In order to avoid distortions of competition in the internal market, proposals for functional separation should be
approved in advance by the Commission.

(203) The implementation of functional separation should not prevent appropriate coordination mechanisms between the

different separate business entities in order to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the
parent company are protected.

(204) Where a vertically integrated undertaking chooses to transfer a substantial part or all of its local access network

assets to a separate legal entity under different ownership or by establishing a separate business entity for dealing
with access products, the national regulatory authority should assess the effect of the intended transaction, including
any access commitments offered by this undertaking, on all existing regulatory obligations imposed on the vertically
integrated undertaking in order to ensure the compatibility of any new arrangements with this Directive. The
national regulatory authority concerned should undertake a new analysis of the markets in which the segregated
entity operates, and impose, maintain, amend or withdraw obligations accordingly. To that end, the national
regulatory authority should be able to request information from the undertaking.

(205) It is already possible today in some markets that as part of the market analysis the undertakings designated as having

significant market power are able to offer commitments which aim to address competition problems identified by
the national regulatory authority and which the national regulatory authority then takes into account in deciding on
the appropriate regulatory obligations. Any new market developments should be taken into account in deciding on
the most appropriate remedies. However, and without prejudice to the provisions on regulatory treatment of coinvestments, the nature of the commitments offered as such does not limit the discretion accorded to the national
regulatory authority to impose remedies on undertakings designated as having significant market power. In order to
enhance transparency and to provide legal certainty across the Union, the procedure for undertakings to offer

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/75

commitments and for the national regulatory authorities to assess them, taking into account the views of market
participants by means of a market test, and if appropriate to make them binding on the committing undertaking and
enforceable by the national regulatory authority, should be laid down in this Directive. Unless the national regulatory
authority has made commitments on co-investments binding and decided not to impose obligations, that procedure
is without prejudice to the application of the market analysis procedure and the obligation to impose appropriate
and proportionate remedies to address the identified market failure.

(206) National regulatory authorities should be able to make the commitments binding, wholly or in part, for a specific

period which should not exceed the period for which they are offered, after having conducted a market test by
means of a public consultation of interested parties. Where the commitments have been made binding, the national
regulatory authority should consider the consequences of this decision in its market analysis and take them into
account when choosing the most appropriate regulatory measures. National regulatory authorities should consider
the commitments made from a forward-looking perspective of sustainability, in particular when choosing the period
for which they are made binding, and should have regard to the value placed by stakeholders in the public
consultation on stable and predictable market conditions. Binding commitments related to voluntary separation by a
vertically integrated undertaking which has been designated as having significant market power in one or more
relevant markets can add predictability and transparency to the process, by setting out the process of
implementation of the planned separation, for example by providing a roadmap for implementation with clear
milestones and predictable consequences if certain milestones are not met.

(207) The commitments can include the appointment of a monitoring trustee, whose identity and mandate should be

approved by the national regulatory authority, and the obligation on the undertaking offering them to provide
periodic implementation reports.

(208) Network owners whose business model is limited to the provision of wholesale services to others, can be beneficial

to the creation of a thriving wholesale market, with positive effects on retail competition downstream. Furthermore,
their business model can be attractive to potential financial investors in less volatile infrastructure assets and with
longer term perspectives on deployment of very high capacity networks. Nevertheless, the presence of a wholesaleonly undertaking does not necessarily lead to effectively competitive retail markets, and wholesale-only undertakings
can be designated as having significant market power in particular product and geographic markets. Certain
competition risks arising from the behaviour of undertakings following wholesale-only business models might be
lower than for vertically integrated undertakings, provided the wholesale-only model is genuine and no incentives to
discriminate between downstream providers exist. The regulatory response should therefore be commensurately less
intrusive, but should preserve in particular the possibility to introduce obligations in relation to fair and reasonable
pricing. On the other hand, national regulatory authorities should be able to intervene if competition problems have
arisen to the detriment of end-users. An undertaking active on a wholesale market that supplies retail services solely
to business users larger than small and medium-sized enterprises should be regarded as a wholesale-only
undertaking.

(209) To facilitate the migration from legacy copper networks to next-generation networks, which is in the interests of

end-users, national regulatory authorities should be able to monitor network operators’ own initiatives in this
respect and to establish, where necessary, the conditions for an appropriate migration process, for example by means
of prior notice, transparency and availability of alternative access products of at least comparable quality, once the
network owner has demonstrated the intent and readiness to switch to upgraded networks. In order to avoid
unjustified delays to the migration, national regulatory authorities should be empowered to withdraw access
obligations relating to the copper network once an adequate migration process has been established and compliance
with conditions and process for migration from legacy infrastructure is ensured. However, network owners should
be able to decommission legacy networks. Access seekers migrating from an access product based on legacy

L 321/76

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

infrastructure to an access product based on a more advanced technology or medium should be able to upgrade their
access to any regulated product with higher capacity, but should not be required to do so. In the case of an upgrade,
access seekers should adhere to the regulatory conditions for access to the higher capacity access product, as
determined by the national regulatory authority in its market analysis.

(210) The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector and increasing competition and choice for communications

services go hand in hand with parallel action to create a harmonised regulatory framework which secures the
delivery of universal service. The concept of universal service should evolve to reflect advances in technology, market
developments and changes in user demand.

(211) Under Article 169 TFEU, the Union is to contribute to the protection of consumers.

(212) Universal service is a safety net to ensure that a set of at least the minimum services is available to all end-users and

at an affordable price to consumers, where a risk of social exclusion arising from the lack of such access prevents
citizens from full social and economic participation in society.

(213) Basic broadband internet access is virtually universally available across the Union and very widely used for a broad

range of activities. However, the overall take-up rate is lower than availability as there are still those who are
disconnected due to reasons related to awareness, cost, skills and due to choice. Affordable adequate broadband
internet access has become of crucial importance to society and the wider economy. It provides the basis for
participation in the digital economy and society through essential online internet services.

(214) A fundamental requirement of universal service is to ensure that all consumers have access at an affordable price to

an available adequate broadband internet access and voice communications services, at a fixed location.
Member States should also have the possibility to ensure affordability of adequate broadband internet access and
voice communications services other than at a fixed location to citizens on the move, where they consider that this
is necessary to ensure consumers' full social and economic participation in society. Particular attention should be
paid in that context to ensuring that end-users with disabilities have equivalent access. There should be no
limitations on the technical means by which the connection is provided, allowing for wired or wireless technologies,
nor any limitations on the category of providers which provide part or all of universal service obligations.

(215) The speed of internet access experienced by a given user depends on a number of factors, including the providers of

internet connectivity as well as the given application for which a connection is being used. It is for the
Member States, taking into account BEREC’s report on best practices, to define adequate broadband internet access
in light of national conditions and the minimum bandwidth enjoyed by the majority of consumers within a
Member State’s territory in order to allow an adequate level of social inclusion and participation in the digital
economy and society in their territory. The affordable adequate broadband internet access service should have
sufficient bandwidth to support access to and use of at least a minimum set of basic services that reflect the services
used by the majority of end-users. To that end, the Commission should monitor the development in the use of the
internet to identify those online services used by a majority of end-users across the Union and necessary for social
and economic participation in society and update the list accordingly. The requirements of Union law on open
internet access, in particular of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, should apply to any adequate broadband internet access
service.

(216) Consumers should not be obliged to access services they do not want and it should therefore be possible for eligible

consumers to restrict, on request, the affordable universal service to voice communications services.

(217) Member States should be able to extend measures related to affordability and control of expenditure measures to

microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises and not-for-profit organisations, provided they fulfil the
relevant conditions.

(218) National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities should be able to monitor the

evolution and level of retail tariffs for services that fall within the scope of universal service obligations. Such
monitoring should be carried out in such a way that it would not represent an excessive administrative burden for
either national regulatory and other competent authorities or providers of such services.

(219) An affordable price means a price defined by Member States at national level in light of specific national conditions.

Where Member States establish that retail prices for adequate broadband internet access and voice communications
services are not affordable to consumers with low-income or special social needs, including older people, end-users
with disabilities and consumers living in rural or geographically isolated areas, they should take appropriate
measures. To that end, Member States could provide those consumers with direct support for communication
purposes, which could be part of social allowances or vouchers for, or direct payments to, those consumers. This can
be an appropriate alternative having regard to the need to minimise market distortions. Alternatively, or in addition,
Member States could require providers of such services to offer basic tariff options or packages to those consumers.

(220) Ensuring affordability may involve special tariff options or packages to deal with the needs of low-income users or

users with special social needs. Such offers should be provided with basic features, in order to avoid distortion of the
functioning of the market. Affordability for individual consumers should be founded upon their right to contract
with a provider, availability of a number, continued connection of service and their ability to monitor and control
their expenditure.

(221) Where a Member State requires providers to offer to consumers with a low-income or special social needs tariff

options or packages different from those provided under normal commercial conditions, those tariff options or
packages should be provided by all providers of internet access and voice communication services. In accordance
with the principle of proportionality, requiring all providers of internet access and voice communication services to
offer tariff options or packages should not result in excessive administrative or financial burden for those providers
or Member States. Where a Member State demonstrates such an excessive administrative or financial burden, on the
basis of an objective assessment, it might exceptionally decide to impose the obligation to offer specific tariff options
or packages only on designated providers. The objective assessment should also consider the benefits arising for
consumers with a low-income or special social needs from a choice of providers and the benefits for all providers
being able to benefit from being a universal service provider. Where a Member State exceptionally decides to impose
the obligation to offer specific tariff options or packages only on designated providers, they should ensure that
consumers with low income or special needs have a choice of providers offering social tariffs. However, in certain
situations Member States might not be able to guarantee a choice of providers, for example where only one
undertaking provides services in the area of residence of the beneficiary, or if providing a choice would put an
excessive additional organisational and financial burden on the Member State.

(222) Affordability should no longer be a barrier to consumers’ access to the minimum set of connectivity services. A right

to contract with a provider should mean that consumers who might face refusal, in particular those with a lowincome or special social needs, should have the possibility to enter into a contract for the provision of affordable
adequate broadband internet access and voice communications services at least at a fixed location with any provider
of such services in that location or a designated provider, where a Member State has exceptionally decided to
designate one or more providers to offer those tariff options or packages. In order to minimise the financial risks
such as non-payment of bills, providers should be free to provide the contract under pre-payment terms, on the basis
of affordable individual pre-paid units.

L 321/78

EN

(223) In order to ensure that citizens are reachable by voice communications services, Member States should ensure the

availability of a number for a reasonable period also during periods of non-use of voice communications services.
Providers should be able to put in place mechanisms to check the continued interest of the consumer in keeping the
availability of the number.

(224) Compensating providers of such services in such circumstances need not result in the distortion of competition,

provided that such providers are compensated for the specific net cost involved and provided that the net cost
burden is recovered in a competitively neutral way.

(225) In order to assess the need for affordability measures, national regulatory authorities in coordination with other

competent authorities should be able to monitor the evolution and details of offers of tariff options or packages for
consumers with a low-income or special social needs.

(226) Member States should introduce measures to promote the creation of a market for affordable products and services

incorporating facilities for consumers with disabilities, including equipment with assistive technologies. This can be
achieved, inter alia, by referring to European standards, or by supporting the implementation of requirements under
Union law harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services. Member States should introduce
appropriate measures in accordance with national circumstances, which gives flexibility for Member States to take
specific measures for instance if the market is not delivering affordable products and services incorporating facilities
for consumers with disabilities under normal economic conditions. Those measures could include direct financial
support to end-users. The cost to consumers with disabilities of relay services should be equivalent to the average
cost of voice communications services.

(227) Relay services refer to services which enable two-way communication between remote end-users of different modes

of communication (for example text, sign, speech) by providing conversion between those modes of
communication, normally by a human operator. Real time text is defined in accordance with Union law
harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services and refers to form of text conversation in point to
point situations or in multipoint conferencing where the text being entered is sent in such a way that the
communication is perceived by the user as being continuous on a character-by-character basis.

(228) For data communications at data rates that are sufficient to permit an adequate broadband internet access, fixed-line

connections are nearly universally available and used by a majority of citizens of the Union. The standard fixed
broadband coverage and availability in the Union stood at 97 % of homes in 2015, with an average take-up rate
of 72 %, and services based on wireless technologies have even greater reach. However, there are differences between
Member States as regards availability and affordability of fixed broadband across urban and rural areas.

(229) The market has a leading role to play in ensuring availability of broadband internet access with constantly growing

capacity. In areas where the market would not deliver, other public policy tools to support availability of adequate
broadband internet access connections appear, in principle, more cost-effective and less market-distortive than
universal service obligations, for example recourse to financial instruments such as those available under the
European Fund for Strategic Investments and Connecting Europe Facility, the use of public funding from the
European structural and investment funds, attaching coverage obligations to rights of use for radio spectrum to
support the deployment of broadband networks in less densely populated areas and public investment in accordance
with Union State aid rules.

(230) If, after carrying out a due assessment, taking into account the results of the geographical survey of networks

deployment conducted by the competent authority, or the latest information available to the Member States before
the results of the first geographical survey are available, it is shown that neither the market nor public intervention
mechanisms are likely to provide end-users in certain areas with a connection capable of delivering adequate
broadband internet access service as defined by Member States and voice communications services at a fixed

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/79

location, the Member State should be able to exceptionally designate different providers or sets of providers of those
services in the different relevant parts of the national territory. In addition to the geographical survey, Member States
should be able to use, where necessary, any additional evidence to establish to what extent adequate broadband
internet access and voice communications services are available at a fixed location. That additional evidence could
include data available to the national regulatory authorities through the market analysis procedure and data collected
from users. Member States should be able to restrict universal service obligations in support of availability of
adequate broadband internet access services to the end-user’s primary location or residence. There should be no
constraints on the technical means by which the adequate broadband internet access and voice communications
services at a fixed location are provided, allowing for wired or wireless technologies, nor any constraints on which
undertakings provide part or all of universal service obligations.

(231) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is for the Member States to decide on the basis of objective criteria

which undertakings are designated as universal service providers, where appropriate taking into account the ability
and the willingness of undertakings to accept all or part of the universal service obligations. This does not preclude
Member States from including, in the designation process, specific conditions justified on grounds of efficiency,
including grouping geographical areas or components or setting minimum periods for the designation.

(232) The costs of ensuring the availability of a connection capable of delivering an adequate broadband internet access

service as identified in accordance with this Directive and voice communications services at a fixed location at an
affordable price within the universal service obligations should be estimated, in particular by assessing the expected
financial burden for providers and users in the electronic communications sector.

(233) A priori, requirements to ensure nation-wide territorial coverage imposed in the designation procedure are likely to

exclude or dissuade certain undertakings from applying for being designated as universal service providers.
Designating providers with universal service obligations for an excessive or indefinite period might also lead to an a
priori exclusion of certain providers. Where a Member State decides to designate one or more providers for
affordability purposes, it should be possible for those providers to be different from those designated for the
availability element of universal service.

(234) When a provider that is, on an exceptional basis, designated to provide tariff options or packages different from

those provided under normal commercial conditions, as identified in accordance with this Directive or to ensure the
availability at a fixed location of an adequate broadband internet access service or voice communications services, as
identified in accordance with this Directive, chooses to dispose of a substantial part, viewed in light of its universal
service obligations, or all, of its local access network assets in the national territory to a separate legal entity under
different ultimate ownership, the competent authority should assess the effects of the transaction in order to ensure
the continuity of universal service obligations in all or parts of the national territory. To that end, the competent
authority which imposed the universal service obligations should be informed by the provider in advance of the
disposal. The assessment of the competent authority should not prejudice the completion of the transaction.

(235) In order to provide stability and support a gradual transition, Member States should be able to continue to ensure

the provision of universal service in their territory, other than adequate broadband internet access and voice
communications services at a fixed location, that are included in the scope of their universal service obligations on
the basis of Directive 2002/22/EC on the date of entry into force of this Directive, provided the services or
comparable services are not available under normal commercial circumstances. Allowing the continuation of the
provision of public payphones to the general public by use of coins, credit or debit cards, or pre-payment cards,
including cards for use with dialling codes, directories and directory enquiry services under the universal service
regime, for as long as the need is demonstrated, would give Member States the flexibility necessary to duly take into

L 321/80

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

account the varying national circumstances. This can include providing public pay telephones in the main entry
points of the country, such as airports or train and bus stations, as well as places used by people in the case of an
emergency, such as hospitals, police stations and highway emergency areas, to meet the reasonable needs of endusers, including in particular end-users with disabilities.

(236) Member States should monitor the situation of consumers with respect to their use of adequate broadband internet

access and voice communications services and in particular with respect to affordability. The affordability of
adequate broadband internet access and voice communications services is related to the information which users
receive regarding usage expenses as well as the relative cost of usage compared to other services, and is also related
to their ability to control expenditure. Affordability therefore means giving power to consumers through obligations
imposed on providers. Those obligations include a specified level of itemised billing, the possibility for consumers
selectively to block certain calls, such as high-priced calls to premium services, to control expenditure via prepayment means, and to offset up-front connection fees. Such measures may need to be reviewed and changed in
light of market developments. Itemised bills on the usage of internet access should indicate only the time, duration
and amount of consumption during a usage session but not indicate the websites or internet end-points connected
to during such a usage session.

(237) Except in cases of persistent late payment or non-payment of bills, consumers entitled to affordable tariffs should,

pending resolution of the dispute, be protected from immediate disconnection from the network on the grounds of
an unpaid bill and, in particular, in the case of disputes over high bills for premium-rate services, continue to have
access to essential voice communications services and a minimum service level of internet access as defined by
Member States. It should be possible for Member States to decide that such access is to continue to be provided only
if the subscriber continues to pay line rental or basic internet access charges.

(238) Where the provision of adequate broadband internet access and voice communications services or the provision of

other services in accordance with this Directive result in an unfair burden on a provider, taking due account of the
costs and revenues as well as the intangible benefits resulting from the provision of the services concerned, that
unfair burden can be included in any net cost calculation of universal service obligations.

(239) Member States should, where necessary, establish mechanisms for financing the net cost of universal service

obligations where it is demonstrated that the obligations can only be provided at a loss or at a net cost which falls
outside normal commercial standards. It is important to ensure that the net cost of universal service obligations is
properly calculated and that any financing is undertaken with minimum distortion to the market and to
undertakings, and is compatible with Articles 107 and 108 TFEU.

(240) Any calculation of the net cost of universal service obligations should take due account of costs and revenues, as well

as the intangible benefits resulting from providing universal service, but should not hinder the general aim of
ensuring that pricing structures reflect costs. Any net costs of universal service obligations should be calculated on
the basis of transparent procedures.

(241) Taking into account intangible benefits means that an estimate in monetary terms, of the indirect benefits that an

undertaking derives by virtue of its position as universal service provider, should be deducted from the direct net
cost of universal service obligations in order to determine the overall cost burden.

(242) When a universal service obligation represents an unfair burden on a provider, it is appropriate to allow

Member States to establish mechanisms for efficiently recovering net costs. Recovery via public funds constitutes one
method of recovering the net costs of universal service obligations. Sharing the net costs of universal service
obligations between providers of electronic communications networks and services is another method.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/81

Member States should be able to finance the net costs of different elements of universal service through different
mechanisms, or to finance the net costs of some or all elements from either of the mechanisms or a combination of
both. Adequate broadband internet access brings benefits not only to the electronic communications sector but also
to the wider online economy and to society as a whole. Providing a connection which supports broadband speeds to
an increased number of end-users enables them to use online services and so actively to participate in the digital
society. Ensuring such connections on the basis of universal service obligations serves both the public interest and
the interests of electronic communications providers. Those facts should be taken into account by Member States
when choosing and designing mechanisms for recovering net costs.

(243) In the case of cost recovery by means of sharing the net cost of universal service obligations between providers of

electronic communications networks and services, Member States should ensure that the method of allocation
amongst providers is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria and is in accordance with the principle of
proportionality. This principle does not prevent Member States from exempting new entrants which have not
achieved any significant market presence. Any funding mechanism should ensure that market participants only
contribute to the financing of universal service obligations and not to other activities which are not directly linked to
the provision of the universal service obligations. Recovery mechanisms should respect the principles of Union law,
and in particular in the case of sharing mechanisms those of non-discrimination and proportionality. Any funding
mechanism should ensure that users in one Member State do not contribute to the costs of providing universal
service in another Member State. It should be possible to share the net cost of universal service obligations between
all or certain specified classes of providers. Member States should ensure that the sharing mechanism respects the
principles of transparency, least market distortion, non-discrimination and proportionality. Least market distortion
means that contributions should be recovered in a way that as far as possible minimises the impact of the financial
burden falling on end-users, for example by spreading contributions as widely as possible.

(244) Providers benefiting from universal service funding should provide national regulatory authorities with a sufficient

level of detail of the specific elements requiring such funding in order to justify their request. Member States’
schemes for the costing and financing of universal service obligations should be communicated to the Commission
for verification of compatibility with the TFEU. Member States should ensure effective transparency and control of
amounts charged to finance universal service obligations. Calculation of the net costs of providing universal service
should be based on an objective and transparent methodology to ensure the most cost-effective provision of
universal service and promote a level playing field for market participants. Making the methodology intended to be
used to calculate the net costs of individual universal service elements known in advance before implementing the
calculation could help to achieve increased transparency.

(245) Member States are not permitted to impose on market participants financial contributions which relate to measures

which are not part of the universal service obligations. Individual Member States remain free to impose special
measures (outside the scope of universal service obligations) and finance them in accordance with Union law but not
by means of contributions from market participants.

(246) In order to effectively support the free movement of goods, services and persons within the Union, it should be

possible to use certain national numbering resources, in particular certain non-geographic numbers, in an
extraterritorial manner, that is to say outside the territory of the assigning Member State. In light of the considerable
risk of fraud with respect to interpersonal communications, such extraterritorial use should be allowed only for the
provision of electronic communications services other than interpersonal communications services. Enforcement of
relevant national laws, in particular consumer protection rules and other rules related to the use of numbering
resources should be ensured by Member States independently of where the rights of use have been granted and
where the numbering resources are used within the Union. Member States remain competent to apply their national
law to numbering resources used in their territory, including where rights have been granted in another
Member State.

L 321/82

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(247) The national regulatory or other competent authorities of the Member States where numbering resources from

another Member State are used, do not have control over those numbering resources. It is therefore essential that the
national regulatory or other competent authority of the Member State which grants the rights of extraterritorial use
should also ensure the effective protection of the end-users in the Member States where those numbers are used. In
order to achieve effective protection, national regulatory or other competent authority granting rights of
extraterritorial use should attach conditions in accordance with this Directive regarding the respect by the provider
of consumer protection rules and other rules related to the use of numbering resources in those Member States
where those resources will be used.

(248) The national regulatory or other competent authorities of those Member States where numbering resources are used

should be able to request the support of the national regulatory or other competent authorities that granted the
rights of use for the numbering resources to assist in enforcing its rules. Enforcement measures by the national
regulatory or other competent authorities that granted the rights of use should include dissuasive penalties, in
particular in the case of a serious breach the withdrawal of the right of extraterritorial use for the numbering
resources assigned to the undertaking concerned. The requirements on extraterritorial use should be without
prejudice to Member States’ powers to block, on a case-by-case basis, access to numbers or services where that is
justified by reasons of fraud or misuse. The extraterritorial use of numbering resources should be without prejudice
to Union rules related to the provision of roaming services, including those relative to preventing anomalous or
abusive use of roaming services which are subject to retail price regulation and which benefit from regulated
wholesale roaming rates. Member States should continue to be able to enter into specific agreements on
extraterritorial use of numbering resources with third countries.

(249) Member States should promote over-the-air provisioning of numbering resources to facilitate switching of electronic

communications providers. Over-the-air provisioning of numbering resources enables the reprogramming of
communications equipment identifiers without physical access to the devices concerned. This feature is particularly
relevant for machine-to-machine services, that is to say services involving an automated transfer of data and
information between devices or software-based applications with limited or no human interaction. Providers of such
machine-to-machine services might not have recourse to physical access to their devices due to their use in remote
conditions, or to the large number of devices deployed or to their usage patterns. In light of the emerging machineto-machine market and new technologies, Member States should strive to ensure technology neutrality in promoting
over-the-air provisioning.

(250) Access to numbering resources on the basis of transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria is essential for

undertakings to compete in the electronic communications sector. Member States should be able to grant rights of
use for numbering resources to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks or
services in light of the increasing relevance of numbers for various Internet of Things services. All elements of
national numbering plans should be managed by national regulatory or other competent authorities, including point
codes used in network addressing. Where there is a need for harmonisation of numbering resources in the Union to
support the development of pan-European services or cross-border services, in particular new machine-to-machinebased services such as connected cars, and where the demand could not be met on the basis of the existing
numbering resources in place, the Commission can take implementing measures with the assistance of BEREC.

(251) It should be possible to fulfil the requirement to publish decisions on the granting of rights of use for numbering

resources by making those decisions publicly accessible via a website.

17.12.2018

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/83

(252) Considering the particular aspects related to the reporting of missing children, Member States should maintain their

commitment to ensure that a well-functioning service for reporting missing children is actually available in their
territories under the number ‘116000’. Member States should take appropriate measures to ensure that a sufficient
level of service quality in operating the ‘116000’ number is achieved.

(253) In parallel with the missing children hotline number ‘116000’, many Member States also ensure that children have

access to a child-friendly service operating a helpline that helps children in need of care and protection through the
use of the ‘116111’ number. Such Member States and the Commission should ensure that awareness is raised among
citizens, and in particular among children and among national child protection systems, about the existence of the
‘116111’ helpline.

(254) An internal market implies that end-users are able to access all numbers included in the national numbering plans of

other Member States and to access services using non-geographic numbers, including freephone and premium-rate
numbers, within the Union, except where the called end-user has chosen, for commercial reasons, to limit access
from certain geographical areas. End-users should also be able to access numbers from the Universal International
Freephone Numbers (UIFN). Cross-border access to numbering resources and associated services should not be
prevented, except in objectively justified cases, for example to combat fraud or abuse (for example, in connection
with certain premium-rate services), when the number is defined as having a national scope only (for example, a
national short code) or when it is economically unfeasible. Tariffs charged to parties calling from outside the
Member State concerned need not be the same as for those parties calling from inside that Member State. Users
should be fully informed in advance and in a clear manner of any charges applicable to freephone numbers, such as
international call charges for numbers accessible through standard international dialling codes. Where
interconnection or other service revenues are withheld by providers of electronic communications services for
reasons of fraud or misuse, Member States should ensure that retained service revenues are refunded to the end-users
affected by the relevant fraud or misuse where possible.

(255) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, a number of provisions on end-user rights in this Directive

should not apply to microenterprises which provide only number-independent interpersonal communications
services. According to the case law of the Court of Justice, the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises,
which includes microenterprises, is to be interpreted strictly. In order to include only enterprises that are genuinely
independent microenterprises, it is necessary to examine the structure of microenterprises which form an economic
group, the power of which exceeds the power of a microenterprise, and to ensure that the definition of
microenterprise is not circumvented by purely formal means.

(256) The completion of the single market for electronic communications requires the removal of barriers for end-users to

have cross-border access to electronic communications services across the Union. Providers of electronic
communications to the public should not deny or restrict access or discriminate against end-users on the basis of
their nationality, or Member State of residence or of establishment. Differentiation should, however, be possible on
the basis of objectively justifiable differences in costs and risks, not limited to the measures provided for in
Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 in respect of abusive or anomalous use of regulated retail roaming services.

(257) Divergent implementation of the rules on end-user protection has created significant internal market barriers

affecting both providers of electronic communications services and end-users. Those barriers should be reduced by
the applicability of the same rules ensuring a high common level of protection across the Union. A calibrated full
harmonisation of the end-user rights covered by this Directive should considerably increase legal certainty for both
end-users and providers of electronic communications services, and should significantly lower entry barriers and
unnecessary compliance burden stemming from the fragmentation of the rules. Full harmonisation helps to

L 321/84

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

overcome barriers to the functioning of the internal market resulting from such national provisions concerning enduser rights which at the same time protect national providers against competition from other Member States. In
order to achieve a high common level of protection, several provisions concerning end-user rights should be
reasonably enhanced in this Directive in light of best practices in Member States. Full harmonisation of their rights
increases the trust of end-users in the internal market as they benefit from an equally high level of protection when
using electronic communications services, not only in their Member State but also while living, working or travelling
in other Member States. Full harmonisation should extend only to the subject matters covered by the provisions on
end-user rights in this Directive. Therefore, it should not affect national law with respect to those aspects of end-user
protection, including some aspects of transparency measures which are not covered by those provisions. For
example, measures relating to transparency obligations which are not covered by this Directive should be considered
to be compatible with the principle of full harmonisation whereas additional requirements regarding transparency
issues covered by this Directive, such as publication of information, should be considered to be incompatible.
Moreover, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce national provisions on issues not specifically
addressed in this Directive, in particular in order to address newly emerging issues.

(258) Contracts are an important tool for end- users to ensure transparency of information and legal certainty. Most

service providers in a competitive environment will conclude contracts with their customers for reasons of
commercial desirability. In addition to this Directive, the requirements of existing Union consumer protection law
relating to contracts, in particular Council Directive 93/13/EEC (1) and Directive 2011/83/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council (2), apply to consumer transactions relating to electronic communications
networks and services. The inclusion of information requirements in this Directive, which might also be required
pursuant to Directive 2011/83/EU, should not lead to duplication of the information within pre-contractual and
contractual documents. Relevant information provided in respect of this Directive, including any more prescriptive
and more detailed informational requirements, should be considered to fulfil the corresponding requirements
pursuant to Directive 2011/83/EU.

(259) Some of those end-user protection provisions which a priori apply only to consumers, namely those on contract

information, maximum contract duration and bundles, should benefit not only consumers, but also
microenterprises and small enterprises, and not-for-profit organisations as defined in national law. The bargaining
position of those categories of enterprises and organisations is comparable to that of consumers and they should
therefore benefit from the same level of protection unless they explicitly waive those rights. Obligations on contract
information in this Directive, including those of Directive 2011/83/EU that are referred to in this Directive, should
apply irrespective of whether any payment is made and of the amount of the payment to be made by the customer.
The obligations on contract information, including those contained in Directive 2011/83/EU, should apply
automatically to microenterprises, small enterprises and not-for-profit organisations unless they prefer negotiating
individualised contract terms with providers of electronic communications services. As opposed to microenterprises,
small enterprises and not-for-profit organisations, larger enterprises usually have stronger bargaining power and do,
therefore, not depend on the same contractual information requirements as consumers. Other provisions, such as
number portability, which are important also for larger enterprises should continue to apply to all end-users. Notfor-profit organisations are legal entities that do not earn a profit for their owners or members. Typically, not-forprofit organisations are charities or other types of public interest organisations. Hence, in light of the comparable
situation, it is legitimate to treat such organisations in the same way as microenterprises or small enterprises under
this Directive, insofar as end-user rights are concerned.

577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, p. 64).

(260) The specificities of the electronic communications sector require, beyond horizontal contract rules, a limited number

of additional end-user protection provisions. End-users should be informed, inter alia, of any quality of service levels
offered, conditions for promotions and termination of contracts, applicable tariff plans and tariffs for services
subject to particular pricing conditions. That information is relevant for providers of publicly available electronic
communications services other than transmission services used for the provision of machine-to-machine services.
Without prejudice to the applicable rules on the protection of personal data, a provider of publicly available
electronic communications services should not be subject to the obligations on information requirements for
contracts where that provider, and affiliated companies or persons, do not receive any remuneration directly or
indirectly linked to the provision of electronic communications services, such as where a university gives visitors free
access to its Wi-Fi network on campus without receiving any remuneration, whether through payment from the
users or through advertising revenues.

(261) In order to enable the end-user to make a well-informed choice, it is essential that the required relevant information

is provided prior to the conclusion of the contract and in clear and understandable language and on a durable
medium or, where not feasible and without prejudice to the definition of durable medium set out in Directive 2011/
83/EU, in a document, made available by the provider and notified to the user, that is easy to download, open and
consult on devices commonly used by consumers. In order to facilitate choice, providers should also present a
summary of the essential contract terms. In order to facilitate comparability and reduce compliance cost, the
Commission should, after consulting BEREC, adopt a template for such contract summaries. The pre-contractually
provided information as well as the summary template should constitute an integral part of the final contract. The
contract summary should be concise and easily readable, ideally no longer than the equivalent of one single-sided
A4 page or, where a number of different services are bundled into a single contract, the equivalent of up to three
single-sided A4 pages.

(262) Following the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, the provisions in this Directive regarding information on

conditions limiting access to, or the use of, services and applications as well as information on traffic shaping
became obsolete and should be repealed.

(263) With respect to terminal equipment, the customer contract should specify any conditions imposed by the provider

on the use of the equipment, such as by way of ‘SIM-locking’ mobile devices, if such conditions are not prohibited
under national law, and any charges due on termination of the contract, whether before or on the agreed expiry date,
including any cost imposed in order to retain the equipment. Where the end-user chooses to retain terminal
equipment bundled at the moment of the contract conclusion, any compensation due should not exceed its pro rata
temporis value calculated on the basis of the value at the moment of the contract conclusion, or on the remaining
part of the service fee until the end of the contract, whichever amount is smaller. Member States should be able to
choose other methods of calculating the compensation rate, where such a rate is equal to or less than that
compensation calculated. Any restriction to the usage of terminal equipment on other networks should be lifted, free
of charge, by the provider at the latest upon payment of such compensation.

(264) Without prejudice to the substantive obligation on the provider related to security by virtue of this Directive, the

contract should specify the type of action the provider might take in the case of security incidents, threats or
vulnerabilities. In addition, the contract should also specify any compensation and refund arrangements available if a
provider responds inadequately to a security incident, including if a security incident, notified to the provider, takes
place due to known software or hardware vulnerabilities, for which patches have been issued by the manufacturer or
developer and the service provider has not applied those patches or taken any other appropriate counter-measure.

(265) The availability of transparent, up-to-date and comparable information on offers and services is a key element for

consumers in competitive markets where several providers offer services. End-users should be able to compare the
prices of various services offered on the market easily on the basis of information published in an easily accessible

L 321/86

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

form. In order to allow them to make price and service comparisons easily, competent authorities in coordination,
where relevant, with national regulatory authorities should be able to require from providers of internet access
services or publicly available interpersonal communication services greater transparency as regards information,
including tariffs, quality of service, conditions on terminal equipment supplied, and other relevant statistics. Any
such requirements should take due account of the characteristics of those networks or services. They should also
ensure that third parties have the right to use, without charge, publicly available information published by such
undertakings, with a view to providing comparison tools.

(266) End-users are often not aware of the cost of their consumption behaviour or have difficulties in estimating their time

or data consumption when using electronic communications services. In order to increase transparency and to allow
for better control of their communications budget, it is important to provide end-users with facilities that enable
them to track their consumption in a timely manner. In addition, Member States should be able to maintain or
introduce provisions on consumption limits protecting end-users against ‘bill-shocks’, including in relation to
premium rate services and other services subject to particular pricing conditions. This allows competent authorities
to require information about such prices to be provided prior to providing the service and does not prejudice the
possibility of Member States to maintain or introduce general obligations for premium rate services to ensure the
effective protection of end-users.

(267) Independent comparison tools, such as websites, are an effective means for end-users to assess the merits of different

providers of internet access services and interpersonal communications services, where provided against recurring
or consumption-based direct monetary payments, and to obtain impartial information, in particular by comparing
prices, tariffs, and quality parameters in one place. Such tools should be operationally independent from service
providers and no service provider should be given favourable treatment in search results. Such tools should aim to
provide information that is both clear and concise, and complete and comprehensive. They should also aim to
include the broadest possible range of offers, in order to give a representative overview and cover a significant part
of the market. The information given on such tools should be trustworthy, impartial and transparent. End-users
should be informed of the availability of such tools. Member States should ensure that end-users have free access to
at least one such tool in their respective territories. Where there is only one tool in a Member State and that tool
ceases to operate or ceases to comply with the quality criteria, the Member State should ensure that end-users have
access within a reasonable time to another comparison tool at national level.

(268) Independent comparison tools can be operated by private undertakings, or by or on behalf of competent authorities,

however they should be operated in accordance with specified quality criteria including the requirement to provide
details of their owners, provide accurate and up-to-date information, state the time of the last update, set out clear,
objective criteria on which the comparison will be based, and include a broad range of offers covering a significant
part of the market. Member States should be able to determine how often comparison tools are required to review
and update the information they provide to end-users, taking into account the frequency with which providers of
internet access services and of publicly available interpersonal communications services, generally update their tariff
and quality information.

(269) In order to address public interest issues with respect to the use of internet access services and publicly available

number-based interpersonal communications services and to encourage protection of the rights and freedoms of
others, Member States should be able to produce and disseminate or have disseminated, with the aid of providers of
such services, public-interest information related to the use of such services. It should be possible for such
information to include public-interest information regarding the most common infringements and their legal

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/87

consequences, for instance regarding copyright infringement, other unlawful uses and the dissemination of harmful
content, and advice and means of protection against risks to personal security, for example those arising from
disclosure of personal information in certain circumstances, as well as risks to privacy and personal data, and the
availability of easy-to-use and configurable software or software options allowing protection for children or
vulnerable persons. The information could be coordinated by way of the cooperation procedure established in this
Directive. Such public-interest information should be updated where necessary and should be presented in easily
comprehensible formats, as determined by each Member State, and on national public authority websites.
Member States should be able to oblige providers of internet access services and publicly available number-based
interpersonal communications services to disseminate this standardised information to all of their customers in a
manner considered to be appropriate by the national public authorities. Dissemination of such information should,
however, not impose an excessive burden on providers. If it does so, Member States should require such
dissemination by the means used by providers in communications with end-users made in the ordinary course of
business.

(270) In the absence of relevant rules of Union law, content, applications and services are considered to be lawful or

harmful in accordance with national substantive and procedural law. It is a task for the Member States, not for
providers of electronic communications networks or services, to decide, in accordance with due process, whether
content, applications or services are lawful or harmful. This Directive and Directive 2002/58/EC are without
prejudice to Directive 2000/31/EC, which, inter alia, contains a ‘mere conduit’ rule for intermediary service
providers, as defined therein.

(271) National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities, or where relevant, other

competent authorities in co-ordination with national regulatory authorities should be empowered to monitor the
quality of services and to collect systematically information on the quality of services offered by providers of internet
access services and of publicly available interpersonal communications services, to the extent that the latter are able
to offer minimum levels of service quality either through control of at least some elements of the network or by
virtue of a service level agreement to that end, including the quality related to the provision of services to end-users
with disabilities. That information should be collected on the basis of criteria which allow comparability between
service providers and between Member States. Providers of such electronic communications services, operating in a
competitive environment, are likely to make adequate and up-to-date information on their services publicly available
for reasons of commercial advantage. National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent
authorities, or where relevant, other competent authorities in co-ordination with national regulatory authorities
should nonetheless be able to require publication of such information where it is demonstrated that such
information is not effectively available to the public. Where the quality of services of publicly available interpersonal
communication services depends on any external factors, such as control of signal transmission or network
connectivity, national regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities should be able to
require providers of such services to inform their consumers accordingly.

(272) National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities should also set out the

measurement methods to be applied by the service providers in order to improve the comparability of the data
provided. In order to facilitate comparability across the Union and to reduce compliance cost, BEREC should adopt
guidelines on relevant quality of service parameters which national regulatory authorities in coordination with other
competent authorities should take into utmost account.

(273) In order to take full advantage of the competitive environment, consumers should be able to make informed choices

and to change providers when it is in their best interest to do so. It is essential to ensure that they are able to do so
without being hindered by legal, technical or practical obstacles, including contractual conditions, procedures and
charges. That does not preclude providers from setting reasonable minimum contractual periods of up to 24 months
in consumer contracts. However, Member States should have the possibility to maintain or introduce provisions for
a shorter maximum duration and to permit consumers to change tariff plans or terminate the contract within the

L 321/88

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

contract period without incurring additional costs in light of national conditions, such as levels of competition and
stability of network investments. Independently from the electronic communications service contract, consumers
might prefer and benefit from a longer reimbursement period for physical connections. Such consumer
commitments can be an important factor in facilitating deployment of very high capacity networks up to or very
close to end-user premises, including through demand aggregation schemes which enable network investors to
reduce initial take-up risks. However, the rights of consumers to switch between providers of electronic
communications services, as established in this Directive, should not be restricted by such reimbursement periods in
contracts on physical connections and such contracts should not cover terminal or internet access equipment, such
as handsets, routers or modems. Member States should ensure the equal treatment of entities, including operators,
financing the deployment of a very high capacity physical connection to the premises of an end-user, including
where such financing is by way of an instalment contract.

(274) Automatic prolongation of contracts for electronic communications services is also possible. In those cases, end-

users should be able to terminate their contract without incurring any costs after the expiry of the contract term.

(275) Any changes to the contractual conditions proposed by providers of publicly available electronic communications

services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services, which are not to the benefit of the
end-user, for example in relation to charges, tariffs, data volume limitations, data speeds, coverage, or the processing
of personal data, should give rise to the right of the end-user to terminate the contract without incurring any costs,
even if they are combined with some beneficial changes. Any change to the contractual conditions by the provider
should therefore entitle the end-user to terminate the contract unless each change is in itself beneficial to the enduser, or the changes are of a purely administrative nature, such as a change in the provider’s address, and have no
negative effect on the end-user, or the changes are strictly imposed by legislative or regulatory changes, such as new
contract information requirements imposed by Union or national law. Whether a change is exclusively to the benefit
of the end-user should be assessed on the basis of objective criteria. The end-user’s right to terminate the contract
should be excluded only if the provider is able to demonstrate that all contract changes are exclusively to the benefit
of the end-user or are of a purely administrative nature without any negative effect on the end-user.

(276) End-users should be notified of any changes to the contractual conditions by means of a durable medium. End-users

other than consumers, microenterprises or small enterprises, or not-for-profit organisations should not benefit from
the termination rights in the case of contract modification, insofar as transmission services used for machine-tomachine services are concerned. Member States should be able to provide for specific end-user protections regarding
contract termination where the end-users change their place of residence. The provisions on contract termination
should be without prejudice to other provisions of Union or national law concerning the grounds on which
contracts can be terminated or on which contractual terms and conditions can be changed by the service provider or
by the end-user.

(277) The possibility of switching between providers is key for effective competition in a competitive environment. The

availability of transparent, accurate and timely information on switching should increase the end-users’ confidence in
switching and make them more willing to engage actively in the competitive process. Service providers should
ensure continuity of service so that end-users are able to switch providers without being hindered by the risk of a
loss of service and, where technically possible, allow for switching on the date requested by end-users.

(278) Number portability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition in competitive electronic

communications markets. End-users who so request should be able to retain their numbers independently of the

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/89

provider of service and for a limited time between the switching of providers of service. The provision of this facility
between connections to the public telephone network at fixed and non-fixed locations is not covered by this
Directive. However, Member States should be able to apply provisions for porting numbers between networks
providing services at a fixed location and mobile networks.

(279) The impact of number portability is considerably strengthened when there is transparent tariff information, both for

end-users who port their numbers and for end-users who call those who have ported their numbers. National
regulatory authorities should, where feasible, facilitate appropriate tariff transparency as part of the implementation
of number portability.

(280) When ensuring that pricing for interconnection related to the provision of number portability is cost-oriented,

national regulatory authorities should also be able to take account of prices available in comparable markets.

(281) Number portability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition in competitive markets for

electronic communications and should be implemented with the minimum delay, so that the number is functionally
activated within one working day and the end-user does not experience a loss of service lasting longer than one
working day from the agreed date. The right to port the number should be attributed to the end-user who has the
relevant (pre- or post-paid) contract with the provider. In order to facilitate a one-stop-shop enabling a seamless
switching experience for end- users, the switching process should be led by the receiving provider of electronic
communications to the public. National regulatory or, where relevant, other competent authorities should be able to
prescribe the global process of the switching and of the porting of numbers, taking into account national provisions
on contracts and technological developments. This should include, where available, a requirement for the porting to
be completed though over-the-air provisioning, unless an end-user requests otherwise. Experience in certain
Member States has shown that there is a risk of end-users being switched to another provider without having given
their consent. While that is a matter that should primarily be addressed by law enforcement authorities,
Member States should be able to impose such minimum proportionate measures regarding the switching process,
including appropriate penalties, as are necessary to minimise such risks, and to ensure that end-users are protected
throughout the switching process without making the process less attractive for them. The right to port numbers
should not be restricted by contractual conditions.

(282) In order to ensure that switching and porting take place within the time-limits provided for in this Directive,

Member States should provide for the compensation of end-users by providers in an easy and timely manner where
an agreement between a provider and an end-user is not respected. Such measures should be proportionate to the
length of the delay in complying with the agreement. End-users should at least be compensated for delays exceeding
one working day in activation of service, porting of a number, or loss of service, and where providers miss agreed
service or installation appointments. Additional compensation could also be in the form of an automatic reduction
of the remuneration where the transferring provider is to continue providing its services until the services of the
receiving provider are activated.

(283) Bundles comprising at least either an internet access service or a publicly available number-based interpersonal

communications service, as well as other services, such as publicly available number-independent interpersonal
communications services, linear broadcasting and machine-to-machine services, or terminal equipment, have
become increasingly widespread and are an important element of competition. For the purposes of this Directive, a
bundle should be considered to exist in situations where the elements of the bundle are provided or sold by the same
provider under the same or a closely related or linked contract. While bundles often bring about benefits for
consumers, they can make switching more difficult or costly and raise risks of contractual ‘lock-in’. Where different
services and terminal equipment within a bundle are subject to divergent rules on contract termination and
switching or on contractual commitments regarding the acquisition of terminal equipment, consumers are
effectively hampered in their rights under this Directive to switch to competitive offers for the entire bundle or parts

L 321/90

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

of it. Certain essential provisions of this Directive regarding contract summary information, transparency, contract
duration and termination and switching should, therefore, apply to all elements of a bundle, including terminal
equipment, other services such as digital content or digital services, and electronic communications services which
are not directly covered by the scope of those provisions. All end-user obligations applicable under this Directive to a
given electronic communications service when provided or sold as a stand-alone service should also be applicable
when it is part of a bundle with at least an internet access service or a publicly available number-based interpersonal
communications service. Other contractual issues, such as the remedies applicable in the event of non-conformity
with the contract, should be governed by the rules applicable to the respective element of the bundle, for instance by
the rules of contracts for the sales of goods or for the supply of digital content. However, a right to terminate any
element of a bundle comprising at least an internet access service or a publicly available number-based interpersonal
communications service before the end of the agreed contract term because of a lack of conformity or a failure to
supply should give a consumer the right to terminate all elements of the bundle. Also, in order to maintain their
capacity to switch easily providers, consumers should not be locked in with a provider by means of a contractual de
facto extension of the initial contract period.

(284) Providers of number-based interpersonal communications services have an obligation to provide access to

emergency services through emergency communications. In exceptional circumstances, namely due to a lack of
technical feasibility, they might not be able to provide access to emergency services or caller location, or to both. In
such cases, they should inform their customers adequately in the contract. Such providers should provide their
customers with clear and transparent information in the initial contract and update it in the event of any change in
the provision of access to emergency services, for example in invoices. That information should include any
limitations on territorial coverage, on the basis of the planned technical operating parameters of the
communications service and the available infrastructure. Where the service is not provided over a connection
which is managed to give a specified quality of service, the information should also include the level of reliability of
the access and of caller location information compared to a service that is provided over such a connection, taking
into account current technology and quality standards, as well as any quality of service parameters specified under
this Directive.

(285) End-users should be able to access emergency services through emergency communications free of charge and

without having to use any means of payment, from any device which enables number-based interpersonal
communications services, including when using roaming services in a Member State. Emergency communications
are a means of communication that includes not only voice communications services, but also SMS, messaging,
video or other types of communications, for example real time text, total conversation and relay services.
Member States, taking into account the capabilities and technical equipment of the PSAPs, should be able to
determine which number-based interpersonal communications services are appropriate for emergency services,
including the possibility to limit those options to voice communications services and their equivalent for end-users
with disabilities, or to add additional options as agreed with national PSAPs. Emergency communication can be
triggered on behalf of a person by an in-vehicle emergency call or an eCall as defined in Regulation (EU) 2015/758.

(286) Member States should ensure that providers of number-based interpersonal communications services provide

reliable and accurate access to emergency services, taking into account national specifications and criteria and the
capabilities of national PSAPs. Member States should consider the PSAP’s ability to handle emergency
communications in more than one language. Where the number-based interpersonal communications service is
not provided over a connection which is managed to give a specified quality of service, the service provider might
not be able to ensure that emergency calls made through their service are routed to the most appropriate PSAP with
the same reliability. For such network-independent providers, namely providers which are not integrated with a
provider of public electronic communications networks, providing caller location information may not always be
technically feasible. Member States should ensure that standards ensuring accurate and reliable routing and

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/91

connection to the emergency services are implemented as soon as possible in order to allow network-independent
providers of number-based interpersonal communications services to fulfil the obligations related to access to
emergency services and caller location information provision at a level comparable to that required of other
providers of such communications services. Where such standards and the related PSAP systems have not been
implemented, network-independent number-based interpersonal communications services should not be required to
provide access to emergency services except in a manner that is technically feasible or economically viable. This may,
for example, include the designation by a Member State of a single, central PSAP for receiving emergency
communications. Nonetheless, such providers should inform end-users when access to the single European
emergency number ‘112’ or to caller location information is not supported.

(287) In order to improve the reporting and performance measurement by Member States with respect to the answering

and handling of emergency calls, the Commission should, every two years, report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the effectiveness of the implementation of the single European emergency number ‘112’.

(288) Member States should take specific measures to ensure that emergency services, including the single European

emergency number ‘112’, are equally accessible to end-users with disabilities, in particular deaf, hearing-impaired,
speech-impaired and deaf-blind end-users and in accordance with Union law harmonising accessibility requirements
for products and services. This could involve the provision of special terminal devices for end-users with disabilities
when other ways of communication are not suitable for them.

(289) It is important to increase awareness of the single European emergency number ‘112’ in order to improve the level of

protection and security of citizens travelling in the Union. To that end, citizens should be made fully aware, when
travelling in any Member State, in particular through information provided in international bus terminals, train
stations, ports or airports and in telephone directories, end-user and billing material, that the single European
emergency number ‘112’ can be used as a single emergency number throughout the Union. This is primarily the
responsibility of the Member States, but the Commission should continue both to support and to supplement
initiatives of the Member States to heighten awareness of the single European emergency number ‘112’ and
periodically to evaluate the public’s awareness of it.

(290) Caller location information, which applies to all emergency communications, improves the level of protection and

the security of end-users and assists the emergency services in the discharge of their duties, provided that the transfer
of emergency communication and associated data to the emergency services concerned is guaranteed by the national
system of PSAPs. The reception and use of caller location information, which includes both network-based location
information and where available, enhanced handset caller location information, should comply with relevant Union
law on the processing of personal data and security measures. Undertakings that provide network-based location
should make caller location information available to emergency services as soon as the call reaches that service,
independently of the technology used. However, handset-based location technologies have proven to be significantly
more accurate and cost effective due to the availability of data provided by the European Geostationary Navigation
Overlay Service and Galileo Satellite system and other Global Navigation Satellite Systems and Wi-Fi data. Therefore,
handset-derived caller location information should complement network-based location information even if the
handset-derived location becomes available only after the emergency communication is set up. Member States
should ensure that, where available, the handset-derived caller location information is made available to the most
appropriate PSAP. This might not be always possible, for example when the location is not available on the handset
or through the interpersonal communications service used, or when it is not technically feasible to obtain that
information. Furthermore, Member States should ensure that the PSAPs are able to retrieve and manage the caller
location information available, where feasible. The establishment and transmission of caller location information

L 321/92

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

should be free of charge for both the end-user and the authority handling the emergency communication irrespective
of the means of establishment, for example through the handset or the network, or the means of transmission, for
example through voice channel, SMS or IP-based.

(291) In order to respond to technological developments concerning accurate caller location information, equivalent

access for end-users with disabilities and call routing to the most appropriate PSAP, the Commission should be
empowered to adopt by means of a delegated act measures necessary to ensure the compatibility, interoperability,
quality, reliability and continuity of emergency communications in the Union, such as functional provisions
determining the role of various parties within the communications chain, for example number-based interpersonal
communications service providers, network operators and PSAPs, as well as technical provisions determining the
technical means to fulfil the functional provisions. Such measures should be without prejudice to the organisation of
emergency services of Member States.

(292) A citizen in one Member State who needs to contact the emergency services in another Member State cannot do so

because the emergency services may not have any contact information for emergency services in other
Member States. A Union-wide, secure database of numbers for a lead emergency service in each country should
therefore be introduced. To that end, BEREC should maintain a secure database of E.164 numbers of Member State
emergency service numbers, if such a database is not maintained by another organisation, in order to ensure that the
emergency services in one Member State can be contacted by the emergency services in another.

(293) Diverging national law has developed in relation to the transmission by electronic communications services of

public warnings regarding imminent or developing major emergencies and disasters. In order to approximate law in
that area, this Directive should therefore provide that, when public warning systems are in place, public warnings
should be transmitted by providers of mobile number-based interpersonal communication services to all end-users
concerned. The end-users concerned should be considered to be those who are located in the geographic areas
potentially being affected by imminent or developing major emergencies and disasters during the warning period, as
determined by the competent authorities.

(294) Where the effective reach of all end-users concerned, independently of their place or Member State of residence, is

ensured and fulfils the highest level of data security, Member States should be able to provide for the transmission of
public warnings by publicly available electronic communications services other than mobile number-based
interpersonal communications services and other than transmission services used for broadcasting or by mobile
application transmitted via internet access services. In order to inform end-users entering a Member State of the
existence of such a public warning system, that Member State should ensure that those end-users receive,
automatically by means of SMS, without undue delay and free of charge, easily understandable information on how
to receive public warnings, including by means of mobile terminal equipment not enabled for internet access
services. Public warnings other than those relying on mobile number-based interpersonal communications services
should be transmitted to end-users in an easily receivable manner. Where a public warning system relies on an
application, it should not require end-users to log in or register with the authorities or the application provider. Endusers’ location data should be used in accordance with Directive 2002/58/EC. The transmission of public warnings
should be free of charge for end-users. In its review of the implementation of this Directive, the Commission could
also assess whether it is possible in accordance with Union law, and feasible to set up a single Union-wide public
warning system in order to alert the public in the event of an imminent or developing disaster or major state of
emergency across different Member States.

(295) Member States should be able to determine if proposals for alternative systems, other than through mobile number-

based interpersonal communication services, are truly equivalent to such services, taking utmost account of the
corresponding BEREC guidelines. Such guidelines should be developed after consulting national authorities in charge

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/93

of PSAPs in order to ensure that emergency experts have a role in their development and that there is a common
understanding between different Member State authorities as to what is needed to ensure full implementation of
such public warning systems within the Member States while ensuring that the citizens of the Union are effectively
protected while travelling in another Member State.

(296) In line with the objectives of the Charter and the obligations enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the

Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the regulatory framework should ensure that all end-users, including end-users
with disabilities, older people, and users with special social needs, have easy and equivalent access to affordable high
quality services regardless of their place of residence within the Union. Declaration 22 annexed to the final Act of
Amsterdam provides that the institutions of the Union are to take account of the needs of persons with disabilities in
drawing up measures under Article 114 TFEU.

(297) In order to ensure that end-users with disabilities benefit from competition and the choice of service providers

enjoyed by the majority of end-users, competent authorities should specify, where appropriate and in light of
national conditions, and after consulting end-users with disabilities, consumer protection requirements for end-users
with disabilities to be met by providers of publicly available electronic communications services. Such requirements
can include, in particular, that providers ensure that end-users with disabilities take advantage of their services on
equivalent terms and conditions, including prices, tariffs and quality, as those offered to their other end-users,
irrespective of any additional costs incurred by those providers. Other requirements can relate to wholesale
arrangements between providers. In order to avoid creating an excessive burden on service providers competent
authorities should verify, whether the objectives of equivalent access and choice can be achieved without such
measures.

(298) In addition to Union law harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services, this Directive sets out

new enhanced affordability and availability requirements on related terminal equipment and specific equipment and
specific services for end-users with disabilities. Therefore, the corresponding obligation in Directive 2002/22/EC that
required Member States to encourage the availability of terminal equipment for end-users with disabilities has
become obsolete and should be repealed.

(299) Effective competition has developed in the provision of directory enquiry services and directories pursuant, inter alia,

to Article 5 of Commission Directive 2002/77/EC (1). In order to maintain that effective competition, all providers of
number-based interpersonal communications services which attribute numbers from a numbering plan to their endusers should continue to be obliged to make relevant information available in a fair, cost-oriented and nondiscriminatory manner.

(300) End-users should be informed about their right to determine whether they want to be included in a directory.

Providers of number-based interpersonal communications services should respect the end-users’ decision when
making data available to directory service providers. Article 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC ensures the end-users’ right
to privacy with regard to the inclusion of their personal information in a public directory.

(301) Measures at wholesale level ensuring the inclusion of end-user data in databases should comply with the safeguards

for the protection of personal data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC. The
cost-oriented supply of that data to service providers, with the possibility for Member States to establish a centralised
mechanism for providing comprehensive aggregated information to directory providers, and the provision of
network access under reasonable and transparent conditions, should be put in place in order to ensure that end-users

and services (OJ L 249, 17.9.2002, p. 21).

benefit fully from competition, which has largely allowed the enabling of the removal of retail regulation from these
services and the provision of offers of directory services under reasonable and transparent conditions.

(302) Following the abolition of the universal service obligation for directory services and given the existence of a

functioning market for such services, the right to access directory enquiry services is no longer necessary. However,
the national regulatory authorities should still be able to impose obligations and conditions on undertakings that
control access to end-users in order to maintain access and competition in that market.

(303) End-users should be able to enjoy a guarantee of interoperability in respect of all equipment sold in the Union for the

reception of radio in new vehicles of category M and of digital television. Member States should be able to require
minimum harmonised standards in respect of such equipment. Such standards could be adapted from time to time
in light of technological and market developments.

(304) Where Member States decide to adopt measures in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/1535 for the

interoperability of consumer radio receivers, they should be capable of receiving and reproducing radio services
provided via digital terrestrial radio broadcasting or via IP networks, in order to ensure that interoperability is
maintained. This may also improve public safety, by enabling users to rely on a wider set of technologies for
accessing and receiving emergency information in the Member States.

(305) It is desirable to enable consumers to achieve the fullest connectivity possible to digital television sets.

Interoperability is an evolving concept in dynamic markets. Standardisation bodies should do their utmost to ensure
that appropriate standards evolve along with the technologies concerned. It is likewise important to ensure that
connectors are available on digital television sets that are capable of passing all the necessary elements of a digital
signal, including the audio and video streams, conditional access information, service information, API information
and copy protection information. This Directive should therefore ensure that the functionality associated to or
implemented in connectors is not limited by network operators, service providers or equipment manufacturers and
continues to evolve in line with technological developments. For display and presentation of connected television
services, the realisation of a common standard through a market-driven mechanism is recognised as a consumer
benefit. Member States and the Commission should be able to take policy initiatives, consistent with the Treaties, to
encourage this development.

(306) The provisions on interoperability of consumer radio and television equipment do not prevent car radio receivers in

new vehicles of category M from being capable of receiving and reproducing radio services provided via analogue
terrestrial radio broadcasting and those provisions do not prevent Member States from imposing obligations to
ensure that digital radio receivers are capable of receiving and reproducing analogue terrestrial radio broadcasts.

(307) Without prejudice to Union law, this Directive does not prevent Member States from adopting technical regulations

related to digital terrestrial television equipment, to prepare the migration of consumers to new terrestrial
broadcasting standards, and avoid the supply of equipment that would not be compliant with the standards to be
rolled out.

(308) Member States should be able to lay down proportionate ‘must carry’ obligations on undertakings under their

jurisdiction, in the interest of legitimate public policy considerations, but such obligations should only be imposed
where they are necessary to meet general interest objectives clearly defined by Member States in accordance with
Union law and should be proportionate and transparent. It should be possible to apply ‘must carry’ obligations to
specified radio and television broadcast channels and complementary services supplied by a specified media service
provider. Obligations imposed by Member States should be reasonable, that is they should be proportionate and
transparent in light of clearly defined general interest objectives. Member States should provide an objective

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/95

justification for the ‘must carry’ obligations that they impose in their national law in order to ensure that such
obligations are transparent, proportionate and clearly defined. The obligations should be designed in a way which
provides sufficient incentives for efficient investment in infrastructure.

(309) ‘Must carry’ obligations should be subject to periodic review at least every five years in order to keep them up-to-date

with technological and market evolution and in order to ensure that they continue to be proportionate to the
objectives to be achieved. Such obligations could, where appropriate, entail a provision for proportionate
remuneration which should be set out in national law. Where that is the case, national law should also determine the
applicable methodology for calculating appropriate remuneration. That methodology should avoid inconsistency
with access remedies that may be imposed by national regulatory authorities on providers of transmission services
used for broadcasting which have been designated as having significant market power. However, where a fixed-term
contract signed before 20 December 2018 provides for a different methodology, it should be possible to continue to
apply that methodology for the duration of the contract. In the absence of a national provision on remuneration,
providers of radio or television broadcast channels and providers of electronic communications networks used for
the transmission of those radio or television broadcast channels should be able to agree contractually on a
proportionate remuneration.

(310) Electronic communications networks and services used for the distribution of radio or television broadcasts to the

public include cable, IPTV, satellite and terrestrial broadcasting networks. They might also include other networks to
the extent that a significant number of end-users use such networks as their principal means to receive radio and
television broadcasts. ‘Must carry’ obligations related to analogue television broadcast transmissions should be
considered only where the lack of such an obligation would cause significant disruption for a significant number of
end-users or where there are no other means of transmission for specified television broadcast channels. ‘Must carry’
obligations can include the transmission of services specifically designed to enable equivalent access by end-users
with disabilities. Accordingly complementary services include services designed to improve accessibility for endusers with disabilities, such as videotext, subtitling for end-users who are deaf or hard of hearing, audio description,
spoken subtitles and sign language interpretation, and could include access to the related raw-data where necessary.
In light of the growing provision and reception of connected television services and the continued importance of
EPGs for end-user choice the transmission of programme-related data necessary to support connected television and
EPG functionalities can be included in ‘must carry’ obligations. It should be possible for such programme-related
data to include information about the programme content and how to access it, but not the programme content
itself.

(311) Calling line identification facilities are normally available on modern telephone exchanges and can therefore

increasingly be provided at little or no expense. Member States are not required to impose obligations to provide
these facilities when they are already available. Directive 2002/58/EC safeguards the privacy of users with regard to
itemised billing, by giving them the means to protect their right to privacy when calling line identification is
implemented. The development of those services on a pan-European basis would benefit consumers and is
encouraged by this Directive. A common practice by providers of internet access services is to provide customers
with an e-mail address using their commercial name or trade mark. In order to ensure end-users do not suffer lock-in
effects related to the risk of losing access to e-mails when changing internet access services, Member States should be
able to impose obligations on providers of such services, on request, either to provide access to their e-mails, or to
transfer e-mails sent to the relevant e-mail account(s). The facility should be provided free of charge and for a
duration that is considered to be appropriate by the national regulatory authority.

(312) The publication of information by Member States will ensure that market players and potential market entrants

understand their rights and obligations, and know where to find the relevant detailed information. Publication in the
national gazette helps interested parties in other Member States to find the relevant information.

L 321/96

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(313) In order to ensure that the pan-European electronic communications market is effective and efficient, the

Commission should monitor and publish information on charges which contribute to determining prices to endusers.

(314) In order to determine the correct application of Union law, the Commission needs to know which undertakings have

been designated as having significant market power and which obligations have been placed upon market players by
national regulatory authorities. In addition to publication of that information at national level, it is therefore
necessary for Member States to submit that information to the Commission. Where Member States are required to
send information to the Commission, they should be able to do so by electronic means, subject to agreement on
appropriate authentication procedures.

(315) In order to take account of market, social and technological developments, including evolution of technical

standards, to manage the risks posed to security of networks and services and to ensure effective access to emergency
services through emergency communications, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should
be delegated to the Commission in respect of setting a single maximum Union-wide voice termination rate in fixed
and mobile markets; adopting measures related to emergency communications in the Union; and adapting the
annexes to this Directive. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations
during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with
the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (1). In
particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the
Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have
access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(316) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be

conferred on the Commission to adopt decisions to resolve cross-border harmful interference between
Member States; to identify a harmonised or coordinated approach for the purpose of addressing inconsistent
implementation of general regulatory approaches by national regulatory authorities on the regulation of electronic
communications markets, as well as numbering, including number ranges, portability of numbers and identifiers,
number and address translation systems, and access to emergency services through the single European emergency
number ‘112’; to make the implementation of standards or specifications compulsory, or remove standards or
specifications from the compulsory part of the list of standards; to adopt the technical and organisational measures
to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services, as well as the circumstances, format
and procedures applicable to notification of security incidents; to specify relevant details relating to tradable
individual rights publicly available in a standardised electronic format when the rights of use for radio spectrum are
created to specify the physical and technical characteristics of small-area wireless access points; to authorise or
prevent a national regulatory authority from imposing on undertakings designated as having significant market
power certain obligations for access or interconnection; to harmonise specific numbers or numbering ranges to
address unmet cross-border or pan-European demand for numbering resources; and to specify the contract
summary template to be provided to consumers. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation
(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2).

(317) Finally, the Commission should be able to adopt, as necessary, having taken utmost account of the opinion of

BEREC, recommendations in relation to the identification of the relevant product and service markets, the
notifications under the procedure for consolidating the internal market and the harmonised application of the
provisions of the regulatory framework.

(318) The Commission should review the functioning of this Directive periodically, in particular with a view to

determining the need for amendments in light of changing technological or market conditions.

(1)
(2)

OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.

general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers
(OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13).

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/97

(319) In carrying out its review of the functioning of this Directive, the Commission should assess whether, in light of

developments in the market and with regard to both competition and consumer protection, there is a continued
need for the provisions on sector-specific ex ante regulation or whether those provisions should be amended or
repealed. As this Directive introduces novel approaches to the regulation of electronic communications sectors, such
as the possibility to extend the application of symmetric obligations beyond the first concentration or distribution
point and the regulatory treatment of co-investments, a particular regard should be given in assessing their
functioning.

(320) Future technological and market developments, in particular changes in the use of different electronic

communications services and their ability to ensure effective access to emergency services, might jeopardise the
achievement of the objectives of this Directive on end-users’ rights. BEREC should therefore monitor those
developments in Member States and regularly publish an opinion including an assessment of the impact of such
developments on the application in practice of the provisions of this Directive relating to end-users. The
Commission, taking outmost account of BEREC’s opinion, should publish a report and submit a legislative proposal
where it considers it to be necessary to ensure that the objectives of this Directive are achieved.

(321) Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC, 2002/22/EC and Article 5 of Decision No 243/2012/EU should

be repealed.

(322) The Commission should monitor the transition from the existing framework to the new framework.

(323) Since the objective of this Directive, namely achieving a harmonised and simplified framework for the regulation of

electronic communications networks, electronic communications services, associated facilities and associated
services, of the conditions for the authorisation of networks and services, of radio spectrum use and of numbering
resources, of access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and of
end-user protection cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and
effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the
principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of
proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that
objective.

(324) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on

explanatory documents (1), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their
transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a
directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the
legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.

(325) The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a

substantive amendment as compared to the repealed Directives. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are
unchanged arises under the repealed Directives.

(326) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for the

transposition into national law and the dates of application of the Directives set out in Annex XII, Part B,

Objectives

Article 3
General objectives

1.
Member States shall ensure that in carrying out the regulatory tasks specified in this Directive, the national regulatory
and other competent authorities take all reasonable measures which are necessary and proportionate for achieving the
objectives set out in paragraph 2. Member States, the Commission, the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (‘RSPG’), and BEREC
shall also contribute to the achievement of those objectives.

National regulatory and other competent authorities shall contribute within their competence to ensuring the
implementation of policies aimed at the promotion of freedom of expression and information, cultural and linguistic
diversity, as well as media pluralism.

2.
In the context of this Directive, the national regulatory and other competent authorities as well as BEREC, the
Commission and the Member States shall pursue each of the following general objectives, which are not listed in order of
priority:

(a) promote connectivity and access to, and take-up of, very high capacity networks, including fixed, mobile and wireless
networks, by all citizens and businesses of the Union;

(b) promote competition in the provision of electronic communications networks and associated facilities, including
efficient infrastructure-based competition, and in the provision of electronic communications services and associated
services;

(c) contribute to the development of the internal market by removing remaining obstacles to, and facilitating convergent
conditions for, investment in, and the provision of, electronic communications networks, electronic communications
services, associated facilities and associated services, throughout the Union, by developing common rules and
predictable regulatory approaches, by favouring the effective, efficient and coordinated use of radio spectrum, open
innovation, the establishment and development of trans-European networks, the provision, availability and
interoperability of pan-European services, and end-to-end connectivity;

(d) promote the interests of the citizens of the Union, by ensuring connectivity and the widespread availability and take-up
of very high capacity networks, including fixed, mobile and wireless networks, and of electronic communications
services, by enabling maximum benefits in terms of choice, price and quality on the basis of effective competition, by
maintaining the security of networks and services, by ensuring a high and common level of protection for end-users

Section 1
General part

Article 12
General authorisation of electronic communications networks and services
1.
Member States shall ensure the freedom to provide electronic communications networks and services, subject to the
conditions set out in this Directive. To this end, Member States shall not prevent an undertaking from providing electronic
communications networks or services, except where this is necessary for the reasons set out in Article 52(1) TFEU. Any
such limitation to the freedom to provide electronic communications networks and services shall be duly reasoned and
shall be notified to the Commission.
2.
The provision of electronic communications networks or services, other than number-independent interpersonal
communications services, may, without prejudice to the specific obligations referred to in Article 13(2) or rights of use
referred to in Articles 46 and 94, be subject only to a general authorisation.
3.
Where a Member State considers that a notification requirement is justified for undertakings subject to a general
authorisation, that Member State may require such undertakings only to submit a notification to the national regulatory or
other competent authority. The Member State shall not require such undertakings to obtain an explicit decision or any other
administrative act by such authority or by any other authority before exercising the rights derived from the general
authorisation.
Upon notification, when required, an undertaking may start the activity, where necessary subject to the provisions on the
rights of use under this Directive.
4.
The notification referred to in paragraph 3 shall not entail more than a declaration by a natural or legal person to the
national regulatory or other competent authority of the intention to start the provision of electronic communications
networks or services and the submission of the minimal information which is required to allow BEREC and that authority
to keep a register or list of providers of electronic communications networks and services. That information shall be limited
to:
(a) the name of the provider;
(b) the provider’s legal status, form and registration number, where the provider is registered in a trade or other similar
public register in the Union;
(c) the geographical address of the provider’s main establishment in the Union, if any, and, where applicable, any secondary
branch in a Member State;
(d) the provider’s website address, where applicable, associated with the provision of electronic communications networks
or services;
(e) a contact person and contact details;
(f) a short description of the networks or services intended to be provided;

conditions shall ensure the effective and efficient use thereof and be in accordance with Articles 45 and 51, and, in the case
of rights of use for numbering resources, shall be in accordance with Article 94.

2.
Specific obligations which may be imposed on undertakings providing electronic communications networks and
services under Article 61(1) and (5) and Articles 62, 68 and 83 or on those designated to provide universal service under
this Directive shall be legally separate from the rights and obligations under the general authorisation. In order to achieve
transparency, the criteria and procedures for imposing such specific obligations on individual undertakings shall be referred
to in the general authorisation.

3.
The general authorisation shall contain only conditions which are specific for that sector and are set out in Parts A, B
and C of Annex I and shall not duplicate conditions which are applicable to undertakings by virtue of other national law.

radio spectrum or for numbering resources.

Article 14
Declarations to facilitate the exercise of rights to install facilities and rights of interconnection

Competent authorities shall, within one week of the request of an undertaking, issue standardised declarations confirming,
where applicable, that the undertaking has submitted a notification under Article 12(3). Those declarations shall detail the
circumstances under which any undertaking providing electronic communications networks or services under the general
authorisation has the right to apply for rights to install facilities, negotiate interconnection, and obtain access or
interconnection, in order to facilitate the exercise of those rights, for instance at other levels of government or in relation to
other undertakings. Where appropriate, such declarations may also be issued as an automatic reply following the

spectrum or for numbering resources without the consent of the holder of the rights shall be subject to consultation of the
interested parties in accordance with Article 23.

CHAPTER III

Provision of information, surveys and consultation mechanism

Article 20
Information request to undertakings

1.
Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services, associated
facilities, or associated services, provide all the information, including financial information, necessary for national
regulatory authorities, other competent authorities and BEREC to ensure conformity with the provisions of, or decisions or
opinions adopted in accordance with, this Directive and Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (1). In particular, national regulatory authorities and, where necessary for performing their tasks, other competent
authorities shall have the power to require those undertakings to submit information concerning future network or service
developments that could have an impact on the wholesale services that they make available to competitors, as well as
information on electronic communications networks and associated facilities, which is disaggregated at local level and
sufficiently detailed to enable the geographical survey and designation of areas in accordance with Article 22.

Where the information collected in accordance with the first subparagraph is insufficient for national regulatory authorities,
other competent authorities and BEREC to carry out their regulatory tasks under Union law, such information may be
inquired from other relevant undertakings active in the electronic communications or closely related sectors.

Undertakings designated as having significant market power on wholesale markets may also be required to submit
accounting data on the retail markets that are associated with those wholesale markets.

(1)

Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the Body of

required.

2.
Member States shall ensure that national regulatory and other competent authorities provide the Commission, after a
reasoned request, with the information necessary for it to carry out its tasks under the TFEU. The information requested by
the Commission shall be proportionate to the performance of those tasks. Where the information provided refers to
information previously provided by undertakings at the request of the authority, such undertakings shall be informed
thereof. To the extent necessary, and unless the authority that provides the information has made an explicit and reasoned
request to the contrary, the Commission shall make the information provided available to another such authority in another
Member State.

Subject to the requirements of paragraph 3, Member States shall ensure that the information submitted to one authority can
be made available to another such authority in the same or different Member State and to BEREC, after a substantiated
request, where necessary to allow either authority, or BEREC, to fulfil its responsibilities under Union law.

3.
Where information gathered pursuant to paragraph 1, including information gathered in the context of a
geographical survey, is considered to be confidential by a national regulatory or other competent authority in accordance
with Union and national rules on commercial confidentiality, the Commission, BEREC and any other competent authorities
concerned shall ensure such confidentiality. Such confidentiality shall not prevent the sharing of information between the
competent authority, the Commission, BEREC and any other competent authorities concerned in a timely manner for the
purposes of reviewing, monitoring and supervising the application of this Directive.

4.
Member States shall ensure that, acting in accordance with national rules on public access to information and subject
to Union and national rules on commercial confidentiality and protection of personal data, national regulatory and other
competent authorities publish information that contributes to an open and competitive market.

5.
National regulatory and other competent authorities shall publish the terms of public access to information as
referred to in paragraph 4, including the procedures for obtaining such access.

Where national regulatory or other competent authorities require undertakings to provide information as referred to
in paragraph 1, they shall inform them of the specific purpose for which this information is to be used.

4.
National regulatory or other competent authorities shall not duplicate requests of information already made by
BEREC pursuant to Article 40 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 where BEREC has made the information received available to
those authorities.

Article 22
Geographical surveys of network deployments

1.
National regulatory and/or other competent authorities shall conduct a geographical survey of the reach of electronic
communications networks capable of delivering broadband (‘broadband networks’) by 21 December 2023 and shall update
it at least every three years thereafter.

The geographical survey shall include a survey of the current geographic reach of broadband networks within their
territory, as required for the tasks of national regulatory and/or other competent authorities under this Directive and for the
surveys required for the application of State aid rules.

broadband networks, including very high capacity networks, within their territory.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/115

Such forecast shall include all relevant information, including information on planned deployments by any undertaking or
public authority, of very high capacity networks and significant upgrades or extensions of networks to at least 100 Mbps
download speeds. For this purpose, national regulatory and/or other competent authorities shall request undertakings and
public authorities to provide such information to the extent that it is available and can be provided with reasonable effort.

The national regulatory authority shall decide, with respect to tasks specifically attributed to it under this Directive, the
extent to which it is appropriate to rely on all or part of the information gathered in the context of such forecast.

Where a geographical survey is not conducted by the national regulatory authority, it shall be done in cooperation with that
authority to the extent it may be relevant for its tasks.

The information collected in the geographical survey shall be at an appropriate level of local detail and shall include
sufficient information on the quality of service and parameters thereof and shall be treated in accordance with Article 20(3).

2.
National regulatory and/or other competent authorities may designate an area with clear territorial boundaries where,
on the basis of the information gathered and any forecast prepared pursuant to paragraph 1, it is determined that, for the
duration of the relevant forecast period, no undertaking or public authority has deployed or is planning to deploy a very
high capacity network or significantly upgrade or extend its network to a performance of at least 100 Mbps download
speeds. National regulatory and/or other competent authorities shall publish the designated areas.

3.
Within a designated area, the relevant authorities may invite undertakings and public authorities to declare their
intention to deploy very high capacity networks over the duration of the relevant forecast period. Where this invitation
results in a declaration by an undertaking or public authority of its intention to do so, the relevant authority may require
other undertakings and public authorities to declare any intention to deploy very high capacity networks, or significantly
upgrade or extend its network to a performance of at least 100 Mbps download speeds in this area. The relevant authority
shall specify the information to be included in such submissions, in order to ensure at least a similar level of detail as that

general authorisation or of rights of use for radio spectrum and for numbering resources, or with the specific obligations
referred to in Article 13(2), it shall notify the undertaking of those findings and give the undertaking the opportunity to
state its views, within a reasonable time limit.

3.
The competent authority shall have the power to require the cessation of the breach referred to in paragraph 2 either
immediately or within a reasonable time limit and shall take appropriate and proportionate measures aimed at ensuring
compliance.

In this regard, Member States shall empower the competent authorities to impose:

(a) where appropriate, dissuasive financial penalties which may include periodic penalties with retroactive effect; and

(b) orders to cease or delay provision of a service or bundle of services which, if continued, would result in significant harm
to competition, pending compliance with access obligations imposed following a market analysis carried out in
accordance with Article 67.

general authorisation, of the rights of use for radio spectrum and for numbering resources, or of the specific obligations
referred to in Article 13(2) or Article 47(1) or (2) which represents an immediate and serious threat to public safety, public
security or public health or risks creating serious economic or operational problems for other providers or users of
electronic communications networks or services or other users of the radio spectrum. The competent authority shall give
the undertaking concerned a reasonable opportunity to state its views and propose any remedies. Where appropriate, the
competent authority may confirm the interim measures, which shall be valid for a maximum of three months, but which
may, in circumstances where enforcement procedures have not been completed, be extended for a further period of up to
three months.

7.
Undertakings shall have the right to appeal against measures taken under this Article in accordance with the
procedure referred to in Article 31.

Article 31
Right of appeal

Member States shall ensure that effective mechanisms exist at national level under which any user or undertaking
providing electronic communications networks or services or associated facilities who is affected by a decision of a
competent authority has the right of appeal against that decision to an appeal body that is independent of the parties
involved and of any external intervention or political pressure liable to jeopardise its independent assessment of matters
coming before it. This body, which may be a court, shall have the appropriate expertise to enable it to carry out its functions
effectively. Member States shall ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account.

Pending the outcome of the appeal, the decision of the competent authority shall stand, unless interim measures are granted
in accordance with national law.

2.
Where the appeal body referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is not judicial in character, it shall always give written
reasons for its decision. Furthermore, in such a case, its decision shall be subject to review by a court or a tribunal within
the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.

Member States shall ensure that the appeal mechanism is effective.

3.
Member States shall collect information on the general subject matter of appeals, the number of requests for appeal,
the duration of the appeal proceedings and the number of decisions to grant interim measures. Member States shall provide

before the assignment or renewal of such rights, clearly establish any such conditions, including the level of use required
and the possibility to fulfil that requirement through trading or leasing, in order to ensure the implementation of those
conditions in accordance with Article 30. Conditions attached to renewals of right of use for radio spectrum shall not
provide undue advantages to existing holders of those rights.

Such conditions shall specify the applicable parameters, including any deadline for exercising the rights of use, the nonfulfilment of which would entitle the competent authority to withdraw the right of use or impose other measures.

Competent authorities shall, in a timely and transparent manner, consult and inform interested parties regarding conditions
attached to individual rights of use before their imposition. They shall determine in advance and inform interested parties,
in a transparent manner, of the criteria for the assessment of the fulfilment of those conditions.

At the latest two years before the expiry of the initial duration of an individual right of use, the competent authority shall
conduct an objective and forward-looking assessment of the general criteria laid down for extension of the duration of that
right of use in light of point (c) of Article 45(2). Provided that the competent authority has not initiated enforcement action
for non-compliance with the conditions of the rights of use pursuant to Article 30, it shall grant the extension of the
duration of the right of use unless it concludes that such an extension would not comply with the general criteria laid down
in point (a) or (b) of the third subparagraph of this paragraph.
On the basis of that assessment, the competent authority shall notify the holder of the right as to whether the extension of
the duration of the right of use is to be granted.
If such extension is not to be granted, the competent authority shall apply Article 48 for granting rights of use for that
specific radio spectrum band.
Any measure under this paragraph shall be proportionate, non-discriminatory, transparent and reasoned.
By way of derogation from Article 23, interested parties shall have the opportunity to comment on any draft measure
pursuant to the third and the fourth subparagraphs of this paragraph for a period of at least three months.
This paragraph is without prejudice to the application of Articles 19 and 30.
When establishing fees for rights of use, Member States shall take account of the mechanism provided for under this
paragraph.
3.

Where duly justified, Member States may derogate from paragraph 2 of this Article in the following cases:

(a) in limited geographical areas, where access to high-speed networks is severely deficient or absent and this is necessary to
ensure achievement of the objectives of Article 45(2);
(b) for specific short-term projects;
(c) for experimental use;

L 321/138

(d) for uses of radio spectrum which, in accordance with Article 45(4) and (5), can coexist with wireless broadband
services; or
(e) for alternative use of radio spectrum in accordance with Article 45(3).
4.
Member States may adjust the duration of rights of use laid down in this Article to ensure the simultaneous expiry of
the duration of rights in one or several bands.
Article 50
Renewal of individual rights of use for harmonised radio spectrum
1.
National regulatory or other competent authorities shall take a decision on the renewal of individual rights of use for
harmonised radio spectrum in a timely manner before the duration of those rights expired, except where, at the time of
assignment, the possibility of renewal has been explicitly excluded. For that purpose, those authorities shall assess the need
for such renewal at their own initiative or upon request by the holder of the right, in the latter case not earlier than
five years prior to expiry of the duration of the rights concerned. This shall be without prejudice to renewal clauses
applicable to existing rights.
2.

In taking a decision pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, competent authorities shall consider, inter alia:

(a) the fulfilment of the objectives set out in Article 3, Article 45(2) and Article 48(2), as well as public policy objectives
under Union or national law;
(b) the implementation of a technical implementing measure adopted in accordance with Article 4 of Decision No 676/
2002/EC;
(c) the review of the appropriate implementation of the conditions attached to the right concerned;
(d) the need to promote, or avoid any distortion of, competition in line with Article 52;
(e) the need to render the use of radio spectrum more efficient in light of technological or market evolution;
(f) the need to avoid severe service disruption.
3.
When considering possible renewal of individual rights of use for harmonised radio spectrum for which the number
of rights of use is limited pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, competent authorities shall conduct an open, transparent
and non-discriminatory procedure, and shall, inter alia:
(a) give all interested parties the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation in accordance with
Article 23; and
(b) clearly state the reasons for such possible renewal.
The national regulatory or other competent authority shall take into account any evidence arising from the consultation
pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph of market demand from undertakings other than those holding rights
of use for radio spectrum in the band concerned when deciding whether to renew the rights of use or to organise a new
selection procedure in order to grant the rights of use pursuant to Article 55.
4.
A decision to renew the individual rights of use for harmonised radio spectrum may be accompanied by a review of
the fees as well as of the other terms and conditions attached thereto. Where appropriate, national regulatory or other
competent authorities may adjust the fees for the rights of use in accordance with Article 42.

Article 51
Transfer or lease of individual rights of use for radio spectrum
1.
Member States shall ensure that undertakings may transfer or lease to other undertakings individual rights of use for
radio spectrum.
Member States may determine that this paragraph does not apply where the undertaking’s individual right of use for radio
spectrum was initially granted free of charge or assigned for broadcasting.
2.
Member States shall ensure that an undertaking’s intention to transfer or lease rights of use for radio spectrum, as well
as the effective transfer thereof is notified in accordance with national procedures to the competent authority and is made
public. In the case of harmonised radio spectrum, any such transfer shall comply with such harmonised use.
3.
Member States shall allow the transfer or lease of rights of use for radio spectrum where the original conditions
attached to the rights of use are maintained. Without prejudice to the need to ensure the absence of a distortion of
competition, in particular in accordance with Article 52, Member States shall:
(a) submit transfers and leases to the least onerous procedure possible;
(b) not refuse the lease of rights of use for radio spectrum where the lessor undertakes to remain liable for meeting the
original conditions attached to the rights of use;
(c) not refuse the transfer of rights of use for radio spectrum unless there is a clear risk that the new holder is unable to
meet the original conditions for the right of use.
Any administrative charge imposed on undertakings in connection with processing an application for the transfer or lease
of rights of use for radio spectrum shall comply with Article 16.
Points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph are without prejudice to the Member States’ competence to enforce
compliance with the conditions attached to the rights of use at any time, both with regard to the lessor and the lessee, in
accordance with their national law.
Competent authorities shall facilitate the transfer or lease of rights of use for radio spectrum by giving consideration to any
request to adapt the conditions attached to the rights in a timely manner and by ensuring that those rights or the relevant
radio spectrum may to the best extent be partitioned or disaggregated.
In light of any transfer or lease of rights of use for radio spectrum, competent authorities shall make relevant details relating
to tradable individual rights publicly available in a standardised electronic format when the rights are created and keep
those details for as long as the rights exist.
The Commission may adopt implementing acts specifying those relevant details.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 118(4).
Article 52
Competition
1.
National regulatory and other competent authorities shall promote effective competition and avoid distortions of
competition in the internal market when deciding to grant, amend or renew rights of use for radio spectrum for electronic
communications networks and services in accordance with this Directive.

2.
When Member States grant, amend or renew rights of use for radio spectrum, their national regulatory or other
competent authorities upon the advice provided by national regulatory authority may take appropriate measures such as:

(a) limiting the amount of radio spectrum bands for which rights of use are granted to any undertaking, or, in justified
circumstances, attaching conditions to such rights of use, such as the provision of wholesale access, national or regional
roaming, in certain bands or in certain groups of bands with similar characteristics;

(b) reserving, if appropriate and justified with regard to a specific situation in the national market, a certain part of a radio
spectrum band or group of bands for assignment to new entrants;

(c) refusing to grant new rights of use for radio spectrum or to allow new radio spectrum uses in certain bands, or
attaching conditions to the grant of new rights of use for radio spectrum or to the authorisation of new uses of radio
spectrum, in order to avoid the distortion of competition by any assignment, transfer or accumulation of rights of use;

(d) including conditions prohibiting, or imposing conditions on, transfers of rights of use for radio spectrum, not subject to
Union or national merger control, where such transfers are likely to result in significant harm to competition;

(e) amending the existing rights in accordance with this Directive where this is necessary to remedy ex post a distortion of
competition by any transfer or accumulation of rights of use for radio spectrum.

National regulatory and other competent authorities shall, taking into account market conditions and available
benchmarks, base their decisions on an objective and forward-looking assessment of the market competitive conditions, of
whether such measures are necessary to maintain or achieve effective competition, and of the likely effects of such measures
on existing and future investments by market participants in particular for network roll-out. In doing so, they shall take into
account the approach to market analysis as set out in Article 67(2).

3.
When applying paragraph 2 of this Article, national regulatory and other competent authorities shall act in
accordance with the procedures provided in Articles 18, 19, 23 and 35.

Section 3
Procedures

Article 53
Coordinated timing of assignments

1.
Member States shall cooperate in order to coordinate the use of harmonised radio spectrum for electronic
communications networks and services in the Union taking due account of the different national market situations. This
may include identifying one, or, where appropriate, several common dates by which the use of specific harmonised radio
spectrum is to be authorised.

2.
Where harmonised conditions have been set by technical implementing measures in accordance with Decision
No 676/2002/EC in order to enable the radio spectrum use for wireless broadband networks and services, Member States
shall allow the use of that radio spectrum, as soon as possible and at the latest 30 months after the adoption of that
measure, or as soon as possible after the lifting of any decision to allow alternative use on an exceptional basis pursuant to
Article 45(3) of this Directive. This is without prejudice to Decision (EU) 2017/899 and to the Commission’s right of
initiative to propose legislative acts.

3.
A Member State may delay the deadline provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article for a specific band under the
following circumstances:
(a) to the extent justified by a restriction to the use of that band based on the general interest objective provided in point (a)
or (d) of Article 45(5);
(b) in the case of unresolved cross-border coordination issues resulting in harmful interference with third countries,
provided the affected Member State has, where appropriate, requested Union assistance pursuant to Article 28(5);
(c) safeguarding national security and defence; or
(d) force majeure.
The Member State concerned shall review such a delay at least every two years.
4.
A Member State may delay the deadline provided for in paragraph 2 for a specific band to the extent necessary and up
to 30 months in the case of:
(a) unresolved cross-border coordination issues resulting in harmful interference between Member States, provided that the
affected Member State takes all necessary measures in a timely manner pursuant to Article 28(3) and (4);
(b) the need to ensure, and the complexity of ensuring, the technical migration of existing users of that band.
5.
In the event of a delay under paragraph 3 or 4, the Member State concerned shall inform the other Member States and
the Commission in a timely manner, stating the reasons.
Article 54
Coordinated timing of assignments for specific 5G bands
1.
By 31 December 2020, for terrestrial systems capable of providing wireless broadband services, Member States shall,
where necessary in order to facilitate the roll-out of 5G, take all appropriate measures to:
(a) reorganise and allow the use of sufficiently large blocks of the 3,4-3,8 GHz band;
(b) allow the use of at least 1 GHz of the 24,25-27,5 GHz band, provided that there is clear evidence of market demand and
of the absence of significant constraints for migration of existing users or band clearance.
2.
Member States may, however, extend the deadline laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article, where justified, in
accordance with Article 45(3) or Article 53(2), (3) or (4).
3.
Measures taken pursuant paragraph 1 of this Article shall comply with the harmonised conditions set by technical
implementing measures in accordance with Article 4 of Decision No 676/2002/EC.
Article 55
Procedure for limiting the number of rights of use to be granted for radio spectrum
1.
Without prejudice to Article 53, where a Member State concludes that a right to use radio spectrum cannot be subject
to a general authorisation and where it considers whether to limit the number of rights of use to be granted for radio
spectrum, it shall, inter alia:
(a) clearly state the reasons for limiting the rights of use, in particular by giving due weight to the need to maximise benefits
for users and to facilitate the development of competition, and review, as appropriate, the limitation at regular intervals
or at the reasonable request of affected undertakings;

L 321/142

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(b) give all interested parties, including users and consumers, the opportunity to express their views on any limitation
through a public consultation in accordance with Article 23.

2.
When a Member State concludes that the number of rights of use is to be limited, it shall clearly establish, and give
reasons for, the objectives pursued by means of a competitive or comparative selection procedure under this Article, and
where possible quantify them, giving due weight to the need to fulfil national and internal market objectives. The objectives
that the Member State may set out with a view to designing the specific selection procedure shall, in addition to promoting
competition, be limited to one or more of the following:

(a) promoting coverage;

(b) ensuring the required quality of service;

(c) promoting efficient use of radio spectrum, including by taking into account the conditions attached to the rights of use
and the level of fees;

(d) promoting innovation and business development.

The national regulatory or other competent authority shall clearly define and justify the choice of the selection procedure,
including any preliminary phase to access the selection procedure. It shall also clearly state the outcome of any related
assessment of the competitive, technical and economic situation of the market and provide reasons for the possible use and
choice of measures pursuant to Article 35.

3.
Member States shall publish any decision on the selection procedure chosen and the related rules, clearly stating the
reasons therefor. It shall also publish the conditions that are to be attached to the rights of use.

4.

After having determined the selection procedure, the Member State shall invite applications for rights of use.

5.
Where a Member State concludes that additional rights of use for radio spectrum or a combination of general
authorisation and individual rights of use can be granted, it shall publish that conclusion and initiate the process of granting
such rights.

6.
Where the granting of rights of use for radio spectrum needs to be limited, Member States shall grant such rights on
the basis of selection criteria and a selection procedure which are objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and
proportionate. Any such selection criteria shall give due weight to the achievement of the objectives and requirements of
Articles 3, 4, 28 and 45.

7.
Where competitive or comparative selection procedures are to be used, Member States may extend the maximum
period of six weeks referred to in Article 48(6) for as long as necessary to ensure that such procedures are fair, reasonable,
open and transparent to all interested parties, but by no longer than eight months, subject to any specific timetable
established pursuant to Article 53.

Those time limits shall be without prejudice to any applicable international agreements relating to the use of radio spectrum
and satellite coordination.

8.

This Article is without prejudice to the transfer of rights of use for radio spectrum in accordance with Article 51.

Competent authorities shall allow the provision of access through RLANs to a public electronic communications
network, as well as the use of the harmonised radio spectrum for that provision, subject only to applicable general
authorisation conditions relating to radio spectrum use as referred to in Article 46(1).
Where that provision is not part of an economic activity or is ancillary to an economic activity or a public service which is
not dependent on the conveyance of signals on those networks, any undertaking, public authority or end-user providing
such access shall not be subject to any general authorisation for the provision of electronic communications networks or
services pursuant to Article 12, to obligations regarding end-users rights pursuant to Title II of Part III, or to obligations to
interconnect their networks pursuant to Article 61(1).
2.

Article 12 of Directive 2000/31/EC shall apply.

3.
Competent authorities shall not prevent providers of public electronic communications networks or publicly available
electronic communications services from allowing access to their networks to the public, through RLANs, which may be
located at an end-user’s premises, subject to compliance with the applicable general authorisation conditions and the prior
informed agreement of the end-user.
4.
In accordance in particular with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, competent authorities shall ensure that
providers of public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services do not
unilaterally restrict or prevent end-users from:
(a) accessing RLANs of their choice provided by third parties; or
(b) allowing reciprocally or, more generally, accessing the networks of such providers by other end-users through RLANs,
including on the basis of third-party initiatives which aggregate and make publicly accessible the RLANs of different
end-users.
5.
Competent authorities shall not limit or prevent end-users from allowing access, reciprocally or otherwise, to their
RLANs by other end-users, including on the basis of third-party initiatives which aggregate and make the RLANs of
different end-users publicly accessible.
6.

Competent authorities shall not unduly restrict the provision of access to RLANs to the public:

(a) by public sector bodies or in public spaces close to premises occupied by such public sector bodies, when that provision
is ancillary to the public services provided on those premises;
(b) by initiatives of non-governmental organisations or public sector bodies to aggregate and make reciprocally or more
generally accessible the RLANs of different end-users, including, where applicable, the RLANs to which public access is
provided in accordance with point (a).
Article 57
Deployment and operation of small-area wireless access points
1.
Competent authorities shall not unduly restrict the deployment of small-area wireless access points. Member States
shall seek to ensure that any rules governing the deployment of small-area wireless access points are nationally consistent.
Such rules shall be published in advance of their application.

L 321/144

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

In particular, competent authorities shall not subject the deployment of small-area wireless access points complying with
the characteristics laid down pursuant to paragraph 2 to any individual town planning permit or other individual prior
permits.
By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of this paragraph, competent authorities may require permits for the
deployment of small-area wireless access points on buildings or sites of architectural, historical or natural value protected in
accordance with national law or where necessary for public safety reasons. Article 7 of Directive 2014/61/EU shall apply to
the granting of those permits.
2.
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, specify the physical and technical characteristics, such as
maximum size, weight, and where appropriate emission power of small-area wireless access points.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 118(4).
The first such implementing act shall be adopted by 30 June 2020.
3.
This Article is without prejudice to the essential requirements laid down in Directive 2014/53/EU and to the
authorisation regime applicable for the use of the relevant radio spectrum.
4.
Member States shall, by applying, where relevant, the procedures adopted in accordance with Directive 2014/61/EU,
ensure that operators have the right to access any physical infrastructure controlled by national, regional or local public
authorities, which is technically suitable to host small-area wireless access points or which is necessary to connect such
access points to a backbone network, including street furniture, such as light poles, street signs, traffic lights, billboards, bus
and tramway stops and metro stations. Public authorities shall meet all reasonable requests for access on fair, reasonable,
transparent and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, which shall be made public at a single information point.
5.
Without prejudice to any commercial agreements, the deployment of small-area wireless access points shall not be
subject to any fees or charges going beyond the administrative charges in accordance with Article 16.
Article 58
Technical regulations on electromagnetic fields
The procedures laid down in Directive (EU) 2015/1535 shall apply with respect to any draft measure by a Member State
that would impose on the deployment of small-area wireless access points different requirements with respect to
electromagnetic fields than those provided for in Recommendation 1999/519/EC.

TITLE II
ACCESS

CHAPTER I

General provisions, access principles

Article 59
General framework for access and interconnection
1.
Member States shall ensure that there are no restrictions which prevent undertakings in the same Member State or in
different Member States from negotiating between themselves agreements on technical and commercial arrangements for
access or interconnection, in accordance with Union law. The undertaking requesting access or interconnection does not
need to be authorised to operate in the Member State where access or interconnection is requested, if it is not providing
services and does not operate a network in that Member State.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/145

2.
Without prejudice to Article 114, Member States shall not maintain legal or administrative measures which require
undertakings, when granting access or interconnection, to offer different terms and conditions to different undertakings for
equivalent services or measures imposing obligations that are not related to the actual access and interconnection services
provided without prejudice to the conditions set out in Annex I.

Article 60
Rights and obligations of undertakings

1.
Operators of public electronic communications networks shall have a right and, when requested by other
undertakings so authorised in accordance with Article 15, an obligation to negotiate with each other interconnection for
the purpose of providing publicly available electronic communications services, in order to ensure provision and
interoperability of services throughout the Union. Operators shall offer access and interconnection to other undertakings
on terms and conditions consistent with obligations imposed by the national regulatory authority pursuant to Articles 61,
62 and 68.

2.
Without prejudice to Article 21, Member States shall require that undertakings which acquire information from
another undertaking before, during or after the process of negotiating access or interconnection arrangements use that
information solely for the purpose for which it was supplied and respect at all times the confidentiality of information
transmitted or stored. Such undertakings shall not pass on the received information to any other party, in particular other
departments, subsidiaries or partners, for whom such information could provide a competitive advantage.

3.
Member States may provide for negotiations to be conducted through neutral intermediaries when conditions of
competition so require.

CHAPTER II

Access and interconnection

Article 61
Powers and responsibilities of the national regulatory and other competent authorities with regard to access and
interconnection

1.
National regulatory authorities or other competent authorities in the case of points (b) and (c) of the first
subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article shall, acting in pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 3, encourage and,
where appropriate, ensure, in accordance with this Directive, adequate access and interconnection, and the interoperability
of services, exercising their responsibility in a way that promotes efficiency, sustainable competition, the deployment of
very high capacity networks, efficient investment and innovation, and gives the maximum benefit to end-users.

They shall provide guidance and make publicly available the procedures applicable to gain access and interconnection to
ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises and operators with a limited geographical reach can benefit from the
obligations imposed.

2.
In particular, without prejudice to measures that may be taken regarding undertakings designated as having significant
market power in accordance with Article 68, national regulatory authorities, or other competent authorities in the case of
points (b) and (c) of this subparagraph, shall be able to impose:

(a) to the extent necessary to ensure end-to-end connectivity, obligations on undertakings subject to general authorisation
that control access to end-users, including, in justified cases, the obligation to interconnect their networks where this is
not already the case;

L 321/146

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(b) in justified cases and to the extent necessary, obligations on undertakings subject to general authorisation that control
access to end-users to make their services interoperable;

(c) in justified cases, where end-to-end connectivity between end-users is endangered due to a lack of interoperability
between interpersonal communications services, and to the extent necessary to ensure end-to-end connectivity between
end-users, obligations on relevant providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services which
reach a significant level of coverage and user uptake, to make their services interoperable;

(d) to the extent necessary to ensure accessibility for end-users to digital radio and television broadcasting services and
related complementary services specified by the Member State, obligations on operators to provide access to the other
facilities referred to in Part II of Annex II on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

The obligations referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph shall be imposed only:

(i) to the extent necessary to ensure interoperability of interpersonal communications services and may include
proportionate obligations on providers of those services to publish and allow the use, modification and redistribution of
relevant information by the authorities and other providers, or to use and implement standards or specifications listed
in Article 39(1) or of any other relevant European or international standards;

(ii) where the Commission, after consulting BEREC and taking utmost account of its opinion, has found an appreciable
threat to end-to-end connectivity between end-users throughout the Union or in at least three Member States and has
adopted implementing measures specifying the nature and scope of any obligations that may be imposed.

The implementing measures referred to in point (ii) of the second subparagraph shall be adopted in accordance with the
examination procedure referred to in Article 118(4).

3.
In particular, and without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2, national regulatory authorities may impose obligations,
upon reasonable request, to grant access to wiring and cables and associated facilities inside buildings or up to the first
concentration or distribution point as determined by the national regulatory authority, where that point is located outside
the building. Where it is justified on the grounds that replication of such network elements would be economically
inefficient or physically impracticable, such obligations may be imposed on providers of electronic communications
networks or on the owners of such wiring and cables and associated facilities, where those owners are not providers of
electronic communications networks. The access conditions imposed may include specific rules on access to such network
elements and to associated facilities and associated services, on transparency and non-discrimination and on apportioning
the costs of access, which, where appropriate, are adjusted to take into account risk factors.

Where a national regulatory authority concludes, having regard, where applicable, to the obligations resulting from any
relevant market analysis, that the obligations imposed in accordance with the first subparagraph do not sufficiently address
high and non-transitory economic or physical barriers to replication which underlie an existing or emerging market
situation significantly limiting competitive outcomes for end-users, it may extend the imposition of such access obligations,
on fair and reasonable terms and conditions, beyond the first concentration or distribution point, to a point that it
determines to be the closest to end-users, capable of hosting a sufficient number of end-user connections to be
commercially viable for efficient access seekers. In determining the extent of the extension beyond the first concentration or
distribution point, the national regulatory authority shall take utmost account of relevant BEREC guidelines. If justified on
technical or economic grounds, national regulatory authorities may impose active or virtual access obligations.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/147

National regulatory authorities shall not impose obligations in accordance with the second subparagraph on providers of
electronic communications networks where they determine that:

(a) the provider has the characteristics listed in Article 80(1) and makes available a viable and similar alternative means of
reaching end-users by providing access to a very high capacity network to any undertaking, on fair, non-discriminatory
and reasonable terms and conditions; national regulatory authorities may extend that exemption to other providers
offering, on fair, non-discriminatory and reasonable terms and conditions, access to a very high capacity network; or

(b) the imposition of obligations would compromise the economic or financial viability of a new network deployment, in
particular by small local projects.

By way of derogation from point (a) of the third subparagraph, national regulatory authorities may impose obligations on
providers of electronic communications networks fulfilling the criteria laid down in that point where the network
concerned is publicly funded.

By 21 December 2020, BEREC shall publish guidelines to foster a consistent application of this paragraph, by setting out
the relevant criteria for determining:

(a) the first concentration or distribution point;

(b) the point, beyond the first concentration or distribution point, capable of hosting a sufficient number of end-user
connections to enable an efficient undertaking to overcome the significant replicability barriers identified;

(c) which network deployments can be considered to be new;

(d) which projects can be considered to be small; and

(e) which economic or physical barriers to replication are high and non-transitory.

4.
Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States shall ensure that competent authorities have the power to
impose on undertakings providing or authorised to provide electronic communications networks obligations in relation to
the sharing of passive infrastructure or obligations to conclude localised roaming access agreements, in both cases if directly
necessary for the local provision of services which rely on the use of radio spectrum, in accordance with Union law and
provided that no viable and similar alternative means of access to end-users is made available to any undertaking on fair and
reasonable terms and conditions. Competent authorities may impose such obligations only where this possibility is clearly
provided for when granting the rights of use for radio spectrum and where justified on the grounds that, in the area subject
to such obligations, the market-driven deployment of infrastructure for the provision of networks or services which rely on
the use of radio spectrum is subject to insurmountable economic or physical obstacles and therefore access to networks or
services by end-users is severely deficient or absent. In those circumstances where access and sharing of passive
infrastructure alone does not suffice to address the situation, national regulatory authorities may impose obligations on
sharing of active infrastructure.

Competent authorities shall have regard to:

(a) the need to maximise connectivity throughout the Union, along major transport paths and in particular territorial areas,
and to the possibility to significantly increase choice and higher quality of service for end-users;

(b) the efficient use of radio spectrum;

(c) the technical feasibility of sharing and associated conditions;

L 321/148

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(d) the state of infrastructure-based as well as service-based competition;

(e) technological innovation;

(f) the overriding need to support the incentive of the host to roll out the infrastructure in the first place.

In the event of dispute resolution, competent authorities may, inter alia, impose on the beneficiary of the sharing or access
obligation, the obligation to share radio spectrum with the infrastructure host in the relevant area.

5.
Obligations and conditions imposed in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article shall be objective,
transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory, they shall be implemented in accordance with the procedures referred
to in Articles 23, 32 and 33. The national regulatory and other competent authorities which have imposed such obligations
and conditions shall assess the results thereof by five years after the adoption of the previous measure adopted in relation to
the same undertakings and assess whether it would be appropriate to withdraw or amend them in light of evolving
conditions. Those authorities shall notify the outcome of their assessment in accordance with the procedures referred to in
Articles 23, 32 and 33.

6.
For the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, Member States shall ensure that the national regulatory
authority is empowered to intervene on its own initiative where justified in order to secure the policy objectives of
Article 3, in accordance with this Directive and, in particular, with the procedures referred to in Articles 23 and 32.

7.
By 21 June 2020 in order to contribute to a consistent definition of the location of network termination points by
national regulatory authorities, BEREC shall, after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission,
adopt guidelines on common approaches to the identification of the network termination point in different network
topologies. National regulatory authorities shall take utmost account of those guidelines when defining the location of
network termination points.

Article 62
Conditional access systems and other facilities

1.
Member States shall ensure that the conditions laid down in Part I of Annex II apply in relation to conditional access
to digital television and radio services broadcast to viewers and listeners in the Union, irrespective of the means of
transmission.

2.
Where, as a result of a market analysis carried out in accordance with Article 67(1), a national regulatory authority
finds that one or more undertakings do not have significant market power on the relevant market, it may amend or
withdraw the conditions with respect to those undertakings, in accordance with the procedures referred to in Articles 23
and 32, only to the extent that:

(a) accessibility for end-users to radio and television broadcasts and broadcasting channels and services specified in
accordance with Article 114 would not be adversely affected by such amendment or withdrawal; and

(b) the prospects for effective competition in the following markets would not be adversely affected by such amendment or
withdrawal:

(i) retail digital television and radio broadcasting services; and

(ii) conditional access systems and other associated facilities.

An appropriate notice period shall be given to parties affected by such amendment or withdrawal of conditions.

3.
Conditions applied in accordance with this Article are without prejudice to the ability of Member States to impose
obligations in relation to the presentational aspect of EPGs and similar listing and navigation facilities.

4.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States may allow their national regulatory authority, as soon as
possible after 20 December 2018 and periodically thereafter, to review the conditions applied in accordance with this
Article, by undertaking a market analysis in accordance with Article 67(1) to determine whether to maintain, amend or
withdraw the conditions applied.

CHAPTER III

Market analysis and significant market power

Article 63
Undertakings with significant market power

1.
Where this Directive requires national regulatory authorities to determine whether undertakings have significant
market power in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 67, paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply.

2.
An undertaking shall be deemed to have significant market power if, either individually or jointly with others, it
enjoys a position equivalent to dominance, namely a position of economic strength affording it the power to behave to an
appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and ultimately consumers.

In particular, national regulatory authorities shall, when assessing whether two or more undertakings are in a joint
dominant position in a market, act in accordance with Union law and take into the utmost account the guidelines on
market analysis and the assessment of significant market power published by the Commission pursuant to Article 64.

3.
Where an undertaking has significant market power on a specific market, it may also be designated as having
significant market power on a closely related market, where the links between the two markets allow the market power held
on the specific market to be leveraged into the closely related market, thereby strengthening the market power of the
undertaking. Consequently, remedies aiming to prevent such leverage may be applied in the closely related market pursuant
to Articles 69, 70, 71 and 74.

Article 64
Procedure for the identification and definition of markets

1.
After public consultation including with national regulatory authorities and taking the utmost account of the opinion
of BEREC, the Commission shall adopt a Recommendation on Relevant Product and Service Markets (‘the
Recommendation’). The Recommendation shall identify those product and service markets within the electronic
communications sector the characteristics of which may be such as to justify the imposition of regulatory obligations set
out in this Directive, without prejudice to markets that may be defined in specific cases under competition law. The
Commission shall define markets in accordance with the principles of competition law.

The Commission shall include product and service markets in the Recommendation where, after observing overall trends in
the Union, it finds that each of the three criteria listed in Article 67(1) is met.

The Commission shall review the Recommendation by 21 December 2020 and regularly thereafter.

L 321/150

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

2.
After consulting BEREC, the Commission shall publish guidelines for market analysis and the assessment of
significant market power (‘the SMP guidelines’) which shall be in accordance with the relevant principles of competition law.
The SMP guidelines shall include guidance to national regulatory authorities on the application of the concept of significant
market power to the specific context of ex ante regulation of electronic communications markets, taking account of the
three criteria listed in Article 67(1).

3.
National regulatory authorities shall, taking the utmost account of the Recommendation and the SMP guidelines,
define relevant markets appropriate to national circumstances, in particular relevant geographic markets within their
territory by taking into account, inter alia, the degree of infrastructure competition in those areas, in accordance with the
principles of competition law. National regulatory authorities shall, where relevant, also take into account the results of the
geographical survey conducted in accordance with Article 22(1). They shall follow the procedures referred to in Articles 23
and 32 before defining the markets that differ from those identified in the Recommendation.

Article 65
Procedure for the identification of transnational markets

1.
If the Commission or at least two national regulatory authorities concerned submit a reasoned request, including
supporting evidence, BEREC shall conduct an analysis of a potential transnational market. After consulting stakeholders and
taking utmost account of the analysis carried out by BEREC, the Commission may adopt decisions identifying transnational
markets in accordance with the principles of competition law and taking utmost account of the Recommendation and SMP
guidelines adopted in accordance with Article 64.

2.
In the case of transnational markets identified in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the national regulatory
authorities concerned shall jointly conduct the market analysis taking the utmost account of the SMP guidelines and, in a
concerted fashion, shall decide on any imposition, maintenance, amendment or withdrawal of regulatory obligations
referred to in Article 67(4). The national regulatory authorities concerned shall jointly notify to the Commission their draft
measures regarding the market analysis and any regulatory obligations pursuant to Articles 32 and 33.

Two or more national regulatory authorities may also jointly notify their draft measures regarding the market analysis and
any regulatory obligations in the absence of transnational markets, where they consider that market conditions in their
respective jurisdictions are sufficiently homogeneous.

Article 66
Procedure for the identification of transnational demand

1.
BEREC shall conduct an analysis of transnational end-user demand for products and services that are provided within
the Union in one or more of the markets listed in the Recommendation, if it receives a reasoned request providing
supporting evidence from the Commission or from at least two of the national regulatory authorities concerned indicating
that there is a serious demand problem to be addressed. BEREC may also conduct such analysis if it receives a reasoned
request from market participants providing sufficient supporting evidence and considers that there is a serious demand
problem to be addressed. BEREC’s analysis is without prejudice to any findings of transnational markets in accordance with
Article 65(1) and to any findings of national or sub-national geographical markets by national regulatory authorities in
accordance with Article 64(3).

That analysis of transnational end-user demand may include products and services that are supplied within product or
service markets that have been defined in different ways by one or more national regulatory authorities when taking into
account national circumstances, provided that those products and services are substitutable to those supplied in one of the
markets listed in the Recommendation.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/151

2.
If BEREC concludes that a transnational end-user demand exists, is significant and is not sufficiently met by supply
provided on a commercial or regulated basis, it shall, after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the
Commission, issue guidelines on common approaches for national regulatory authorities to meet the identified
transnational demand, including, where appropriate, when they impose remedies in accordance with Article 68. National
regulatory authorities shall take into utmost account those guidelines when performing their regulatory tasks within their
jurisdiction. Those guidelines may provide the basis for interoperability of wholesale access products across the Union and
may include guidance for the harmonisation of technical specifications of wholesale access products capable of meeting
such identified transnational demand.

Article 67
Market analysis procedure

1.
National regulatory authorities shall determine whether a relevant market defined in accordance with Article 64(3) is
such as to justify the imposition of the regulatory obligations set out in this Directive. Member States shall ensure that an
analysis is carried out, where appropriate, in collaboration with the national competition authorities. National regulatory
authorities shall take utmost account of the SMP guidelines and shall follow the procedures referred to in Articles 23 and 32
when conducting such analysis.

A market may be considered to justify the imposition of regulatory obligations set out in this Directive if all of the following
criteria are met:

(a) high and non-transitory structural, legal or regulatory barriers to entry are present;

(b) there is a market structure which does not tend towards effective competition within the relevant time horizon, having
regard to the state of infrastructure-based competition and other sources of competition behind the barriers to entry;

(c) competition law alone is insufficient to adequately address the identified market failure(s).

Where a national regulatory authority conducts an analysis of a market that is included in the Recommendation, it shall
consider that points (a), (b) and (c) of the second subparagraph have been met, unless the national regulatory authority
determines that one or more of such criteria is not met in the specific national circumstances.

2.
Where a national regulatory authority conducts the analysis required by paragraph 1, it shall consider developments
from a forward-looking perspective in the absence of regulation imposed on the basis of this Article in that relevant market,
and taking into account all of the following:

(a) market developments affecting the likelihood of the relevant market tending towards effective competition;

(b) all relevant competitive constraints, at the wholesale and retail levels, irrespective of whether the sources of such
constraints are considered to be electronic communications networks, electronic communications services, or other
types of services or applications which are comparable from the perspective of the end-user, and irrespective of whether
such constraints are part of the relevant market;

(c) other types of regulation or measures imposed and affecting the relevant market or related retail market or markets
throughout the relevant period, including, without limitation, obligations imposed in accordance with Articles 44, 60
and 61;

(d) regulation imposed on other relevant markets on the basis of this Article.

L 321/152

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

3.
Where a national regulatory authority concludes that a relevant market does not justify the imposition of regulatory
obligations in accordance with the procedure in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, or where the conditions set out in
paragraph 4 of this Article are not met, it shall not impose or maintain any specific regulatory obligations in accordance
with Article 68. Where there already are sector specific regulatory obligations imposed in accordance with Article 68, it
shall withdraw such obligations placed on undertakings in that relevant market.

National regulatory authorities shall ensure that parties affected by such a withdrawal of obligations receive an appropriate
notice period, defined by balancing the need to ensure a sustainable transition for the beneficiaries of those obligations and
end-users, end-user choice, and that regulation does not continue for longer than necessary. When setting such a notice
period, national regulatory authorities may determine specific conditions and notice periods in relation to existing access
agreements.

4.
Where a national regulatory authority determines that, in a relevant market the imposition of regulatory obligations
in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article is justified, it shall identify any undertakings which individually or
jointly have a significant market power on that relevant market in accordance with Article 63. The national regulatory
authority shall impose on such undertakings appropriate specific regulatory obligations in accordance with Article 68 or
maintain or amend such obligations where they already exist if it considers that the outcome for end-users would not be
effectively competitive in the absence of those obligations.

5.
Measures taken in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall be subject to the procedures referred to in
Articles 23 and 32. National regulatory authorities shall carry out an analysis of the relevant market and notify the
corresponding draft measure in accordance with Article 32:

(a) within five years from the adoption of a previous measure where the national regulatory authority has defined the
relevant market and determined which undertakings have significant market power; that five-year period may, on an
exceptional basis, be extended for up to one year, where the national regulatory authority has notified a reasoned
proposal for an extension to the Commission no later than four months before the expiry of the five-year period, and
the Commission has not objected within one month of the notified extension;

(b) within three years from the adoption of a revised Recommendation on relevant markets, for markets not previously
notified to the Commission; or

(c) within three years from their accession, for Member States which have newly joined the Union.

6.
Where a national regulatory authority considers that it may not complete or has not completed its analysis of a
relevant market identified in the Recommendation within the time limit laid down in paragraph 5 of this Article, BEREC
shall, upon request, provide assistance to the national regulatory authority concerned in completing the analysis of the
specific market and the specific obligations to be imposed. With this assistance, the national regulatory authority concerned
shall, within six months of the limit laid down in paragraph 5 of this Article, notify the draft measure to the Commission in
accordance with Article 32.

CHAPTER IV

Access remedies imposed on undertakings with significant market power

Article 68
Imposition, amendment or withdrawal of obligations

1.
Member States shall ensure that national regulatory authorities are empowered to impose the obligations set out in
Articles 69 to 74 and Articles 76 to 81.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/153

2.
Where an undertaking is designated as having significant market power on a specific market as a result of a market
analysis carried out in accordance with Article 67, national regulatory authorities shall, as appropriate, impose any of the
obligations set out in Articles 69 to 74 and Articles 76 and 80. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, a
national regulatory authority shall choose the least intrusive way of addressing the problems identified in the market
analysis.

3.
National regulatory authorities shall impose the obligations set out in Articles 69 to 74 and Articles 76 and 80 only
on undertakings that have been designated as having significant market power in accordance with paragraph 2 of this
Article, without prejudice to:

(a) Articles 61 and 62;

(b) Articles 44 and 17 of this Directive, Condition 7 in Part D of Annex I as applied by virtue of Article 13(1) of this
Directive, Articles 97 and 106 of this Directive and the relevant provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC containing
obligations on undertakings other than those designated as having significant market power; or

(c) the need to comply with international commitments.

In exceptional circumstances, where a national regulatory authority intends to impose on undertakings designated as
having significant market power obligations for access or interconnection other than those set out in Articles 69 to 74 and
Articles 76 and 80, it shall submit a request to the Commission.

The Commission shall, taking utmost account of the opinion of BEREC, adopt decisions by means of implementing acts,
authorising or preventing the national regulatory authority from taking such measures.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 118(3).

4.

Obligations imposed in accordance with this Article shall be:

(a) based on the nature of the problem identified by a national regulatory authority in its market analysis, where
appropriate taking into account the identification of transnational demand pursuant to Article 66;

(b) proportionate, having regard, where possible, to the costs and benefits;

(c) justified in light of the objectives laid down in Article 3; and

(d) imposed following consultation in accordance with Articles 23 and 32.

5.
In relation to the need to comply with international commitments referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, national
regulatory authorities shall notify decisions to impose, amend or withdraw obligations on undertakings to the Commission,
in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 32.

6.
National regulatory authorities shall consider the impact of new market developments, such as in relation to
commercial agreements, including co-investment agreements, influencing competitive dynamics.

If those developments are not sufficiently important to require a new market analysis in accordance with Article 67, the
national regulatory authority shall assess without delay whether it is necessary to review the obligations imposed on
undertakings designated as having significant market power and amend any previous decision, including by withdrawing
obligations or imposing new obligations, in order to ensure that such obligations continue to meet the conditions set out in
paragraph 4 of this Article. Such amendments shall be imposed only after consultations in accordance with Articles 23
and 32.

L 321/154

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

Article 69
Obligation of transparency

1.
National regulatory authorities may, in accordance with Article 68, impose obligations of transparency in relation to
interconnection or access, requiring undertakings to make public specific information, such as accounting information,
prices, technical specifications, network characteristics and expected developments thereof, as well as terms and conditions
for supply and use, including any conditions altering access to or use of services and applications, in particular with regard
to migration from legacy infrastructure, where such conditions are allowed by Member States in accordance with Union
law.

2.
In particular, where an undertaking has obligations of non-discrimination, national regulatory authorities may require
that undertaking to publish a reference offer, which shall be sufficiently unbundled to ensure that undertakings are not
required to pay for facilities which are not necessary for the service requested. That offer shall contain a description of the
relevant offerings broken down into components according to market needs, and the associated terms and conditions,
including prices. The national regulatory authority may, inter alia, impose changes to reference offers to give effect to
obligations imposed under this Directive.

3.
National regulatory authorities may specify the precise information to be made available, the level of detail required
and the manner of publication.

4.
By 21 December 2019, in order to contribute to the consistent application of transparency obligations, BEREC shall,
after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, issue guidelines on the minimum criteria for a
reference offer and shall review them where necessary in order to adapt them to technological and market developments. In
providing such minimum criteria, BEREC shall pursue the objectives in Article 3, and shall have regard to the needs of the
beneficiaries of access obligations and of end-users that are active in more than one Member State, as well as to any BEREC
guidelines identifying transnational demand in accordance with Article 66 and to any related decision of the Commission.

Notwithstanding paragraph 3 of this Article, where an undertaking has obligations under Article 72 or 73 concerning
wholesale access to network infrastructure, national regulatory authorities shall ensure the publication of a reference offer
taking utmost account of the BEREC guidelines on the minimum criteria for a reference offer, shall ensure that key
performance indicators are specified, where relevant, as well as corresponding service levels, and closely monitor and
ensure compliance with them. In addition, national regulatory authorities may, where necessary, predetermine the
associated financial penalties in accordance with Union and national law.

Article 70
Obligations of non-discrimination

1.
A national regulatory authority may, in accordance with Article 68, impose obligations of non-discrimination, in
relation to interconnection or access.

2.
Obligations of non-discrimination shall ensure, in particular, that the undertaking applies equivalent conditions in
equivalent circumstances to other providers of equivalent services, and provides services and information to others under
the same conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own services, or those of its subsidiaries or partners.
National regulatory authorities may impose on that undertaking obligations to supply access products and services to all
undertakings, including to itself, on the same timescales, terms and conditions, including those relating to price and service
levels, and by means of the same systems and processes, in order to ensure equivalence of access.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/155

Article 71
Obligation of accounting separation

1.
A national regulatory authority may, in accordance with Article 68, impose obligations for accounting separation in
relation to specified activities related to interconnection or access.

In particular, a national regulatory authority may require a vertically integrated undertaking to make transparent its
wholesale prices and its internal transfer prices, inter alia to ensure compliance where there is an obligation of nondiscrimination under Article 70 or, where necessary, to prevent unfair cross-subsidy. National regulatory authorities may
specify the format and accounting methodology to be used.

2.
Without prejudice to Article 20, to facilitate the verification of compliance with obligations of transparency and nondiscrimination, national regulatory authorities shall have the power to require that accounting records, including data on
revenues received from third parties, are provided on request. National regulatory authorities may publish information that
would contribute to an open and competitive market, while complying with Union and national rules on commercial
confidentiality.

Article 72
Access to civil engineering

1.
A national regulatory authority may, in accordance with Article 68, impose obligations on undertakings to meet
reasonable requests for access to, and use of, civil engineering including, but not limited to, buildings or entries to buildings,
building cables, including wiring, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions, poles, masts, ducts, conduits,
inspection chambers, manholes, and cabinets, in situations where, having considered the market analysis, the national
regulatory authority concludes that denial of access or access given under unreasonable terms and conditions having a
similar effect would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market and would not be in the end-user’s interest.

2.
National regulatory authorities may impose obligations on an undertaking to provide access in accordance with this
Article, irrespective of whether the assets that are affected by the obligation are part of the relevant market in accordance
with the market analysis, provided that the obligation is necessary and proportionate to meet the objectives of Article 3.

Article 73
Obligations of access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities

1.
National regulatory authorities may, in accordance with Article 68, impose obligations on undertakings to meet
reasonable requests for access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities, in situations where the
national regulatory authorities consider that denial of access or unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect
would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level, and would not be in the end-user’s
interest.

National regulatory authorities may require undertakings inter alia:

(a) to give third parties access to, and use of, specific physical network elements and associated facilities, as appropriate,
including unbundled access to the local loop and sub-loop;

(b) to give third parties access to specific active or virtual network elements and services;

(c) to negotiate in good faith with undertakings requesting access;

(d) not to withdraw access to facilities already granted;

L 321/156

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(e) to provide specific services on a wholesale basis for resale by third parties;
(f) to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the
interoperability of services or virtual network services;
(g) to provide co-location or other forms of associated facilities sharing;
(h) to provide specific services needed to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users, or roaming on mobile
networks;
(i) to provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to ensure fair competition in the
provision of services;
(j) to interconnect networks or network facilities;
(k) to provide access to associated services such as identity, location and presence service.
National regulatory authorities may subject those obligations to conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and
timeliness.
2.
Where national regulatory authorities consider the appropriateness of imposing any of the possible specific
obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, and in particular where they assess, in accordance with the principle of
proportionality, whether and how such obligations are to be imposed, they shall analyse whether other forms of access to
wholesale inputs, either on the same or on a related wholesale market, would be sufficient to address the identified problem
in the end-user’s interest. That assessment shall include commercial access offers, regulated access pursuant to Article 61, or
existing or planned regulated access to other wholesale inputs pursuant to this Article. National regulatory authorities shall
take account in particular of the following factors:
(a) the technical and economic viability of using or installing competing facilities, in light of the rate of market
development, taking into account the nature and type of interconnection or access involved, including the viability of
other upstream access products, such as access to ducts;
(b) the expected technological evolution affecting network design and management;
(c) the need to ensure technology neutrality enabling the parties to design and manage their own networks;
(d) the feasibility of providing the access offered, in relation to the capacity available;
(e) the initial investment by the facility owner, taking account of any public investment made and the risks involved in
making the investment, with particular regard to investments in, and risk levels associated with, very high capacity
networks;
(f) the need to safeguard competition in the long term, with particular attention to economically efficient infrastructurebased competition and innovative business models that support sustainable competition, such as those based on coinvestment in networks;
(g) where appropriate, any relevant intellectual property rights;
(h) the provision of pan-European services.
Where a national regulatory authority considers, in accordance with Article 68, imposing obligations on the basis of
Articles 72 or of this Article, it shall examine whether the imposition of obligations in accordance with Article 72 alone
would be a proportionate means by which to promote competition and the end-user's interest.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/157

3.
When imposing obligations on an undertaking to provide access in accordance with this Article, national regulatory
authorities may lay down technical or operational conditions to be met by the provider or the beneficiaries of such access,
where necessary to ensure normal operation of the network. Obligations to follow specific technical standards or
specifications shall comply with the standards and specifications laid down in accordance with Article 39.

Article 74
Price control and cost accounting obligations

1.
A national regulatory authority may, in accordance with Article 68, impose obligations relating to cost recovery and
price control, including obligations for cost orientation of prices and obligations concerning cost-accounting systems, for
the provision of specific types of interconnection or access, in situations where a market analysis indicates that a lack of
effective competition means that the undertaking concerned may sustain prices at an excessively high level, or may apply a
price squeeze, to the detriment of end-users.

In determining whether price control obligations would be appropriate, national regulatory authorities shall take into
account the need to promote competition and long-term end-user interests related to the deployment and take-up of nextgeneration networks, and in particular of very high capacity networks. In particular, to encourage investments by the
undertaking, including in next-generation networks, national regulatory authorities shall take into account the investment
made by the undertaking. Where the national regulatory authorities consider price control obligations to be appropriate,
they shall allow the undertaking a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed, taking into account any risks
specific to a particular new investment network project.

National regulatory authorities shall consider not imposing or maintaining obligations pursuant to this Article, where they
establish that a demonstrable retail price constraint is present and that any obligations imposed in accordance with
Articles 69 to 73, including, in particular, any economic replicability test imposed in accordance with Article 70, ensures
effective and non-discriminatory access.

When national regulatory authorities consider it appropriate to impose price control obligations on access to existing
network elements, they shall also take account of the benefits of predictable and stable wholesale prices in ensuring efficient
market entry and sufficient incentives for all undertakings to deploy new and enhanced networks.

2.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that any cost recovery mechanism or pricing methodology that is
mandated serves to promote the deployment of new and enhanced networks, efficiency and sustainable competition and
maximises sustainable end-user benefits. In this regard, national regulatory authorities may also take account of prices
available in comparable competitive markets.

3.
Where an undertaking has an obligation regarding the cost orientation of its prices, the burden of proof that charges
are derived from costs, including a reasonable rate of return on investment, shall lie with the undertaking concerned. For
the purpose of calculating the cost of efficient provision of services, national regulatory authorities may use cost accounting
methods independent of those used by the undertaking. National regulatory authorities may require an undertaking to
provide full justification for its prices, and may, where appropriate, require prices to be adjusted.

4.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where implementation of a cost-accounting system is mandated in
order to support price control, a description of the cost-accounting system is made publicly available, showing at least the
main categories under which costs are grouped and the rules used for the allocation of costs. A qualified independent body
shall verify compliance with the cost-accounting system and shall publish annually a statement concerning compliance.

Article 75
Termination rates

1.
By 31 December 2020, the Commission shall, taking utmost account of the opinion of BEREC, adopt a delegated act
in accordance with Article 117 supplementing this Directive by setting a single maximum Union-wide mobile voice
termination rate and a single maximum Union-wide fixed voice termination rate (together referred to as ‘the Union-wide
voice termination rates’), which are imposed on any provider of mobile voice termination or fixed voice termination
services, respectively, in any Member State.

To that end, the Commission shall:

(a) comply with the principles, criteria and parameters provided in Annex III;

(b) when setting the Union-wide voice termination rates for the first time, take into account the weighted average of
efficient costs in fixed and mobile networks established in accordance with the principles provided in Annex III, applied
across the Union; the Union-wide voice termination rates in the first delegated act shall not be higher than the highest
rate among the rates that were in force six months before the adoption of that delegated act in all Member States, after
any necessary adjustment for exceptional national circumstances;

(c) take into account the total number of end-users in each Member State, in order to ensure a proper weighting of the
maximum termination rates, as well as national circumstances which result in significant differences between
Member States when determining the maximum termination rates in the Union;

(d) take into account market information provided by BEREC, national regulatory authorities or, directly, by undertakings
providing electronic communications networks and services; and

(e) consider the need to allow for a transitional period of no longer than 12 months in order to allow adjustments in
Member States where this is necessary on the basis of rates previously imposed.

2.
Taking utmost account of the opinion of BEREC, the Commission shall review the delegated act adopted pursuant to
this Article every five years and shall consider on each such occasion, by applying the criteria listed in Article 67(1),
whether setting Union-wide voice termination rates continue to be necessary. Where the Commission decides, following its
review in accordance with this paragraph, not to impose a maximum mobile voice termination rate or a maximum fixed
voice termination rate, or neither, national regulatory authorities may conduct market analyses of voice termination
markets in accordance with Article 67, to assess whether the imposition of regulatory obligations is necessary. If a national
regulatory authority imposes, as a result of such analysis, cost-oriented termination rates in a relevant market, it shall follow
the principles, criteria and parameters set out in Annex III and its draft measure shall be subject to the procedures referred
to in Articles 23, 32 and 33.

3.
National regulatory authorities shall closely monitor, and ensure compliance with, the application of the Union-wide
voice termination rates by providers of voice termination services. National regulatory authorities may, at any time, require
a provider of voice termination services to amend the rate it charges to other undertakings if it does not comply with the
delegated act referred to in paragraph 1. National regulatory authorities shall annually report to the Commission and to
BEREC with regard to the application of this Article.

Article 76
Regulatory treatment of new very high capacity network elements

1.
Undertakings which have been designated as having significant market power in one or several relevant markets in
accordance with Article 67 may offer commitments, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 79 and subject to
the second subparagraph of this paragraph, to open the deployment of a new very high capacity network that consists of
optical fibre elements up to the end-user premises or base station to co-investment, for example by offering co-ownership
or long-term risk sharing through co-financing or through purchase agreements giving rise to specific rights of a structural
character by other providers of electronic communications networks or services.

When the national regulatory authority assesses those commitments, it shall determine, in particular, whether the offer to
co-invest complies with all of the following conditions:

(a) it is open at any moment during the lifetime of the network to any provider of electronic communications networks or
services;

(b) it would allow other co-investors which are providers of electronic communications networks or services to compete
effectively and sustainably in the long term in downstream markets in which the undertaking designated as having
significant market power is active, on terms which include:

(i) fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms allowing access to the full capacity of the network to the extent that
it is subject to co-investment;

(ii) flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the participation of each co-investor;

(iii) the possibility to increase such participation in the future; and

(iv) reciprocal rights awarded by the co-investors after the deployment of the co-invested infrastructure;

(c) it is made public by the undertaking in a timely manner and, if the undertaking does not have the characteristics listed
in Article 80(1), at least six months before the start of the deployment of the new network; that period may be
prolonged based on national circumstances;

(d) access seekers not participating in the co-investment can benefit from the outset from the same quality, speed,
conditions and end-user reach as were available before the deployment, accompanied by a mechanism of adaptation
over time confirmed by the national regulatory authority in light of developments on the related retail markets, that
maintains the incentives to participate in the co-investment; such mechanism shall ensure that access seekers have
access to the very high capacity elements of the network at a time, and on the basis of transparent and nondiscriminatory terms, which reflect appropriately the degrees of risk incurred by the respective co-investors at different
stages of the deployment and take into account the competitive situation in retail markets;

(e) it complies at a minimum with the criteria set out in Annex IV and is made in good faith.

2.
If the national regulatory authority concludes, taking into account the results of the market test conducted in
accordance with Article 79(2), that the co-investment commitment offered complies with the conditions set out in
paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall make that commitment binding pursuant to Article 79(3), and shall not impose any
additional obligations pursuant to Article 68 as regards the elements of the new very high capacity network that are subject
to the commitments, if at least one potential co-investor has entered into a co-investment agreement with the undertaking
designated as having significant market power.

The first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the regulatory treatment of circumstances that do not comply with the
conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, taking into account the results of any market test conducted in accordance
with Article 79(2), but that have an impact on competition and are taken into account for the purposes of Articles 67
and 68.

By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, a national regulatory authority may, in duly justified
circumstances, impose, maintain or adapt remedies in accordance with Articles 68 to 74 as regards new very high capacity
networks in order to address significant competition problems on specific markets, where the national regulatory authority
establishes that, given the specific characteristics of these markets, those competition problems would not otherwise be
addressed.

3.
National regulatory authorities shall, on an ongoing basis, monitor compliance with the conditions set out in
paragraph 1 and may require the undertaking designated as having significant market power to provide it with annual
compliance statements.

This Article shall be without prejudice to the power of a national regulatory authority to take decisions pursuant to
Article 26(1) in the event of a dispute arising between undertakings in connection with a co-investment agreement
considered by it to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.

4.
BEREC, after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, shall publish guidelines to foster
the consistent application by national regulatory authorities of the conditions set out in paragraph 1, and the criteria set out
in Annex IV.

Article 77
Functional separation

1.
Where the national regulatory authority concludes that the appropriate obligations imposed under Articles 69 to 74
have failed to achieve effective competition and that there are important and persisting competition problems or market
failures identified in relation to the wholesale provision of certain access product markets, it may, on an exceptional basis, in
accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 68(3), impose an obligation on vertically integrated undertakings to
place activities related to the wholesale provision of relevant access products in a business entity operating independently.

That business entity shall supply access products and services to all undertakings, including to other business entities within
the parent company, on the same timescales, terms and conditions, including those relating to price and service levels, and
by means of the same systems and processes.

2.
When a national regulatory authority intends to impose an obligation of functional separation, it shall submit a
request to the Commission that includes:

(a) evidence justifying the conclusions of the national regulatory authority as referred to in paragraph 1;

(b) a reasoned assessment concluding that there is no or little prospect of effective and sustainable infrastructure-based
competition within a reasonable time-frame;

(c) an analysis of the expected impact on the national regulatory authority, on the undertaking, in particular on the
workforce of the separated undertaking, and on the electronic communications sector as a whole, and on incentives to
invest therein, in particular with regard to the need to ensure social and territorial cohesion, and on other stakeholders
including, in particular, the expected impact on competition and any potential resulting effects on consumers;

(d) an analysis of the reasons justifying that this obligation would be the most efficient means to enforce remedies aimed at
addressing the competition problems or the markets failures identified.

17.12.2018

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/161

The draft measure shall include the following elements:

(a) the precise nature and level of separation, specifying in particular the legal status of the separate business entity;
(b) an identification of the assets of the separate business entity, and the products or services to be supplied by that entity;
(c) the governance arrangements to ensure the independence of the staff employed by the separate business entity, and the
corresponding incentive structure;
(d) rules for ensuring compliance with the obligations;
(e) rules for ensuring transparency of operational procedures, in particular towards other stakeholders;
(f) a monitoring programme to ensure compliance, including the publication of an annual report.
Following the Commission’s decision taken in accordance with Article 68(3) on that draft measure, the national regulatory
authority shall conduct a coordinated analysis of the different markets related to the access network in accordance with the
procedure set out in Article 67. On the basis of that analysis, the national regulatory authority shall impose, maintain,
amend or withdraw obligations, in accordance with the procedures set out in Articles 23 and 32.
4.
An undertaking on which functional separation has been imposed may be subject to any of the obligations referred to
in Articles 69 to 74 in any specific market where it has been designated as having significant market power in accordance
with Article 67, or any other obligations authorised by the Commission pursuant to Article 68(3).
Article 78
Voluntary separation by a vertically integrated undertaking
1.
Undertakings which have been designated as having significant market power in one or several relevant markets in
accordance with Article 67 shall inform the national regulatory authority at least three months before any intended transfer
of their local access network assets or a substantial part thereof to a separate legal entity under different ownership, or
establishment of a separate business entity in order to provide all retail providers, including its own retail divisions, with
fully equivalent access products.
Those undertakings shall also inform the national regulatory authority of any change of that intent, as well as the final
outcome of the process of separation.
Such undertakings may also offer commitments regarding access conditions that are to apply to their network during an
implementation period after the proposed form of separation is implemented, with a view to ensuring effective and nondiscriminatory access by third parties. The offer of commitments shall include sufficient details, including in terms of
timing of implementation and duration, in order to allow the national regulatory authority to conduct its tasks in
accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. Such commitments may extend beyond the maximum period for market
reviews set out in Article 67(5).
2.
The national regulatory authority shall assess the effect of the intended transaction, together with the commitments
offered, where applicable, on existing regulatory obligations under this Directive.
For that purpose, the national regulatory authority shall conduct an analysis of the different markets related to the access
network in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 67.
The national regulatory authority shall take into account any commitments offered by the undertaking, having regard in
particular to the objectives set out in Article 3. In so doing, the national regulatory authority shall consult third parties in
accordance with Article 23, and shall address, in particular, those third parties which are directly affected by the intended
transaction.

L 321/162

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

On the basis of its analysis, the national regulatory authority shall impose, maintain, amend or withdraw obligations, in
accordance with the procedures set out in Articles 23 and 32, applying, if appropriate, Article 80. In its decision, the
national regulatory authority may make the commitments binding, wholly or in part. By way of derogation from Article 67
(5), the national regulatory authority may make the commitments binding, wholly or in part, for the entire period for which
they are offered.

3.
Without prejudice to Article 80, the legally or operationally separate business entity that has been designated as
having significant market power in any specific market in accordance with Article 67 may be subject, as appropriate, to any
of the obligations referred to in Articles 69 to 74 or any other obligations authorised by the Commission pursuant to
Article 68(3), where any commitments offered are insufficient to meet the objectives set out in Article 3.

4.
The national regulatory authority shall monitor the implementation of the commitments offered by the undertakings
that it has made binding in accordance with paragraph 2 and shall consider their extension when the period for which they
are initially offered has expired.

Article 79
Commitments procedure

1.
Undertakings designated as having significant market power may offer to the national regulatory authority
commitments regarding conditions for access, co-investment, or both, applicable to their networks in relation, inter alia, to:

(a) cooperative arrangements relevant to the assessment of appropriate and proportionate obligations pursuant to
Article 68;

(b) co-investment in very high capacity networks pursuant to Article 76; or

(c) effective and non-discriminatory access by third parties pursuant to Article 78, both during an implementation period
of voluntary separation by a vertically integrated undertaking and after the proposed form of separation is
implemented.

The offer for commitments shall be sufficiently detailed including as to the timing and scope of their implementation and
their duration, to allow the national regulatory authority to undertake its assessment pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Article. Such commitments may extend beyond the periods for carrying out market analysis provided in Article 67(5).

2.
In order to assess any commitments offered by an undertaking pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, the national
regulatory authority shall, except where such commitments clearly do not fulfil one or more relevant conditions or criteria,
perform a market test, in particular on the offered terms, by conducting a public consultation of interested parties, in
particular third parties which are directly affected. Potential co-investors or access seekers may provide views on the
compliance of the commitments offered with the conditions provided, as applicable, in Article 68, 76 or 78 and may
propose changes.

As regards the commitments offered under this Article, the national regulatory authority shall, when assessing obligations
pursuant to Article 68(4), have particular regard to:

(a) evidence regarding the fair and reasonable character of the commitments offered;

(b) the openness of the commitments to all market participants;

(c) the timely availability of access under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions, including to very high
capacity networks, before the launch of related retail services; and

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/163

(d) the overall adequacy of the commitments offered to enable sustainable competition on downstream markets and to
facilitate cooperative deployment and take-up of very high capacity networks in the interest of end-users.

Taking into account all the views expressed in the consultation, and the extent to which such views are representative of
different stakeholders, the national regulatory authority shall communicate to the undertaking designated as having
significant market power its preliminary conclusions whether the commitments offered comply with the objectives, criteria
and procedures set out in this Article and, as applicable, in Article 68, 76 or 78, and under which conditions it may
consider making the commitments binding. The undertaking may revise its initial offer to take account of the preliminary
conclusions of the national regulatory authority and with a view to satisfying the criteria set out in this Article and, as
applicable, in Article 68, 76 or 78.

3.
Without prejudice to first subparagraph of Article 76(2), the national regulatory authority may issue a decision to
make the commitments binding, wholly or in part.

By way of derogation from Article 67(5), the national regulatory authority may make some or all commitments binding for
a specific period, which may be the entire period for which they are offered, and in the case of co-investment commitments
made binding pursuant to first subparagraph of Article 76(2), it shall make them binding for a period of minimum seven
years.

Subject to Article 76, this Article is without prejudice to the application of the market analysis procedure pursuant to
Article 67 and the imposition of obligations pursuant to Article 68.

Where the national regulatory authority makes commitments binding pursuant to this Article, it shall assess under
Article 68 the consequences of that decision for market development and the appropriateness of any obligation that it has
imposed or would, absent those commitments, have considered imposing pursuant to that Article or Articles 69 to 74.
When notifying the relevant draft measure under Article 68 in accordance with Article 32, the national regulatory authority
shall accompany the notified draft measure with the commitments decision.

4.
The national regulatory authority shall monitor, supervise and ensure compliance with the commitments that it has
made binding in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article in the same way in which it monitors, supervises and ensures
compliance with obligations imposed under Article 68 and shall consider the extension of the period for which they have
been made binding when the initial period expires. If the national regulatory authority concludes that an undertaking has
not complied with the commitments that have been made binding in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, it may
impose penalties on such undertaking in accordance with Article 29. Without prejudice to the procedure for ensuring
compliance of specific obligations under Article 30, the national regulatory authority may reassess the obligations imposed
in accordance with Article 68(6).

Article 80
Wholesale-only undertakings

1.
A national regulatory authority that designates an undertaking which is absent from any retail markets for electronic
communications services as having significant market power in one or several wholesale markets in accordance with
Article 67 shall consider whether that undertaking has the following characteristics:

(a) all companies and business units within the undertaking, all companies that are controlled but not necessarily wholly
owned by the same ultimate owner, and any shareholder capable of exercising control over the undertaking, only have
activities, current and planned for the future, in wholesale markets for electronic communications services and therefore
do not have activities in any retail market for electronic communications services provided to end-users in the Union;

(b) the undertaking is not bound to deal with a single and separate undertaking operating downstream that is active in any
retail market for electronic communications services provided to end-users, because of an exclusive agreement, or an
agreement which de facto amounts to an exclusive agreement.

L 321/164

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

2.
If the national regulatory authority concludes that the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article are fulfilled,
it may impose on that undertaking only obligations pursuant to Articles 70 and 73 or relative to fair and reasonable pricing
if justified on the basis of a market analysis including a prospective assessment of the likely behaviour of the undertaking
designated as having significant market power.

3.
The national regulatory authority shall review obligations imposed on the undertaking in accordance with this Article
at any time if it concludes that the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article are no longer met and it shall, as
appropriate, apply Articles 67 to 74. The undertakings shall, without undue delay, inform the national regulatory authority
of any change of circumstance relevant to points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article.

4.
The national regulatory authority shall also review obligations imposed on the undertaking in accordance with this
Article if on the basis of evidence of terms and conditions offered by the undertaking to its downstream customers, the
authority concludes that competition problems have arisen or are likely to arise to the detriment of end-users which require
the imposition of one or more obligations provided in Article 69, 71, 72 or 74, or the amendment of the obligations
imposed in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.

5.
The imposition of obligations and their review in accordance with this Article shall be implemented in accordance
with the procedures referred to in Articles 23, 32 and 33.

Article 81
Migration from legacy infrastructure

1.
Undertakings which have been designated as having significant market power in one or several relevant markets in
accordance with Article 67 shall notify the national regulatory authority in advance and in a timely manner when they plan
to decommission or replace with a new infrastructure parts of the network, including legacy infrastructure necessary to
operate a copper network, which are subject to obligations pursuant to Articles 68 to 80.

2.
The national regulatory authority shall ensure that the decommissioning or replacement process includes a
transparent timetable and conditions, including an appropriate notice period for transition, and establishes the availability
of alternative products of at least comparable quality providing access to the upgraded network infrastructure substituting
the replaced elements if necessary to safeguard competition and the rights of end-users.

With regard to assets which are proposed for decommissioning or replacement, the national regulatory authority may
withdraw the obligations after having ascertained that the access provider:

(a) has established the appropriate conditions for migration, including making available an alternative access product of at
least comparable quality as was available using the legacy infrastructure enabling the access seekers to reach the same
end-users; and

(b) has complied with the conditions and process notified to the national regulatory authority in accordance with this
Article.

Such withdrawal shall be implemented in accordance with the procedures referred to in Articles 23, 32 and 33.

3.
This Article shall be without prejudice to the availability of regulated products imposed by the national regulatory
authority on the upgraded network infrastructure in accordance with the procedures set out in Articles 67 and 68.

Article 82
BEREC guidelines on very high capacity networks

By 21 December 2020, BEREC shall, after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, issue
guidelines on the criteria that a network is to fulfil in order to be considered a very high capacity network, in particular in
terms of down- and uplink bandwidth, resilience, error-related parameters, and latency and its variation. The national
regulatory authorities shall take those guidelines into utmost account. BEREC shall update the guidelines by 31 December
2025, and regularly thereafter.

CHAPTER V

Regulatory control of retail services

Article 83
Regulatory control of retail services

1.
Member States may ensure that national regulatory authorities impose appropriate regulatory obligations on
undertakings identified as having significant market power on a given retail market in accordance with Article 63, where:

(a) as a result of a market analysis carried out in accordance with Article 67, a national regulatory authority determines that
a given retail market identified in accordance with Article 64 is not effectively competitive; and

(b) the national regulatory authority concludes that obligations imposed under Articles 69 to 74 would not result in the
achievement of the objectives set out in Article 3.

2.
Obligations imposed under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be based on the nature of the problem identified and be
proportionate and justified in light of the objectives laid down in Article 3. The obligations imposed may include
requirements that the identified undertakings do not charge excessive prices, inhibit market entry or restrict competition by
setting predatory prices, show undue preference to specific end-users or unreasonably bundle services. National regulatory
authorities may apply to such undertakings appropriate retail price cap measures, measures to control individual tariffs, or
measures to orient tariffs towards costs or prices on comparable markets, in order to protect end-user interests whilst
promoting effective competition.

3.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where an undertaking is subject to retail tariff regulation or other
relevant retail controls, the necessary and appropriate cost-accounting systems are implemented. National regulatory
authorities may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used. Compliance with the cost-accounting system
shall be verified by a qualified independent body. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that a statement concerning
compliance is published annually.

4.
Without prejudice to Articles 85 and 88, national regulatory authorities shall not apply retail control mechanisms
under paragraph 1 of this Article to geographical or retail markets where they are satisfied that there is effective
competition.

PART III
SERVICES

TITLE I
UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATIONS

Article 84
Affordable universal service
1.
Member States shall ensure that all consumers in their territories have access at an affordable price, in light of specific
national conditions, to an available adequate broadband internet access service and to voice communications services at the
quality specified in their territories, including the underlying connection, at a fixed location.
2.
In addition, Member States may also ensure the affordability of the services referred to in paragraph 1 that are not
provided at a fixed location where they consider this to be necessary to ensure consumers’ full social and economic
participation in society.
3.
Each Member State shall, in light of national conditions and the minimum bandwidth enjoyed by the majority of
consumers within the territory of that Member State, and taking into account the BEREC report on best practices, define the
adequate broadband internet access service for the purposes of paragraph 1 with a view to ensuring the bandwidth
necessary for social and economic participation in society. The adequate broadband internet access service shall be capable
of delivering the bandwidth necessary for supporting at least the minimum set of services set out in Annex V.
By 21 June 2020, BEREC shall, in order to contribute towards a consistent application of this Article, after consulting
stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, taking into account available Commission (Eurostat) data,
draw up a report on Member States’ best practices to support the defining of adequate broadband internet access service
pursuant to the first subparagraph. That report shall be updated regularly to reflect technological advances and changes in
consumer usage patterns.
4.
When a consumer so requests, the connection referred to in paragraph 1 and, where applicable, in paragraph 2 may
be limited to support voice communications services.
5.
Member States may extend the scope of application of this Article to end-users that are microenterprises and small
and medium-sized enterprises and not-for-profit organisations.
Article 85
Provision of affordable universal service
1.
National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities shall monitor the evolution and
level of retail prices of the services referred to in Article 84(1) available on the market, in particular in relation to national
prices and national consumer income.
2.
Where Member States establish that, in light of national conditions, retail prices for the services referred to in
Article 84(1) are not affordable, because consumers with a low income or special social needs are prevented from accessing
such services, they shall take measures to ensure affordability for such consumers of adequate broadband internet access
service and voice communications services at least at a fixed location.
To that end, Member States may ensure that support is provided to such consumers for communication purposes or require
providers of such services to offer to those consumers tariff options or packages different from those provided under
normal commercial conditions, or both. For that purpose, Member States may require such providers to apply common
tariffs, including geographic averaging, throughout the territory.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/167

In exceptional circumstances, in particular where the imposition of obligations under the second subparagraph of this
paragraph on all providers would result in a demonstrated excessive administrative or financial burden for providers or the
Member State, a Member State may, on an exceptional basis, decide to impose the obligation to offer those specific tariff
options or packages only on designated undertakings. Article 86 shall apply to such designations mutatis mutandis. Where
a Member State designates undertakings, it shall ensure that all consumers with a low-income or special social needs benefit
from a choice of undertakings offering tariff options addressing their needs, unless ensuring such choice is impossible or
would create an excessive additional organisational or financial burden.

Member States shall ensure that consumers entitled to such tariff options or packages have a right to conclude a contract
either with a provider of the services referred to in Article 84(1), or with an undertaking designated in accordance with this
paragraph, and that their number remains available to them for an adequate period and unwarranted disconnection of the
service is avoided.

3.
Member States shall ensure that undertakings which provide tariff options or packages to consumers with a low
income or special social needs pursuant to paragraph 2 keep the national regulatory and other competent authorities
informed of the details of such offers. National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities shall
ensure that the conditions under which undertakings provide tariff options or packages pursuant to paragraph 2 are fully
transparent and are published and applied in accordance with the principle of non-discrimination. National regulatory
authorities in coordination with other competent authorities may require such tariff options or packages to be modified or
withdrawn.

4.
Member States shall ensure, in light of national conditions, that support is provided, as appropriate, to consumers
with disabilities, and that other specific measures are taken, where appropriate, with a view to ensuring that related terminal
equipment, and specific equipment and specific services that enhance equivalent access, including where necessary total
conversation services and relay services, are available and affordable.

5.

When applying this Article, Member States shall seek to minimise market distortions.

6.
Member States may extend the scope of application of this Article to end-users that are microenterprises and small
and medium-sized enterprises and not-for-profit organisations.

Article 86
Availability of universal service

1.
Where a Member State has established, taking into account the results, where available, of the geographical survey
conducted in accordance with Article 22(1), and any additional evidence where necessary, that the availability at a fixed
location of an adequate broadband internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 84(3) and of voice
communications services cannot be ensured under normal commercial circumstances or through other potential public
policy tools in its national territory or different parts thereof, it may impose appropriate universal service obligations to
meet all reasonable requests by end-users for accessing those services in the relevant parts of its territory.

2.
Member States shall determine the most efficient and appropriate approach for ensuring the availability at a fixed
location of an adequate broadband internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 84(3) and of voice
communications services, whilst respecting the principles of objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and
proportionality. Member States shall seek to minimise market distortions, in particular the provision of services at
prices or subject to other terms and conditions which depart from normal commercial conditions, whilst safeguarding the
public interest.

L 321/168

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

3.
In particular, where Member States decide to impose obligations to ensure for end-users the availability at a fixed
location of an adequate broadband internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 84(3) and of voice
communications services, they may designate one or more undertakings to guarantee such availability throughout the
national territory. Member States may designate different undertakings or sets of undertakings to provide an adequate
broadband internet access service and voice communications services at a fixed location or to cover different parts of the
national territory.

4.
When Member States designate undertakings in part or all of the national territory to ensure availability of services in
accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, they shall use an efficient, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory
designation mechanism, whereby no undertaking is a priori excluded from being designated. Such designation methods
shall ensure that an adequate broadband internet access service and voice communications services at a fixed location are
provided in a cost-effective manner and may be used as a means of determining the net cost of the universal service
obligations in accordance with Article 89.

5.
When an undertaking designated in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article intends to dispose of a substantial
part or all of its local access network assets to a separate legal entity under different ownership, it shall inform the national
regulatory or other competent authority in advance and in a timely manner, in order to allow that authority to assess the
effect of the intended transaction on the provision at a fixed location of an adequate broadband internet access service as
defined in accordance with Article 84(3) and of voice communications services. The national regulatory or other competent
authority may impose, amend or withdraw specific obligations in accordance with Article 13(2).

Article 87
Status of the existing universal service

Member States may continue to ensure the availability or affordability of other services than adequate broadband internet
access service as defined in accordance with Article 84(3) and voice communications services at a fixed location that were
in force on 20 December 2018, if the need for such services is established in light of national circumstances. When
Member States designate undertakings in part or all of the national territory for the provision of those services, Article 86
shall apply. Financing of those obligations shall comply with Article 90.

Member States shall review the obligations imposed pursuant to this Article by 21 December 2021, and every three years
thereafter.

Article 88
Control of expenditure

1.
Member States shall ensure that, in providing facilities and services additional to those referred to in Article 84,
providers of an adequate broadband internet access service and of voice communications services in accordance with
Articles 84 to 87 establish terms and conditions in such a way that the end-user is not obliged to pay for facilities or
services which are not necessary or not required for the service requested.

2.
Member States shall ensure that the providers of an adequate broadband internet access service and of voice
communications services referred to in Article 84 that provide services pursuant to Article 85 offer the specific facilities
and services set out in Part A of Annex VI as applicable, in order that consumers can monitor and control expenditure.
Member States shall ensure that such providers put in place a system to avoid unwarranted disconnection of voice
communications services or of an adequate broadband internet access service with regard to consumers as referred to in
Article 85, including an appropriate mechanism to check continued interest in using the service.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/169

Member States may extend the scope of application of this paragraph to end-users that are microenterprises and small and
medium-sized enterprises and not-for-profit organisations.

3.
Each Member State shall ensure that the competent authority is able to waive the requirements of paragraph 2 in all or
part of its national territory if the competent authority is satisfied that the facility is widely available.

Article 89
Cost of universal service obligations

1.
Where national regulatory authorities consider that the provision of an adequate broadband internet access service as
defined in accordance with Article 84(3) and of voice communications services as set out in Articles 84, 85 and 86 or the
continuation of the existing universal service as set out in Article 87 may represent an unfair burden on providers of such
services that request compensation, national regulatory authorities shall calculate the net costs of such provision.

For that purpose, national regulatory authorities shall:

(a) calculate the net cost of the universal service obligations, taking into account any market benefit which accrues to a
provider of an adequate broadband internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 84(3) and voice
communications services as set out in Articles 84, 85 and 86 or the continuation of the existing universal service as set
out in Article 87, in accordance with Annex VII; or

(b) make use of the net costs of providing universal service identified by a designation mechanism in accordance with
Article 86(4).

2.
The accounts and other information serving as the basis for the calculation of the net cost of universal service
obligations under point (a) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be audited or verified by the national
regulatory authority or a body independent of the relevant parties and approved by the national regulatory authority. The
results of the cost calculation and the conclusions of the audit shall be publicly available.

Article 90
Financing of universal service obligations

1.
Where, on the basis of the net cost calculation referred to in Article 89, national regulatory authorities find that a
provider is subject to an unfair burden, Member States shall, upon request from the provider concerned, decide to do one or
both of the following:

(a) introduce a mechanism to compensate that provider for the determined net costs under transparent conditions from
public funds;

(b) share the net cost of universal service obligations between providers of electronic communications networks and
services.

2.
Where the net cost is shared in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States shall establish
a sharing mechanism administered by the national regulatory authority or a body independent from the beneficiaries under
the supervision of the national regulatory authority. Only the net cost, as determined in accordance with Article 89, of the
obligations laid down in Articles 84 to 87 may be financed.

The sharing mechanism shall respect the principles of transparency, least market distortion, non-discrimination and
proportionality, in accordance with the principles set out in Part B of Annex VII. Member States may choose not to require
contributions from undertakings the national turnover of which is less than a set limit.

Any charges related to the sharing of the cost of universal service obligations shall be unbundled and identified separately
for each undertaking. Such charges shall not be imposed on, or collected from, undertakings that are not providing services
in the territory of the Member State that has established the sharing mechanism.
Article 91
Transparency
1.
Where the net cost of universal service obligations is to be calculated in accordance with Article 89, national
regulatory authorities shall ensure that the principles for net cost calculation, including the details of methodology to be
used are publicly available.
Where a mechanism for sharing the net cost of universal service obligations as referred to in Article 90(2) is established,
national regulatory authorities shall ensure that the principles for cost sharing and compensation of the net cost are
publicly available.
2.
Subject to Union and national rules on commercial confidentiality, national regulatory authorities shall publish an
annual report providing the details of calculated cost of universal service obligations, identifying the contributions made by
all undertakings involved, including any market benefits that may have accrued to the undertakings pursuant to universal
service obligations laid down in Articles 84 to 87.
Article 92
Additional mandatory services
Member States may decide to make services additional to those included in the universal service obligations referred to in
Articles 84 to 87, publicly available on their territories. In such cases, no compensation mechanism involving specific
undertakings shall be imposed.

TITLE II
NUMBERING RESOURCES

Article 93
Numbering resources
1.
Member States shall ensure that national regulatory or other competent authorities control the granting of rights of
use for all national numbering resources and the management of the national numbering plans and that they provide
adequate numbering resources for the provision of publicly available electronic communications services. Member States
shall ensure that objective, transparent and non-discriminatory procedures for granting rights of use for national
numbering resources are established.
2.
National regulatory or other competent authorities may also grant rights of use for numbering resources from the
national numbering plans for the provision of specific services to undertakings other than providers of electronic
communications networks or services, provided that adequate numbering resources are made available to satisfy current
and foreseeable future demand. Those undertakings shall demonstrate their ability to manage the numbering resources and
to comply with any relevant requirements set out pursuant to Article 94. National regulatory or other competent
authorities may suspend the further granting of rights of use for numbering resources to such undertakings if it is
demonstrated that there is a risk of exhaustion of numbering resources.
By 21 June 2020, in order to contribute to the consistent application of this paragraph, BEREC shall adopt, after consulting
stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, guidelines on common criteria for the assessment of the ability
to manage numbering resources and of the risk of exhaustion of numbering resources.

17.12.2018

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/171

3.
National regulatory or other competent authorities shall ensure that national numbering plans and procedures are
applied in a manner that gives equal treatment to all providers of publicly available electronic communications services and
the undertakings eligible in accordance with paragraph 2. In particular, Member States shall ensure that an undertaking to
which the right of use for numbering resources has been granted does not discriminate against other providers of electronic
communications services as regards the numbering resources used to give access to their services.

4.
Each Member State shall ensure that national regulatory or other competent authorities make available a range of
non-geographic numbers which may be used for the provision of electronic communications services other than
interpersonal communications services, throughout the territory of the Union, without prejudice to Regulation (EU)
No 531/2012 and Article 97(2) of this Directive. Where rights of use for numbering resources have been granted in
accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks
or services, this paragraph shall apply to the specific services for the provision of which the rights of use have been granted.

National regulatory or other competent authorities shall ensure that the conditions listed in Part E of Annex I that may be
attached to the rights of use for numbering resources used for the provision of services outside the Member State of the
country code, and their enforcement, are as stringent as the conditions and enforcement applicable to services provided
within the Member State of the country code, in accordance with this Directive. National regulatory or other competent
authorities shall also ensure in accordance with Article 94(6) that providers using numbering resources of their country
code in other Member States comply with consumer protection and other national rules related to the use of numbering
resources applicable in those Member States where the numbering resources are used. This obligation is without prejudice
to the enforcement powers of the competent authorities of those Member States.

BEREC shall assist national regulatory or other competent authorities, at their request, in coordinating their activities to
ensure the efficient management of numbering resources with a right of extraterritorial use within the Union.

In order to facilitate the monitoring by the national regulatory or other competent authorities of compliance with the
requirements of this paragraph, BEREC shall establish a database on the numbering resources with a right of extraterritorial
use within the Union. For this purpose, national regulatory or other competent authorities shall transmit the relevant
information to BEREC. Where numbering resources with a right of extraterritorial use within the Union are not granted by
the national regulatory authority, the competent authority responsible for their granting or management shall consult the
national regulatory authority.

5.
Member States shall ensure that the ‘00’ code is the standard international access code. Special arrangements for the
use of number-based interpersonal communications services between locations adjacent to one another across borders
between Member States may be established or continued.

Member States may agree to share a common numbering plan for all or specific categories of numbers.

End-users affected by such arrangements or agreements shall be fully informed.

6.
Without prejudice to Article 106, Member States shall promote over-the-air provisioning, where technically feasible,
to facilitate switching of providers of electronic communications networks or services by end-users, in particular providers
and end-users of machine-to-machine services.

L 321/172

EN

7.
Member States shall ensure that the national numbering plans, and all subsequent additions or amendments thereto,
are published, subject only to limitations imposed on the grounds of national security.

8.
Member States shall support the harmonisation of specific numbers or numbering ranges within the Union where it
promotes both the functioning of the internal market and the development of pan-European services. Where necessary to
address unmet cross-border or pan-European demand for numbering resources, the Commission shall, taking utmost
account of the opinion of BEREC, adopt implementing acts harmonising specific numbers or numbering ranges.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 118(4).

Article 94
Procedure for granting of rights of use for numbering resources

1.
Where it is necessary to grant individual rights of use for numbering resources, national regulatory or other
competent authorities shall grant such rights, upon request, to any undertaking for the provision of electronic
communications networks or services covered by a general authorisation referred to in Article 12, subject to Article 13
and to point (c) of Article 21(1) and to any other rules ensuring the efficient use of those numbering resources in
accordance with this Directive.

2.
The rights of use for numbering resources shall be granted through open, objective, transparent, non-discriminatory
and proportionate procedures.

When granting rights of use for numbering resources, national regulatory or other competent authorities shall specify
whether those rights can be transferred by the holder of the rights, and under which conditions.

Where national regulatory or other competent authorities grant rights of use for numbering resources for a limited period,
the duration of that period shall be appropriate for the service concerned with a view to the objective pursued, taking due
account of the need to allow for an appropriate period for investment amortisation.

3.
National regulatory or other competent authorities shall take decisions on the granting of rights of use for numbering
resources as soon as possible after receipt of the complete application and within three weeks in the case of numbering
resources that have been allocated for specific purposes within the national numbering plan. Such decisions shall be made
public.

4.
Where national regulatory or other competent authorities have determined, after consulting interested parties in
accordance with Article 23, that rights of use for numbering resources of exceptional economic value are to be granted
through competitive or comparative selection procedures, national regulatory or other competent authorities may extend
the three-week period referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article by up to a further three weeks.

5.
National regulatory or other competent authorities shall not limit the number of individual rights of use to be granted,
except where this is necessary to ensure the efficient use of numbering resources.

6.
Where the rights of use for numbering resources include their extraterritorial use within the Union in accordance
with Article 93(4), national regulatory or other competent authorities shall attach to those rights of use specific conditions
in order to ensure compliance with all the relevant national consumer protection rules and national law related to the use of
numbering resources applicable in the Member States where the numbering resources are used.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/173

Upon request from a national regulatory or other competent authority of a Member State where the numbering resources
are used, demonstrating a breach of relevant consumer protection rules or national laws related to the use of numbering
resources of that Member State, the national regulatory or other competent authorities of the Member State where the
rights of use for the numbering resources have been granted shall enforce the conditions attached under the first
subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Article 30, including, in serious cases, by withdrawing the rights of
extraterritorial use for the numbering resources granted to the undertaking concerned.

BEREC shall facilitate and coordinate the exchange of information between the competent authorities of the different
Member States involved and ensure the appropriate coordination of work among them.

7.
This Article shall also apply where national regulatory or other competent authorities grant rights of use for
numbering resources to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks or services in
accordance with Article 93(2).

Article 95
Fees for rights of use for numbering resources

Member States may allow national regulatory or other competent authorities to impose fees for the rights of use for
numbering resources which reflect the need to ensure the optimal use of those resources. Member States shall ensure that
such fees are objectively justified, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate in relation to their intended purpose
and shall take into account the objectives set out in Article 3.

Article 96
Missing children and child helpline hotlines

1.
Member States shall ensure that end-users have access free of charge to a service operating a hotline to report cases of
missing children. The hotline shall be available on the number ‘116000’.

2.
Member States shall ensure that end-users with disabilities are able to access services provided under the number
‘116000’ to the greatest extent possible. Measures taken to facilitate access by end-users with disabilities to such services
whilst travelling in other Member States shall be based on compliance with relevant standards or specifications laid down in
accordance with Article 39.

3.
Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the authority or undertaking to which the number
‘116000’ has been assigned allocates the necessary resources to operate the hotline.

4.
Member States and the Commission shall ensure that end-users are adequately informed of the existence and use of
services provided under the numbers ‘116000’ and, where appropriate, ‘116111’.

Article 97
Access to numbers and services

1.
Member States shall ensure that, where economically feasible, except where a called end-user has chosen for
commercial reasons to limit access by calling parties located in specific geographical areas, national regulatory or other
competent authorities take all necessary steps to ensure that end-users are able to:

(a) access and use services using non-geographic numbers within the Union; and

(b) access all numbers provided in the Union, regardless of the technology and devices used by the operator, including
those in the national numbering plans of Member States and Universal International Freephone Numbers (UIFN).

L 321/174

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

2.
Member States shall ensure that national regulatory or other competent authorities are able to require providers of
public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services to block, on a caseby-case basis, access to numbers or services where this is justified by reasons of fraud or misuse and to require that in such
cases providers of electronic communications services withhold relevant interconnection or other service revenues.

TITLE III
END-USER RIGHTS

Article 98
Exemption of certain microenterprises

With the exception of Articles 99 and 100, this Title shall not apply to microenterprises providing number-independent
interpersonal communications services unless they also provide other electronic communications services.

Member States shall ensure that end-users are informed of an exemption under the first paragraph before concluding a
contract with a microenterprise benefitting from such an exemption.

Article 99
Non-discrimination

Providers of electronic communications networks or services shall not apply any different requirements or general
conditions of access to, or use of, networks or services to end-users, for reasons related to the end-user’s nationality, place of
residence or place of establishment, unless such different treatment is objectively justified.

Article 100
Fundamental rights safeguard

1.
National measures regarding end-users’ access to, or use of, services and applications through electronic
communications networks shall respect the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union (the ‘Charter’) and general
principles of Union law.

2.
Any measure regarding end-users’ access to, or use of, services and applications through electronic communications
networks liable to limit the exercise of the rights or freedoms recognised by the Charter shall be imposed only if it is
provided for by law and respects those rights or freedoms, is proportionate, necessary, and genuinely meets general interest
objectives recognised by Union law or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others in line with Article 52(1) of the
Charter and with general principles of Union law, including the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. Accordingly,
such measures shall be taken only with due respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence and the right to
privacy. A prior, fair and impartial procedure shall be guaranteed, including the right to be heard of the person or persons
concerned, subject to the need for appropriate conditions and procedural arrangements in duly substantiated cases of
urgency in accordance with the Charter.

Article 101
Level of harmonisation

1.
Member States shall not maintain or introduce in their national law end-user protection provisions diverging from
Articles 102 to 115, including more, or less, stringent provisions to ensure a different level of protection, unless otherwise
provided for in this Title.

2.
Until 21 December 2021, Member States may continue to apply more stringent national consumer protection
provisions diverging from those laid down in Articles 102 to 115, provided that those provisions were in force
on 20 December 2018 and any restrictions to the functioning of the internal market resulting therefrom are proportionate
to the objective of consumer protection.

Member States shall notify the Commission by 21 December 2019 of any national provisions to be applied on the basis of
this paragraph.

Article 102
Information requirements for contracts

1.
Before a consumer is bound by a contract or any corresponding offer, providers of publicly available electronic
communications services other than transmission services used for the provision of machine-to-machine services shall
provide the information referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of Directive 2011/83/EU, and, in addition, the information listed in
Annex VIII of this Directive to the extent that that information relates to a service they provide.

The information shall be provided in a clear and comprehensible manner on a durable medium as defined in point (10) of
Article 2 of Directive 2011/83/EU or, where provision on a durable medium is not feasible, in an easily downloadable
document made available by the provider. The provider shall expressly draw the consumer’s attention to the availability of
that document and the importance of downloading it for the purposes of documentation, future reference and unchanged
reproduction.

The information shall, upon request, be provided in an accessible format for end-users with disabilities in accordance with
Union law harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services.

2.
The information referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 5 shall also be provided to end-users that are microenterprises or
small enterprises or not-for-profit organisations, unless they have explicitly agreed to waive all or parts of those provisions.

3.
Providers of publicly available electronic communications services other than transmission services used for the
provision of machine-to-machine services shall provide consumers with a concise and easily readable contract summary.
That summary shall identify the main elements of the information requirements in accordance with paragraph 1. Those
main elements shall include at least:

(a) the name, address and contact information of the provider and, if different, the contact information for any complaint;

(b) the main characteristics of each service provided;

(c) the respective prices for activating the electronic communications service and for any recurring or consumption-related
charges, where the service is provided for direct monetary payment;

(d) the duration of the contract and the conditions for its renewal and termination;

(e) the extent to which the products and services are designed for end-users with disabilities;

L 321/176

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

(f) with respect to internet access services, a summary of the information required pursuant to points (d) and (e) of
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120.

By 21 December 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting BEREC, adopt implementing acts specifying a contract
summary template to be used by the providers to fulfil their obligations under this paragraph.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 118(4).

Providers subject to the obligations under paragraph 1 shall duly complete that contract summary template with the
required information and provide the contract summary free of charge to consumers, prior to the conclusion of the
contract, including distance contracts. Where, for objective technical reasons, it is impossible to provide the contract
summary at that moment, it shall be provided without undue delay thereafter, and the contract shall become effective when
the consumer has confirmed his or her agreement after reception of the contract summary.

4.
The information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 shall become an integral part of the contract and shall not be
altered unless the contracting parties expressly agree otherwise.

5.
Where internet access services or publicly available interpersonal communications services are billed on the basis of
either time or volume consumption, their providers shall offer consumers the facility to monitor and control the usage of
each of those services. This facility shall include access to timely information on the level of consumption of services
included in a tariff plan. In particular, providers shall notify consumers before any consumption limit, as established by
competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities, included in their tariff plan, is
reached and when a service included in their tariff plan is fully consumed.

6.
Member States may maintain or introduce in their national law provisions requiring providers to provide additional
information on the consumption level and temporarily prevent further use of the relevant service in excess of a financial or
volume limit determined by the competent authority.

7.
Member States shall remain free to maintain or introduce in their national law provisions relating to aspects not
regulated by this Article, in particular in order to address newly emerging issues.

Article 103
Transparency, comparison of offers and publication of information

1.
Competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where
providers of internet access services or publicly available interpersonal communication services make the provision of those
services subject to terms and conditions, the information referred to in Annex IX is published in a clear, comprehensive,
machine-readable manner and in an accessible format for end-users with disabilities in accordance with Union law
harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services, by all such providers, or by the competent authority itself
in coordination, where relevant, with the national regulatory authority. Such information shall be updated regularly.
Competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities may specify additional
requirements regarding the form in which such information is to be published. That information shall, on request, be
supplied to the competent authority and, where relevant, to the national regulatory authority before its publication.

2.
Competent authorities shall, in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities, ensure that endusers have access free of charge to at least one independent comparison tool which enables them to compare and evaluate
different internet access services and publicly available number-based interpersonal communications services, and, where
applicable, publicly available number-independent interpersonal communications services, with regard to:

(a) prices and tariffs of services provided against recurring or consumption-based direct monetary payments; and

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/177

(b) the quality of service performance, where minimum quality of service is offered or the undertaking is required to
publish such information pursuant to Article 104.

3.

The comparison tool referred to in paragraph 2 shall:

(a) be operationally independent from the providers of such services, thereby ensuring that those providers are given equal
treatment in search results;

(b) clearly disclose the owners and operators of the comparison tool;

(c) set out clear and objective criteria on which the comparison is to be based;

(d) use plain and unambiguous language;

(e) provide accurate and up-to-date information and state the time of the last update;

(f) be open to any provider of internet access services or publicly available interpersonal communications services making
available the relevant information, and include a broad range of offers covering a significant part of the market and,
where the information presented is not a complete overview of the market, a clear statement to that effect, before
displaying results;

(g) provide an effective procedure to report incorrect information;

(h) include the possibility to compare prices, tariffs and quality of service performance between offers available to
consumers and, if required by Member States, between those offers and the standard offers publicly available to other
end-users.

Comparison tools fulfilling the requirements in points (a) to (h) shall, upon request by the provider of the tool, be certified
by competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory authorities.

Third parties shall have a right to use, free of charge and in open data formats, the information published by providers of
internet access services or publicly available interpersonal communications services, for the purposes of making available
such independent comparison tools.

4.
Member States may require that providers of internet access services or publicly available number-based interpersonal
communications services, or both, distribute public interest information free of charge to existing and new end-users, where
appropriate, by the means that they ordinarily use in their communications with end-users. In such a case, that public
interest information shall be provided by the relevant public authorities in a standardised format and shall, inter alia, cover
the following topics:

(a) the most common uses of internet access services and publicly available number-based interpersonal communications
services to engage in unlawful activities or to disseminate harmful content, in particular where it may prejudice respect
for the rights and freedoms of others, including infringements of data protection rights, copyright and related rights,
and their legal consequences; and

(b) the means of protection against risks to personal security, privacy and personal data when using internet access services
and publicly available number-based interpersonal communications services.

L 321/178

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

Article 104
Quality of service related to internet access services and publicly available interpersonal communications services

1.
National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities may require providers of internet
access services and of publicly available interpersonal communications services to publish comprehensive, comparable,
reliable, user-friendly and up-to-date information for end-users on the quality of their services, to the extent that they
control at least some elements of the network either directly or by virtue of a service level agreement to that effect, and on
measures taken to ensure equivalence in access for end-users with disabilities. National regulatory authorities in
coordination with other competent authorities may also require providers of publicly available interpersonal
communication services to inform consumers if the quality of the services they provide depends on any external factors,
such as control of signal transmission or network connectivity.

That information shall, on request, be supplied to the national regulatory and, where relevant, to other competent
authorities before its publication.

The measures to ensure quality of service shall comply with Regulation (EU) 2015/2120.

2.
National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities shall specify, taking utmost account
of BEREC guidelines, the quality of service parameters to be measured, the applicable measurement methods, and the
content, form and manner of the information to be published, including possible quality certification mechanisms. Where
appropriate, the parameters, definitions and measurement methods set out in Annex X shall be used.

By 21 June 2020, in order to contribute to a consistent application of this paragraph and of Annex X, BEREC shall, after
consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, adopt guidelines detailing the relevant quality of
service parameters, including parameters relevant for end-users with disabilities, the applicable measurement methods, the
content and format of publication of the information, and quality certification mechanisms.

Article 105
Contract duration and termination

1.
Member States shall ensure that conditions and procedures for contract termination do not act as a disincentive to
changing service provider and that contracts concluded between consumers and providers of publicly available electronic
communications services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services and other than
transmission services used for the provision of machine-to-machine services, do not mandate a commitment period longer
than 24 months. Member States may adopt or maintain provisions which mandate shorter maximum contractual
commitment periods.

This paragraph shall not apply to the duration of an instalment contract where the consumer has agreed in a separate
contract to instalment payments exclusively for deployment of a physical connection, in particular to very high capacity
networks. An instalment contract for the deployment of a physical connection shall not include terminal equipment, such
as a router or modem, and shall not preclude consumers from exercising their rights under this Article.

2.
Paragraph 1 shall also apply to end-users that are microenterprises, small enterprises or not-for-profit organisations,
unless they have explicitly agreed to waive those provisions.

17.12.2018

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 321/179

3.
Where a contract or national law provides for automatic prolongation of a fixed duration contract for electronic
communications services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services and other than
transmission services used for the provision of machine-to-machine services, Member States shall ensure that, after such
prolongation, end-users are entitled to terminate the contract at any time with a maximum one-month notice period, as
determined by Member States, and without incurring any costs except the charges for receiving the service during the notice
period. Before the contract is automatically prolonged, providers shall inform end-users, in a prominent and timely manner
and on a durable medium, of the end of the contractual commitment and of the means by which to terminate the contract.
In addition, and at the same time, providers shall give end-users best tariff advice relating to their services. Providers shall
provide end-users with best tariff information at least annually.

4.
End-users shall have the right to terminate their contract without incurring any further costs upon notice of changes
in the contractual conditions proposed by the provider of publicly available electronic communications services other than
number-independent interpersonal communications services, unless the proposed changes are exclusively to the benefit of
the end-user, are of a purely administrative nature and have no negative effect on the end-user, or are directly imposed by
Union or national law.

Providers shall notify end-users at least one month in advance of any change in the contractual conditions, and shall
simultaneously inform them of their right to terminate the contract without incurring any further costs if they do not
accept the new conditions. The right to terminate the contract shall be exercisable within one month after notification.
Member States may extend that period by up to three months. Member States shall ensure that notification is made in a
clear and comprehensible manner on a durable medium.

5.
Any significant continued or frequently recurring discrepancy between the actual performance of an electronic
communications service, other than an internet access service or a number-independent interpersonal communications
service, and the performance indicated in the contract shall be considered to be a basis for triggering the remedies available
to the consumer in accordance with national law, including the right to terminate the contract free of cost.

6.
Where an end-user has the right to terminate a contract for a publicly available electronic communications service,
other than a number-independent interpersonal communications service, before the end of the agreed contract period
pursuant to this Directive or to other provisions of Union or national law, no compensation shall be due by the end-user
other than for retained subsidised terminal equipment.

Where the end-user chooses to retain terminal equipment bundled at the moment of the contract conclusion, any
compensation due shall not exceed its pro rata temporis value as agreed at the moment of the conclusion of the contract or
the remaining part of the service fee until the end of the contract, whichever is the smaller.

Member States may determine other methods to calculate the compensation rate, provided that such methods do not result
in a level of compensation exceeding that calculated in accordance with the second subparagraph.

The provider shall lift any condition on the use of that terminal equipment on other networks free of charge at a time
specified by Member States and at the latest upon payment of the compensation.

7.
As far as transmission services used for machine-to-machine services are concerned, the rights mentioned in
paragraphs 4 and 6 shall benefit only end-users that are consumers, microenterprises, small enterprises or not-for-profit
organisations.

Article 106
Provider switching and number portability

1.
In the case of switching between providers of internet access services, the providers concerned shall provide the enduser with adequate information before and during the switching process and ensure continuity of the internet access
service, unless technically not feasible. The receiving provider shall ensure that the activation of the internet access service
occurs within the shortest possible time on the date and within the timeframe expressly agreed with the end-user. The
transferring provider shall continue to provide its internet access service on the same terms until the receiving provider
activates its internet access service. Loss of service during the switching process shall not exceed one working day.

National regulatory authorities shall ensure the efficiency and simplicity of the switching process for the end-user.

2.
Member States shall ensure that all end-users with numbers from the national numbering plan have the right to retain
their numbers, upon request, independently of the undertaking providing the service, in accordance with Part C of
Annex VI.

3.
Where an end-user terminates a contract, Member States shall ensure that the end-user can retain the right to port a
number from the national numbering plan to another provider for a minimum of one month after the date of termination,
unless that right is renounced by the end-user.

4.
National regulatory authorities shall ensure that pricing among providers related to the provision of number
portability is cost-oriented, and that no direct charges are applied to end-users.

5.
The porting of numbers and their subsequent activation shall be carried out within the shortest possible time on the
date explicitly agreed with the end-user. In any case, end-users who have concluded an agreement to port a number to a
new provider shall have that number activated within one working day from the date agreed with the end-user. In the case
of failure of the porting process, the transferring provider shall reactivate the number and related services of the end-user
until the porting is successful. The transferring provider shall continue to provide its services on the same terms and
conditions until the services of the receiving provider are activated. In any event, the loss of service during the process of
provider switching and the porting of numbers shall not exceed one working day. Operators whose access networks or
facilities are used by either the transferring or the receiving provider, or both, shall ensure that there is no loss of service
that would delay the switching and porting process.

6.
The receiving provider shall lead the switching and porting processes set out in paragraphs 1 and 5 and both the
receiving and transferring providers shall cooperate in good faith. They shall not delay or abuse the switching and porting
processes, nor shall they port numbers or switch end-users without the end-users’ explicit consent. The end-users’ contracts
with the transferring provider shall be terminated automatically upon conclusion of the switching process.

National regulatory authorities may establish the details of the switching and porting processes, taking into account
national provisions on contracts, technical feasibility and the need to maintain continuity of service to the end-users. This
shall include, where technically feasible, a requirement for the porting to be completed through over-the-air provisioning,
unless an end-user requests otherwise. National regulatory authorities shall also take appropriate measures ensuring that

17.12.2018

Member States shall promote the access to emergency services through the single European emergency number ‘112’ from
electronic communications networks which are not publicly available but which enable calls to public networks, in
particular when the undertaking responsible for that network does not provide an alternative and easy access to an
emergency service.

2.
Member States shall, after consulting national regulatory authorities and emergency services and providers of
electronic communications services, ensure that providers of publicly available number-based interpersonal communications services, where those services allow end-users to originate calls to a number in a national or international numbering
plan, provide access to emergency services through emergency communications to the most appropriate PSAP.

3.
Member States shall ensure that all emergency communications to the single European emergency number ‘112’ are
appropriately answered and handled in the manner best suited to the national organisation of emergency systems. Such
emergency communications shall be answered and handled at least as expeditiously and effectively as emergency
communications to the national emergency number or numbers, where those continue to be in use.

4.
By 21 December 2020 and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall submit a report to the
European Parliament and to the Council on the effectiveness of the implementation of the single European emergency
number ‘112’.

5.
Member States shall ensure that access for end-users with disabilities to emergency services is available through
emergency communications and is equivalent to that enjoyed by other end-users, in accordance with Union law
harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services. The Commission and the national regulatory or other
competent authorities shall take appropriate measures to ensure that, whilst travelling in another Member State, end-users
with disabilities can access emergency services on an equivalent basis with other end-users, where feasible without any preregistration. Those measures shall seek to ensure interoperability across Member States and shall be based, to the greatest
extent possible, on European standards or specifications laid down in accordance with Article 39. Such measures shall not
prevent Member States from adopting additional requirements in order to pursue the objectives set out in this Article.

6.
Member States shall ensure that caller location information is made available to the most appropriate PSAP without
delay after the emergency communication is set up. This shall include network-based location information and, where
available, handset-derived caller location information. Member States shall ensure that the establishment and the
transmission of the caller location information are free of charge for the end-user and the PSAP with regard to all
emergency communications to the single European emergency number ‘112’. Member States may extend that obligation to
cover emergency communications to national emergency numbers. Competent regulatory authorities, if necessary after
consulting BEREC, shall lay down criteria for the accuracy and reliability of the caller location information provided.

7.
Member States shall ensure that end-users are adequately informed about the existence and the use of the single
European emergency number ‘112’, as well as its accessibility features, including through initiatives specifically targeting
persons travelling between Member States and end-users with disabilities. That information shall be provided in accessible
formats, addressing different types of disabilities. The Commission shall support and complement Member States’ action.

8.
In order to ensure effective access to emergency services through emergency communications to the single European
emergency number ‘112’ in the Member States, the Commission shall, after consulting BEREC, adopt delegated acts in
accordance with Article 117 supplementing paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 of this Article on the measures necessary to ensure the
compatibility, interoperability, quality, reliability and continuity of emergency communications in the Union with regard to

Those delegated acts shall be adopted without prejudice to, and shall have no impact on, the organisation of emergency
services, which remains in the exclusive competence of Member States.

BEREC shall maintain a database of E.164 numbers of Member State emergency services to ensure that they are able to
contact each other from one Member State to another, if such a database is not maintained by another organisation.

Article 110
Public warning system

1.
By 21 June 2022, Member States shall ensure that, when public warning systems regarding imminent or developing
major emergencies and disasters are in place, public warnings are transmitted by providers of mobile number-based
interpersonal communications services to the end-users concerned.

2.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member States may determine that public warnings be transmitted through publicly
available electronic communications services other than those referred to in paragraph 1, and other than broadcasting
services, or through a mobile application relying on an internet access service, provided that the effectiveness of the public
warning system is equivalent in terms of coverage and capacity to reach end-users, including those only temporarily present
in the area concerned, taking utmost account of BEREC guidelines. Public warnings shall be easy for end-users to receive.

By 21 June 2020, and after consulting the authorities in charge of PSAPs, BEREC shall publish guidelines on how to assess
whether the effectiveness of public warning systems under this paragraph is equivalent to the effectiveness of those under
paragraph 1.

Article 111
Equivalent access and choice for end-users with disabilities

1.
Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities specify requirements to be met by providers of publicly
available electronic communications services to ensure that end-users with disabilities:

(a) have access to electronic communications services, including the related contractual information provided pursuant to
Article 102, equivalent to that enjoyed by the majority of end-users; and

(b) benefit from the choice of undertakings and services available to the majority of end-users.

2.
In taking the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States shall encourage compliance with the
relevant standards or specifications laid down in accordance with Article 39.

Article 112
Directory enquiry services

1.

numbers from a numbering plan meet all reasonable requests to make available, for the purposes of the provision of
publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, the relevant information in an agreed format, on terms which
are fair, objective, cost oriented and non-discriminatory.

2.
National regulatory authorities shall be empowered to impose obligations and conditions on undertakings that
control access to end-users, for the provision of directory enquiry services, in accordance with Article 61. Such obligations
and conditions shall be objective, equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent.

CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO DIGITAL TELEVISION AND RADIO SERVICES BROADCAST TO VIEWERS AND
LISTENERS IN THE UNION

Part I
Conditions for conditional access systems to be applied in accordance with Article 62(1)
In relation to conditional access to digital television and radio services broadcast to viewers and listeners in the Union,
irrespective of the means of transmission, Member States shall ensure in accordance with Article 62 that the following
conditions apply:
(a) all undertakings providing conditional access services, irrespective of the means of transmission, which provide access
services to digital television and radio services and the access services of which broadcasters depend on to reach any
group of potential viewers or listeners are to:
— offer to all broadcasters, on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis compatible with Union competition law,

ANNEX III
CRITERIA FOR THE DETERMINATION OF WHOLESALE VOICE TERMINATION RATES

Principles, criteria and parameters for the determination of rates for wholesale voice termination on fixed and mobile
markets referred to in Article 75(1):
(a) rates shall be based on the recovery of costs incurred by an efficient operator; the evaluation of efficient costs shall be
based on current cost values; the cost methodology to calculate efficient costs shall be based on a bottom-up modelling
approach using long-run incremental traffic-related costs of providing the wholesale voice termination service to third
parties;
(b) the relevant incremental costs of the wholesale voice termination service shall be determined by the difference between
the total long-run costs of an operator providing its full range of services and the total long-run costs of that operator
not providing a wholesale voice termination service to third parties;
(c) only those traffic-related costs which would be avoided in the absence of a wholesale voice termination service being
provided shall be allocated to the relevant termination increment;
(d) costs related to additional network capacity shall be included only to the extent that they are driven by the need to
increase capacity for the purpose of carrying additional wholesale voice termination traffic;
(e) radio spectrum fees shall be excluded from the mobile voice termination increment;
(f) only those wholesale commercial costs shall be included which are directly related to the provision of the wholesale
voice termination service to third parties;
(g) all fixed network operators shall be considered to provide voice termination services at the same unit costs as the
efficient operator, regardless of their size;
(h) for mobile network operators, the minimum efficient scale shall be set at a market share not below 20 %;
(i) the relevant approach for asset depreciation shall be economic depreciation; and
(j) the technology choice of the modelled networks shall be forward looking, based on an IP core network, taking into
account the various technologies likely to be used over the period of validity of the maximum rate; in the case of fixed
networks, calls shall be considered to be exclusively packet switched.

ANNEX IV
CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING CO-INVESTMENT OFFERS

When assessing a co-investment offer pursuant to Article 76(1), the national regulatory authority shall verify whether the
following criteria have at a minimum been met. National regulatory authorities may consider additional criteria to the
extent they are necessary to ensure accessibility of potential investors to the co-investment, in light of specific local
conditions and market structure:
(a) The co-investment offer shall be open to any undertaking over the lifetime of the network built under a co-investment
offer on a non-discriminatory basis. The undertaking designated as having significant market power may include in the
offer reasonable conditions regarding the financial capacity of any undertaking, so that for instance potential coinvestors need to demonstrate their ability to deliver phased payments on the basis of which the deployment is planned,
the acceptance of a strategic plan on the basis of which medium-term deployment plans are prepared, and so on.
(b) The co-investment offer shall be transparent:
— the offer shall be available and easily identified on the website of the undertaking designated as having significant
market power;
— full detailed terms shall be made available without undue delay to any potential bidder that has expressed an interest,
including the legal form of the co-investment agreement and, when relevant, the heads of term of the governance
rules of the co-investment vehicle; and
— the process, like the road map for the establishment and development of the co-investment project shall be set in
advance, shall be clearly explained in writing to any potential co-investor, and all significant milestones shall be
clearly communicated to all undertakings without any discrimination.
(c) The co-investment offer shall include terms to potential co-investors which favour sustainable competition in the long
term, in particular:
— All undertakings shall be offered fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for participation in
the co-investment agreement relative to the time they join, including in terms of financial consideration required for
the acquisition of specific rights, in terms of the protection awarded to the co-investors by those rights both during
the building phase and during the exploitation phase, for example by granting indefeasible rights of use (IRUs) for
the expected lifetime of the co-invested network and in terms of the conditions for joining and potentially
terminating the co-investment agreement. Non-discriminatory terms in this context do not entail that all potential
co-investors shall be offered exactly the same terms, including financial terms, but that all variations of the terms
offered shall be justified on the basis of the same objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable criteria
such as the number of end-user lines committed for.
— The offer shall allow flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the commitment provided by each co-investor,
for example by means of an agreed and potentially increasing percentage of the total end-user lines in a given area,
to which co-investors have the possibility to commit gradually and which is set at a unit level enabling smaller coinvestors with limited resources to enter the co-investment at a reasonably minimum scale and to gradually increase
their participation while ensuring adequate levels of initial commitment. The determination of the financial
consideration to be provided by each co-investor needs to reflect the fact that early investors accept greater risks and
engage capital sooner.
— A premium increasing over time shall be considered to be justified for commitments made at later stages and for
new co-investors entering the co-investment after the commencement of the project, to reflect diminishing risks
and to counteract any incentive to withhold capital in the earlier stages.
— The co-investment agreement shall allow the assignment of acquired rights by co-investors to other co-investors, or
to third parties willing to enter into the co-investment agreement subject to the transferee undertaking being obliged
to fulfil all original obligations of the transferor under the co-investment agreement.

17.12.2018

L 321/195

— Co-investors shall grant each other reciprocal rights on fair and reasonable terms and conditions to access the coinvested infrastructure for the purposes of providing services downstream, including to end-users, in accordance
with transparent conditions which are to be made transparent in the co-investment offer and subsequent agreement,
in particular where co-investors are individually and separately responsible for the deployment of specific parts of
the network. If a co-investment vehicle is created, it shall provide access to the network to all co-investors, whether
directly or indirectly, on an equivalence of inputs basis and in accordance with fair and reasonable terms and
conditions, including financial conditions that reflect the different levels of risk accepted by the individual coinvestors.
(d) The co-investment offer shall ensure a sustainable investment likely to meet future needs, by deploying new network
elements that contribute significantly to the deployment of very high capacity networks.

ANNEX VI
DESCRIPTION OF FACILITIES AND SERVICES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 88 (CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE),
ARTICLE 115 (ADDITIONAL FACILITIES) AND ARTICLE 106 (PROVIDER SWITCHING AND NUMBER PORTABILITY)

Part A
Facilities and services referred to in Articles 88 and 115
When applied on the basis of Article 88, Part A is applicable to consumers and other categories of end-users where
Member States have extended the beneficiaries of Article 88(2).
When applied on the basis of Article 115, Part A is applicable to the categories of end-users determined by Member States,
except for points (c), (d) and (g) of this Part which are applicable only to consumers.
(a) Itemised billing
Member States shall ensure that competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory
authorities, subject to the requirements of relevant law on the protection of personal data and privacy, may lay down
the basic level of itemised bills which are to be offered by providers to end-users free of charge in order that they can:
(i) allow verification and control of the charges incurred in using internet access services or voice communications
services, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 115; and
(ii) adequately monitor their usage and expenditure and thereby exercise a reasonable degree of control over their bills.
Where appropriate, additional levels of detail may be offered to end-users at reasonable tariffs or at no charge.
Such itemised bills shall include an explicit mention of the identity of the supplier and of the duration of the services
charged by any premium numbers unless the end-user has requested that information not to be mentioned.
Calls which are free of charge to the calling end-users, including calls to helplines, shall not be required to be identified
in the calling end-user’s itemised bill.
National regulatory authorities may require operators to provide calling-line identification free of charge.
(b) Selective barring for outgoing calls or premium SMS or MMS, or, where technically feasible, other kinds of similar
applications, free of charge
namely, the facility whereby the end-users can, on request to the providers of voice communications services, or
number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 115, bar outgoing calls or premium SMS or
MMS or other kinds of similar applications of defined types or to defined types of numbers free of charge.
(c) Pre-payment systems
Member States shall ensure that competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory
authorities may require providers to offer means for consumers to pay for access to the public electronic
communications network and use of voice communications services, or internet access services, or number-based
interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 115, on pre-paid terms.
(d) Phased payment of connection fees
Member States shall ensure that competent authorities in coordination, where relevant, with national regulatory
authorities may require providers to allow consumers to pay for connection to the public electronic communications
network on the basis of payments phased over time.
(e) Non-payment of bills
Member States shall authorise specified measures, which are to be proportionate, non-discriminatory and published, to
cover non-payment of bills issued by providers. Those measures are to ensure that due warning of any consequent
service interruption or disconnection is given to the end-users beforehand. Except in cases of fraud, persistent late
payment or non-payment, those measures shall ensure, as far as is technically feasible, that any service interruption is

L 321/198

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

17.12.2018

confined to the service concerned. Disconnection for non-payment of bills shall take place only after due warning is
given to the end-users. Member States may allow a period of limited service prior to complete disconnection, during
which only calls that do not incur a charge to the end-users (for example, calls to the ‘112’ number) and minimum
service level of internet access services, defined by Member States in light of national conditions, are permitted.
(f) Tariff advice
namely, the facility whereby end-users may request the provider to offer information regarding alternative lower-cost
tariffs, if available.
(g) Cost control
namely, the facility whereby providers offer other means, if determined to be appropriate by competent authorities in

an internet access service or a provider of a publicly available interpersonal communications service to charge for their
products or services.

Part B
Facilities referred to in Article 115
(a) Calling-line identification
namely, the calling party’s number is presented to the called party prior to the call being established.
This facility shall be provided in accordance with relevant law on protection of personal data and privacy, in particular
Directive 2002/58/EC.
To the extent technically feasible, operators shall provide data and signals to facilitate the offering of calling-line identity
and tone dialling across Member State boundaries.
(b) E-mail forwarding or access to e-mails after termination of the contract with a provider of an internet access service.
This facility shall, on request and free-of-charge, enable end-users who terminate their contract with a provider of an
internet access service to either access their e-mails received on the e-mail address(es) based on the commercial name or
trade mark of the former provider, during a period that the national regulatory authority considers necessary and
proportionate, or to transfer e-mails sent to that (or those) address(es) during that period to a new email address
specified by the end-user.

Part C
Implementation of the number portability provisions referred to in Article 106
The requirement that all end-users with numbers from the national numbering plan, who so request can retain their
numbers independently of the undertaking providing the service shall apply:

ANNEX VII
CALCULATING THE NET COST, IF ANY, OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND ESTABLISHING ANY
COMPENSATION OR SHARING MECHANISM IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 89 AND 90

Part A
Calculation of net cost
Universal service obligations refer to those obligations placed upon an undertaking by a Member State which concern the
provision of universal service as set out in Articles 84 to 87.
National regulatory authorities are to consider all means to ensure appropriate incentives for undertakings (designated or
not) to provide universal service obligations cost efficiently. In undertaking a calculation exercise, the net cost of universal
service obligations is to be calculated as the difference between the net cost for any undertaking operating with the
universal service obligations and operating without the universal service obligations. Due attention is to be given to
correctly assessing the costs that any undertaking would have chosen to avoid had there been no universal service
obligations. The net cost calculation shall assess the benefits, including intangible benefits, to the universal service provider.
The calculation is to be based upon the costs attributable to:
(i) elements of the identified services which can only be provided at a loss or provided under cost conditions falling outside
normal commercial standards.
This category may include service elements such as access to emergency telephone services, provision of certain public
pay telephones, provision of certain services or equipment for end-users with disabilities, and so on;
(ii) specific end-users or groups of end-users who, taking into account the cost of providing the specified network and
service, the revenue generated and any geographical averaging of prices imposed by the Member State, can only be
served at a loss or under cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards.
This category includes those end-users or groups of end-users which would not be served by a commercial provider
which did not have an obligation to provide universal service.
The calculation of the net cost of specific aspects of universal service obligations is to be made separately and in order to
avoid the double counting of any direct or indirect benefits and costs. The overall net cost of universal service obligations to
any undertaking is to be calculated as the sum of the net costs arising from the specific components of universal service
obligations, taking account of any intangible benefits. The responsibility for verifying the net cost lies with the national
regulatory authority.

Part B
Compensation of net costs of universal service obligations
The recovery or financing of any net costs of universal service obligations may require undertakings with universal service
obligations to be compensated for the services they provide under non-commercial conditions. Because such a
compensation involves financial transfers, Member States are to ensure that those are undertaken in an objective,
transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate manner. This means that the transfers result in the least distortion to
competition and to user demand.
In accordance with Article 90(3), a sharing mechanism based on a fund shall use a transparent and neutral means for
collecting contributions that avoids the danger of a double imposition of contributions falling on both outputs and inputs
of undertakings.
The independent body administering the fund is to be responsible for collecting contributions from undertakings which are
assessed as liable to contribute to the net cost of universal service obligations in the Member State and is to oversee the
transfer of sums due or administrative payments to the undertakings entitled to receive payments from the fund.
