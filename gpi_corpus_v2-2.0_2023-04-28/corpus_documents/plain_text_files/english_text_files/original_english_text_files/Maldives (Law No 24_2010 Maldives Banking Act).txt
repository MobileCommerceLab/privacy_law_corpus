This Act is enacted for the purposes of providing for

Maldives, a system for operating banks in Maldives,
policies for operating banks in a safe and prudent
manner, supervision of banks, appointment of
conservators and receivers, liquidation of banks, and
for other related purposes.

(b)

This Act shall be cited as “Maldives Banking Act”.

PART I
PROVISIONS RELATING TO LICENSING AND OPERATION OF
BANKS IN A PRUDENT MANNER
CHAPTER 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Objectives of the Act

Prohibitions

2.

3.

(a)

The primary objective of this Act is to set out banking
policies, and to ensure that the banking system
operates in accordance with such policies, in order to
achieve the following.
(1)

Maintain stability and public confidence in the
banking system.

(2)

Protect the rights of depositors and creditors of
the Bank.

(3)

Manage systemic risks.

(4)

Prevent financial crimes.

(5)

Foster competition in the Maldives banking
system, and ensure that the banking system is
responsive to the public’s needs for banking
services and able to contribute to economic
growth in the Maldives.

(b)

The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) shall be
responsible for enforcing and implementing this Act.

(a)

No person shall engage in the banking business in the
Maldives, advertise for deposits in the Maldives, or
engage in any of the activities listed in section 4 of
this Act as requiring a licence, unless they have a
licence issued by the MMA. The MMA is empowered

6

to grant exemptions to this requirement to the
following persons.
(1)

Based upon the size and nature of their
business, exemptions to the prohibitions stated
in paragraph (a) of this section may be granted
to such persons, in accordance with regulations
made under this Act. Such exemptions may be
conditional or limited as to time; and they may
be partial and list certain provisions of this Act
that shall apply to the beneficiaries of the
exemption notwithstanding the exemption.
Exemptions granted under this section may be
revoked or additional conditions imposed by
the MMA at any time.

(2)

Leasing companies may be exempted from this
prohibition by the MMA if it determines that
the businesses of such companies are subject to
prudential regulation under a separate legal
framework that adequately protects the public
interest. The MMA has the right to
subsequently impose additional conditions or
revoke any such exemption.

(b)

The MMA shall provide a written explanation
describing the basis for any exemptions that it may
grant under this section, which shall be published in
the Government Gazette.

(c)

No person shall use the word “bank” or related word
or derivatives of this word in Dhivehi or any other
language in connection with a business or service
unless they have a licence issued by the MMA
authorizing them to engage in the banking business.
The MMA shall be authorized, acting on a case-bycase basis, to grant exemptions to this prohibition in
cases where it determines that it is clear from the
context that the public is not likely to believe that
banking services are being offered or that they will
otherwise be injured by the proposed use of the word.

(d)

If the MMA determines that there are reasonable
grounds to suspect that any person engages in
activities that are prohibited under the preceding
provisions of this section, the MMA shall be
empowered to enter their offices and to examine their
accounts and books, or to direct that such items be
brought to it for inspection. Immediately upon the
request of the MMA, Maldives Police Service shall, if
necessary by the use of force, assist the MMA to gain
access to the premises of such person and to examine
their accounts and books; or to bring such materials to

7

the MMA for inspection.

an indefinite period of time and shall not be
transferable. The licence or its attachments shall
specify the conditions under which it is issued; and
compliance with all conditions of licensing, unless
such conditions are later modified, shall be a
continuing requirement applicable to all licensees.

sheets and profit and loss statements for the last
3 (three) years;

(2)

A description of the proposed capital funds of
the applicant, the sources of such funds and the
amount that has been paid in. The MMA may,

other depository approved by the MMA,
together with a certification that there is no
encumbrance on such funds.

(3)

The premises and the addresses at which the
applicant proposes to do business, and the
name under which the applicant intends to
conduct banking business.

The names, places of permanent residence,
business and professional backgrounds, and
other biographical and financial data to be
determined by the MMA, of each proposed
major shareholder and administrator of the
applicant.

an affidavit duly signed by the individual
stating any convictions for crimes or no

In the case of an application by a foreign bank
or bank holding company, or the subsidiary of
such foreign bank or bank holding company, a
statement from the foreign supervisory
authority responsible for the prudential
supervision of the foreign entity to the effect
that it has no objection to the proposed
establishment of operations in the Maldives by
the applicant. This statement also shall state
that it will exercise consolidated supervision
over the applicant.

In the case of an application by a bank holding
company or bank to organize a domestic bank, the
MMA shall, in addition to the information referred to
in paragraph (b) of this section, obtain detailed
financial and operational information regarding the
prospective licensee. This information shall also
include
information
concerning
the
major
shareholders and administrators of such bank or bank
holding company. The MMA may use this
information to determine the following.
(1)

That the ownership by the bank holding
company or bank will not weaken the
subsidiary bank but will bring financial and
managerial resources that will benefit the
domestic subsidiary bank; and

(2)

That the major shareholders and administrators
of the bank holding company or bank are fit
and proper persons.

Government Gazette, and add the bank to the Register
of Banks.

ISLAMIC BANKING
Licensing

9.

Subject to the licensing provisions of this Act, the MMA
may grant licences to establish domestic banks functioning
in accordance with Islamic principles or licences to open
branches and representative offices of foreign Islamic banks
in the Maldives. In addition, domestic banks not organized
as Islamic banks, and branches of foreign banks not
organized as Islamic banks, may, with the prior approval of
the MMA, offer banking services on an Islamic banking
basis through a department of the bank or otherwise. Such
banks and departments of banks shall be subject to
supervision, control, and examination by the MMA in the
same manner as other banks, except as otherwise provided
in this Act.

Banking activities on 10.
a non-interest basis

Islamic banks shall aim to provide banking services and
engage in financing and investment operations on a noninterest basis in all forms and cases.

Permissible activities

Islamic banks, and banks not organized as Islamic banks but
providing banking services on an Islamic banking basis,
may engage in consumer, commercial, financial, and
investment operations and participate in consumer,
commercial, economic development, and construction
projects, in connection with the provision of Islamic
banking services to customers, to the extent that
participation in such activities constitutes the functional
equivalent of traditional banking activities. The MMA shall
be authorized to provide guidance by regulation or
otherwise with regard to the conduct of Islamic banking
activities by licensees.

11.

CHAPTER 4
CAPITAL
Minimum capital of 12.
domestic banks, Tier I
banks and Tier II
banks

(a)

Domestic banks shall be established as Tier I or as
Tier II banks, with the capital specified in Rufiyaa,
paid in unencumbered cash, and in the manner
prescribed by this section.

14

(1)

A Tier I bank shall at all times maintain a
minimum unimpaired paid-up capital of not
less than 150,000,000/- (one hundred and fifty
million) Rufiyaa, or such higher amount as
may be specified by the MMA. A Tier I bank
may engage in the banking activities specified
in section 25 of this Act, provided however,
that it shall comply with the procedure
described in paragraph (b) of section 25 with
respect to engaging in the activities listed there.

(2)

A Tier II bank shall at all times maintain a
minimum unimpaired paid-up capital of not
less than 60,000,000/- (sixty million) Rufiyaa,
or such higher amount as may be specified by
the MMA. A Tier II bank shall engage only in
the deposit-taking activities described in
subparagraph (a) (1) of this section 25, and in
consumer, retail and residential mortgage
lending activities, as may be authorised by the
MMA.

(b)

Except as otherwise provided in this Act, Tier I banks
and Tier II banks shall comply with all of the
provisions of this Act applicable to banks. A Tier II
bank having unimpaired paid-up capital in the
minimum amount described in subparagraph (a) (1) of
this section or such higher amount as the MMA may
specify, and meeting all requirements applicable to
the organization of a bank, may seek authority from
the MMA to be licensed as a Tier I bank. The MMA
may determine the procedures pursuant to which such
applications shall be determined.

(c)

A bank may declare dividends from actual profits
derived from the past year’s operations, after
adjustments required under this Act and regulations of
the MMA have been made. However, dividends may
be declared from profits retained from prior years’
operations, only with the approval of the MMA. No
bank may declare or pay any cash dividends, make
any payment to shareholders, or make any transfer of
profits, if such transfer or payment will result in a
reduction of its capital or reserves below the
minimum levels required under this Act or as required
by regulation or order of the MMA.

(d)

A bank shall allocate, after taxes, at least 50% (fifty
percent) of its net, distributable profits for the
formation of a capital reserve until the reserve totals
50% (fifty percent) of its paid-up capital. Once the
reserve reaches 50 percent of the bank’s paid-up

15

capital, the allocation shall not be less than 25%
(twenty five percent) of the bank’s net, distributable
profit until the reserve totals an amount equal to the
bank’s paid-up capital. A bank may not reduce its
capital and the reserve accumulated in the manner
described in this section or in any other manner
without the MMA’s prior approval.

Assigned

adequacy 14.
requirements

(e)

A bank shall obtain the approval of the MMA prior to
issuing or retiring whole or part of subordinated debt
or repayment of the principal or interest.

(a)

A foreign bank operating in the Maldives shall be
required to maintain equity capital allocated to its
operations in the Maldives in an amount equal to the
minimum level of paid-up capital required for the
operation of a domestic bank. This allocation of
capital shall be referred to as “assigned capital”. If the
branch of a foreign bank intends to conduct
operations in the manner of a Tier I bank, then the
amount specified for unimpaired paid-up capital for
Tier I banks shall be maintained as assigned capital of
such branch. If the branch of a foreign bank intends to
conduct operations as a Tier II bank, then the amount
specified as unimpaired paid-up capital for Tier II
banks shall be maintained as assigned capital of such
branch. Transfers shall be made from profits of the
branch to the reserve account to augment assigned
capital in the manner described in paragraph (d) of
section 12 of this Act. Assigned capital shall be
maintained in the manner described in guidelines
issued by the MMA.

(b)

Each branch of a foreign bank operating in the
Maldives, if so directed by the MMA, shall maintain
in the Maldives an excess of assets over its liabilities
in such amount, if any, as the MMA may stipulate.

(c)

The determination of prudential ratios of the domestic
branch of a foreign bank, including but not limited to
capital adequacy and those matters set forth in
Chapter 6 of this Act, shall be based on the assigned
capital of such branches.

(a)

Each bank shall at all times maintain total capital of
not less than 12% (twelve percent) of the total value
of its assets determined on a risk-adjusted basis, core
capital of not less than 6% (six percent) of riskadjusted assets; and capital of not less than 5% (five
percent) of gross assets. The MMA shall, acting
consistently with international standards, define in
regulations the meaning of capital, core capital,
capital base and other terms and specify categories of

16

risk assets. The MMA shall also, in its discretion, be
authorized to specify higher capital ratios than those
listed in this section.
(b)

The amount of any holding of capital in another bank
shall be deducted from the bank’s capital for purposes
of calculating the capital ratios pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this section.

(c)

The MMA shall specify by regulation principles for
establishing and holding a bank’s paid-up minimum
capital.

(d)

The MMA shall be authorized to order individual
banks to hold higher capital ratios than the generally
applicable levels, should the MMA determine that the
operations and financial condition of such banks
warrant the imposition of such higher capital levels.

The MMA shall be authorized, in its discretion, to
direct a bank to deduct any lending to a related person
from its capital for purposes of calculating the ratio
pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 14 of this Act,
and impose on a bank the condition that any loans
made by it to related persons shall be fully secured by
readily marketable collateral, as those terms may be
defined by the MMA.

(e)

Any purchase or lease of asset by a bank from a
related person, and any provison of services by a
related person to a bank, shall, in accordance with
regulations to be adopted by the MMA be approved in
advance by a vote of the board of directors or by the
designated branch manager, as described in
subparagraph (a) (1) of this section, and accomplished
on terms that are no less favourable to the bank than
those under which similar transactions between the
bank and unrelated persons would be accomplished.

The MMA may issue regulations setting limits on the
foreign currency exposures that banks may incur in foreign
currencies generally or in specified currencies.
(a)

Except as provided in this section, banks may not
invest in companies engaged in commercial or
industrial activities. However, this shall not prohibit
Islamic banks, or banks providing financing on an
Islamic basis, from providing such financing in
accordance with regulations issued and guidance
provided by the MMA.

(b)

Banks may not invest in the stocks, bonds, shares or
equity-linked bonds of any company in an amount
that exceeds 15% (fifteen percent) of the bank’s
capital. Such investments, in the case of a company
engaged in activities other than banking activities,
shall not exceed 5% (five percent) of the voting
interests in the company.

(c)

Banks may not acquire ownership interests in other
banks or financial institutions, in excess of 5% (five
percent) of the voting interests in such other
institutions, without first obtaining the prior approval
of the MMA for such acquisition.

(d)

Banks may not acquire real estate or retain legal title
of real estate except for the purposes stated below:
(1)

to accommodate their own operations and to
provide housing for employees;

32

(e)

(2)

to acquire real estate required to provide
Islamic banking services in accordance with
any regulations issued and guidance provided
by the MMA; and

(3)

real estate held temporarily during the course
of realizing on collateral for loans.

Banks shall dispose any investment made against any
ownership interests in companies or financial
institutions in excess of the limitations provided in
this section acquired in the course of their banking
business, within 6 (six) months after such interests
were acquired, unless the MMA, for good cause
shown, extends the permitted holding period for
additional time not to exceed 6 (six) more months.
Any interests in real estate acquired in the course of
banking operations beyond the limitations of this
section shall be disposed of within 2 (two) years after
such interests were acquired, unless the MMA, for
good cause shown, extends the permitted holding
period for additional time not to exceed 2 (two) more
years.

Bank holidays

32.

All banks shall open their doors for business with the public
on all days and during all office hours set by the MMA,
excluding those days determined by the MMA to be bank
holidays. MMA may authorize a bank to open for business
with the public on days and hours outside of the minimums
set by the MMA, and except with such authorization by the
MMA, no bank shall open its doors for business with the
public during bank holidays determined by the MMA. In
the event that circumstances require the suspension of
banking operations, the MMA may allow or order a bank to
close their doors temporarily, cease their operations, and
resume them on a date specified by the MMA.

Suspicious
transactions

No bank may grant credit or provide a guarantee to a
customer that uses the customers’ shares in the bank as
collateral to secure the loan. A bank may not repurchase its
own shares without first obtaining the prior approval of the
MMA. However, a bank may take its own shares as security
to avoid a loss on a debt previously contracted and shall
thereafter dispose of such shares in accordance with
regulations issued by the MMA. Shares held and loans
secured by shares of a bank shall be deducted from capital
for purposes of calculating minimum capital requirements
and capital adequacy ratios.

Any bank account that has had no transactions or written
communications relating to it for a period of 5 (five) years
shall be determined as a dormant account, and the bank
shall be subject to the following rules in dealing with such
an account. However, this Section does not restrict the
banks from establishing their own policies in the treatment
of accounts that have had no transactions or written
communications relating to it for a duration less than 5
(five) years, to the extent that such treatment does not
conflict with the provisions of this Act.
(a)

If an account holder has not conducted a transaction
from the account or written correspondence with the
bank for 5 (five) years, on the first business day of the
following calendar year the bank shall dispatch by
registered post a notice to the account holder at his
last known address containing particulars of the
dormant account. The bank shall publish in at least 1
(one) local newspaper and in the Government Gazette
the names of account holders that do not respond to
the letter. Not less than 60 (sixty) days after such
notice and publication, if the account holder cannot be
located, the bank shall make a detailed report to the
MMA and shall turn over the amount on deposit to
the MMA, to be held in a special account at the
MMA.

(b)

The MMA shall hold the funds in a special account to
be invested in government securities. However, for a
period of 5 (five) years any owner who, to the
satisfaction of the MMA furnishes proof of
ownership, shall be entitled to the repayment of the
amounts by the MMA. After expiration of such
period, any remaining unclaimed amounts shall be
transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury.
However, the owner shall still be entitled at any
subsequent time to claim the funds from the Ministry
of Finance and Treasury upon providing evidence,
satisfactory to the MMA, of entitlement to such funds.

Banks shall keep on file in the Maldives, for such
period of time as is required by law or as the MMA

retain books, records, statements, documents,
correspondence, cables, notices, and other documents
relating to its financial activities in reduced form such
as microfilm, electronic data storage or other current
technological devices instead of the original for the
period established in the law, to the extent that
adequate data management and recovery systems and
procedures are in place. Such reduced copies shall
have the probative effect of the original and shall be
accepted in the Court as evidence. The MMA may
issue regulations setting out detailed systems
requirements for record keeping.

(a)

Banks or MMA may establish cooperative systems,
payment systems, settlement systems and clearing
systems for the transfer of funds and for the
settlement of accounts and to make payments among
the banks and other financial institutions. The MMA
may establish regulations and procedures to govern
the conduct of these activities. A bank shall
participate in any such system established by MMA if
instructed to do so by the MMA.

(b)

Banks may establish credit information exchange
agencies or credit bureaus to collect and to
disseminate to other banks such information
concerning the financial status of existing and
prospective customers as the banks may need in order
to make prudent banking decisions. Banks shall
participate in any such credit bureau or agency MMA
may establish. Such information shall be furnished
only to banks and such other persons, if any, as may
be designated in a regulation issued by the MMA who
have an actual or prospective banking or business
relationship with the person concerning whom the
information is provided. Such information shall be
furnished subject to regulations that may be adopted
by the MMA under subparagraph (c) (5) of section 66
of this Act, as shall be necessary to protect the
confidentiality of banking information and to prevent
the unauthorized dissemination of such information.

Banking secrecy and professional privilege, including the
provisions relating to banking confidentiality set forth in
section 41 of this Act, shall not be invoked as a ground for
non-compliance with the obligations to provide any report
of suspicious transactions, or information, or reports set

Terrorism Act.

The external auditor shall not provide services to the
bank that are related to the internal audit function of
the bank nor shall he provide services on which the
external auditor would be expected to give an opinion
as a result of an external audit, except occasionally for
training purposes. In the event that the bank should
need assistance in maintaining proper accounting
systems and procedures, or in establishing proper
financial control and risk management systems and
procedures, such assistance shall be provided by
auditors other than the bank’s external auditor, except
when directed by the MMA pursuant to subparagraph

No bank shall appoint the same external audit firm
continuously for a period of more than 4 (four) years

audit the bank’s operations on a consolidated basis
and:
(1)

issue a statement to the bank indicating
whether the auditor, and all members of the
audit firm, comply with the provisions of
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section;

(2)

within 3 (three) months after the end of the

directors of the bank an audit report together
with an audit opinion stating whether the
financial statements are complete, fair and
properly drawn up and present a full and fair
view of the financial condition of the bank in
accordance with this Act and applicable
accounting standards. A copy of this audit
report, together with any accompanying letter
to management, shall be sent by the auditor
directly to the MMA. In particular, the audit
report shall state:
(a)

whether any explanation or information
called for from the administrators,
employees or agents of the bank in the
course of the audit was satisfactory or
materially deficient;

(b)

whether the bank maintains internal
controls designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of:

41

-

financial reporting;

the

preparation

of

financial

statements in accordance with
applicable accounting standards;
-

the safeguarding of assets of the
bank;

-

the adherence to applicable laws
and regulations, including this
Act;

-

risk management policies and
procedures of the bank;

-

systems for the prevention of
money laundering and financing
of terrorism.

(c)

whether the bank maintains a loan review
and provisioning process designed to
produce an accurate loan grading system
and loan loss provisions that are adequate,
with reference to regulatory requirements
prescribed by MMA and to the actual risk
of loss based on current and foreseeable
conditions;

(d)

whether the bank maintains proper books
of account and whether the bank’s
financial statements are in agreement with
said books; and

the auditor’s recommendations and
remarks made in connection to operations
and management in previous years.

(3)

inform each member of the board of directors
and the MMA about any act by an
administrator, officer, employee or agent of the
bank of which the external auditor has become
aware, or has reason to believe, may constitute
fraudulent activity, a violation of this Act or of
any regulation or order issued by the MMA;

(4)

inform each member of the board of directors
and the MMA about any irregularity or
deficiency in the bank’s administration or
operations of which the external auditor has
become aware and which could be expected to
result in a material loss for the bank; and

(5)

inform each member of the board of directors
and the MMA about any conditions or trends in
the bank’s operations, not amounting to
fraudulent activity, or violation of law,

42

regulation or order, or irregularity or deficiency
in administration or operations, as described in
subparagraphs (3) and (4) above, but that
nonetheless could jeopardize the solvency or
liquidity of the bank and are therefore of
supervisory concern.

laws and notice to
MMA of intent to
discharge auditor

including the accompanying letter from the auditor to
management of the bank, to the MMA not later than
30 (thirty) days after it becomes available, and in no
event later than 4 (four) months after the end of the
financial year. In the event that the MMA is not
satisfied with the audit report, it may require the
appointment of another auditor to prepare a new audit
report within a specified time at the expense of the
bank.

(a)

The MMA may impose on an auditor, in addition to
any duty specified in section 49 of this Act, the duty
to:

implemented in accordance with such
regulations, directions and guidelines issued by
the MMA.

(b)

The auditor’s costs for performing any such additional
duties imposed by the MMA shall be borne by the
bank.

(a)

The provisions of the Law No. 10/96 (Companies Act
of the Maldives) shall apply to bank auditors unless
stipulated otherwise in this Act.

Auditors shall observe professional and banking
confidentiality requirements, provided, however, that
the auditor shall not incur criminal or civil liability for
the disclosure of confidential information concerning
a bank or a bank customer which the auditor provides
in good faith to the MMA under this Act. In

43

particular, a report by the auditor to the MMA
pursuant to paragraph (f) of section 49 shall not be
construed as a breach of professional or banking
confidentiality obligations.
(c)

A bank shall provide prior notice to the MMA of its
intent to discharge its auditor or audit firm, and state
the reasons for its intended action. In the event that
the MMA finds such reasons to be insufficient, it may
order the auditor or audit firm to be retained or
reinstated.

(e)

Bank examiners shall prepare a report based on the
results of the examination and shall submit the report
to the MMA and to the board of directors of the bank.

(a)

The MMA may exchange information on supervisory
matters, whether based on a memorandum of
understanding or not, with banking supervisory
authorities in other countries. The exchange of such

44

information may include confidential information,

violations. In this case, one or more
representatives of the MMA shall attend the
Board of Directors meeting;

(11)

require the bank to hire, for a period of time
and under conditions to be specified by the
MMA, an advisor who shall have authority to
make decisions or disapprove actions proposed
to be taken by the bank regarding the sale,
disposition or transfer of the bank’s assets, the
loan or investment of the bank’s funds, the
undertaking of any debt, obligation or liability,

46

and the payment of dividends;

(c)

(12)

require that the bank temporarily or
permanently remove from office the managing
director, any other executive officer or the
designated branch manager, depending on the
seriousness of the violation stipulated in
subparagraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section;

(13)

require that the bank remove the chairman or
any of the members of the bank’s board of
directors;

(14)

dissolve the bank’s board of directors and
appoint a conservator in accordance with
section 70 of this Act to assume responsibility
for managing the bank;

(15)

impose an administrative penalty on the bank,
provided that, at the discretion of the MMA,
administrative penalties may be imposed on a
daily basis until the violation has eased or
compliance is obtained. Such administrative
penalties shall be of an amount between
10,000/- (ten thousand) Rufiyaa and 100,000/(one hundred thousand) Rufiyaa on a daily
basis.
However,
the
total
aggregate
administrative penalty imposed shall not
exceed 5 % (five percent) of the bank’s paid-up
capital;

(16)

impose an administrative penalty on one or
more administrators of the bank in the event
that the MMA determines that such
administrators are responsible for the existence
of the violations stipulated in subparagraphs (a)
(1) and (2) of this section; or

(17)

revoke the bank’s licence.

The MMA shall have the power to remove an
administrator, manager, or other employee of a bank
from office or employment in, or prohibit a major
shareholder or other persons from participating in the
affairs of a bank or other entity subject to supervision
by the MMA under this Act if the MMA determines
that:
(1)

the person intentionally committed or
participated in the commission of an act
referred to in subparagraphs (a) (1) and (2) of
this section, or intentionally violated an order
of the MMA issued in response to the same or
a similar act, and

47

(d)

(2)

as a result of an act referred to in
subparagraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section,
the bank has suffered, or will likely suffer,
financial loss or other damage, or the person
has received financial gain or other benefit as a
result of the commission of such an act, and

(3)

the commission of an act referred to in
subparagraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section
involves personal dishonesty on the part of the
person, or demonstrates a wilful or continuing
disregard for the safety and soundness of the
bank.

(1)

The MMA may impose an administrative
penalty on a bank, in the following cases of an
amount between 10,000/- (ten thousand)
Rufiyaa and 100,000/- (one hundred thousand)
Rufiyaa per day until the violation has ceased
or compliance is obtained. However, the total
aggregate administrative penalty imposed shall
not exceed 5% (five percent) of the bank’s
paid-up capital.
(a)

The bank’s submission to the MMA
materially deficient or false statements,
statistics, or information that is,
intentionally or negligently; or

(b)

The bank’s failure to provide the MMA
with information in its possession that is
requested by MMA.

The imposition of the administrative penalty
stipulated in subparagraph (d)(1) of this section
shall not bar the MMA or other aggrieved party
from demanding compensation from the bank
in violation for damages arising from the
incorrectness of the information and statements
mentioned in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this
paragraph (d) (1) of this section.
(2)

(e)

The MMA shall establish, and revise from time
to time, a schedule showing the amounts of
administrative penalties that may be imposed
for various categories of offences or violations.
The amounts of such penalties may be stated in
ranges. The size of an actual penalty may be
determined based on the offence or violation,
and the steps taken to mitigate the loss caused.

When the MMA decides that an order to cease and
desist shall be given to a bank pursuant to this section,
or that administrative penalties should be assessed on
a bank or on an administrator of a bank, or that it has
grounds to remove an administrator under this

48

section, then the MMA shall serve on the bank or
administrator, as the case may be a notice of charges,
including a statement of the facts constituting the
alleged violation or threat of violation; describing the
order or administrative penalties that the MMA
proposes to issue or impose, or stating the reasons
why the MMA believes that removal of an
administrator is warranted; and requesting that a
written response be provided by the bank or
administrator within 30 (thirty) days after the date of
service of such notice. If so requested by the bank or
the administrator in its written response, the MMA
shall schedule a hearing for a date not later than 30
(thirty) days after the date of service of such notice on
the bank, or 15 (fifteen) days after receipt by the
MMA of the bank’s or the administrator’s, as the case
may be written response to such notice, whichever is
later. The hearing shall be held by an appropriately
qualified person appointed by the MMA for such
purpose. Within 30 (thirty) days after the conclusion
of the hearing, the MMA shall decide whether or not
to issue an order or to assess the administrative
penalties. Any order or assessment of penalties shall
be accompanied by the reasons supporting the
issuance of such order or the assessment of such
penalties. A bank or administrator aggrieved by the
issuance of a cease and desist order, a removal order,
or the assessment of penalties under this section may
obtain judicial review of the decision of the MMA, as
is provided for in section 67 of this Act.
(f)

if MMA reasonably believes that in case where an
immediate action is not taken, an irreversible loss
maybe immediately incurred to the bank, the
depositors or creditors and the shareholders of the
bank, MMA may issue a cease and desist order or an
order for the removal of an administrator to the bank,
without service of notice and without conducting a
hearing as per paragraph (e) of this section. The bank
shall comply with such an order immediately upon
receipt of the order.

(g)

The imposition by the MMA of measures or
administrative penalties stipulated in this section shall
not bar any civil or criminal accountability under any
other law.

(h)

In the event that administrative penalties assessed by
the MMA pursuant to this section are not paid by the
bank or the administrator within 30 (thirty) days
following the date on which they are assessed, the
MMA shall be authorized to take the following
actions:

49

(1)

order that additional penalties, in the amount
determined by the MMA, shall accrue on a
daily basis until the entire amount is paid, and

(2)

commence an action in the Court against the
bank or the administrator, as the case may be,
to obtain payment.

The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the
domestic branch offices and domestic representative
offices in the Maldives of a foreign bank as if all these
offices together were to form a single legal entity. All
assets, liabilities, acts and omissions of the foreign
bank resulting from or otherwise relating to the
business of any such office shall be attributed to that
single entity in applying the provisions of this
Chapter. The conservator of a foreign bank shall be
authorized to take all actions with respect to such
foreign bank, as could be taken by the authorized
manager or by shareholders at the general meeting of
shareholders of a domestic bank.

(a)

Conservators shall be appointed by decision of the
MMA. Only fit and proper persons are eligible to

Conservators shall be appointed for a term, not
exceeding 12 (twelve) months, as specified in the

(a)

The decision of the MMA appointing a conservator
for a bank takes effect immediately, unless the
decision provides otherwise.

(b)

The decision of the MMA appointing a conservator
for a bank suspends the powers of the shareholders to
take action at the general meeting of shareholders of

55

the bank. Thereafter, the conservator shall have the
power to take all of the actions in the ordinary course
of business including those that could be taken at the
general meeting of shareholders of the bank, such as
the sale and disposition of assets and such other
actions as may be necessary to place the bank in a
safe and solvent condition. However, a transaction
involving recapitalisation with new investors, the

conditions that have been approved by the Court on
recommendation of the MMA.

The decision of the MMA appointing a conservator
for a bank shall suspend the powers of the board of

otherwise in a written notice to the conservator. In the
absence or inability of the conservator to act, the
MMA may exercise the powers of the conservator.

Actions taken by or on behalf of a bank after a
conservator is appointed for that bank, shall be null
and void. However, actions taken by or by the

Notwithstanding any requirements set forth in section
12 this Act, the MMA, in its sole discretion, may
organize and licence a bridge bank which will be
owned and fully controlled by the MMA, to receive
any assets and liabilities of one or more banks as to
which a conservator under Chapter 14 or a receiver
under Chapter 17 has been appointed. A bridge bank
may be placed under the control of a conservator or
receiver and shall terminate its operations at the end
of a 1 (one) year period following the issuance of a
licence, except that the MMA, in its discretion, may
extend its status for two additional 1 (one) year terms.

dissipation of such assets by theft or other improper
action.

(b)

The conservator shall have unrestricted access to and
control over the assets, the offices, and the books,
records and other documents, of the bank for which

of a conservator, law enforcement officials shall, if
necessary by use of force, assist the conservator to
gain access to the premises of the bank for which the
conservator has been appointed and to gain control
over and to secure the aforementioned. The decision
of the MMA appointing the conservator shall have the
legal force and effect of an enforceable court order
requiring law enforcement authorities to provide such
assistance.

A conservator may employ at the expense of the bank
for which the conservator has been appointed, such
independent
specialists,
including
attorneys,
accountants and consultants, on such terms as the
MMA shall approve.

(a)

Within 5 (five) days from the date of service of the
decision appointing the conservator for a bank, the
board of directors of the bank may make written
representations on behalf of the bank to the MMA
challenging the appointment of the conservator. In the
event that the board of directors waives its right to
challenge, or if no such challenge is made within the 5
(five) day time period referred to above, the bank
shall be deemed to have consented to the decision
appointing the conservator.

(b)

Upon the timely receipt of such a challenge, the
MMA shall review the appointment of the conservator
in light of the arguments made against it and decide

57

either to affirm the appointment or to terminate the
appointment, giving the grounds for its decision. The
decision of the MMA shall be served promptly upon
the chairman of the board of directors of the bank.

that is not a decision to which the bank has consented,
and any decision of the MMA affirming the
appointment of a conservator under paragraph (b) of
this section, may be submitted by the bank, or any
administrator, creditor, depositor or shareholder of the
bank to the Court for review within 30 (thirty) days
from the date of service of the decision on the bank.
The appointment and powers of the conservator shall
stay in full force and effect until a final decision is
taken by the Court.

(a)

No later than 30 (thirty) days after the appointment or
within the period MMA may have extended, the
conservator shall prepare and present to the MMA a
report on the financial condition and future prospects
of the bank for which the conservator has been
appointed. The conservator shall include in the report
an assessment of the amount of assets likely to be
realized in a liquidation of the bank. The report may
be prepared with the assistance of independent experts
as the conservator may determine in accordance with
paragraph (c) of section 73 of this Act.

(b)

The report specified in paragraph (a) of this section
shall be accompanied by a proposed plan of action,
that shall include the relative costs and benefits

other than deposits and investments in segregated fiduciary
accounts, to be totally or partially blocked for a maximum
period of 3 (three) months, provided that measures are taken
which, in the opinion of the MMA, will preserve the
approximate value of these deposits and investments
together with interest accrued before and during the
moratorium. In extraordinary cases, the conservator, with
the approval of the MMA, may permit the withdrawal of
some or all of the deposits held in the name of a natural
person not to exceed 50% (fifty percent) of total deposit and

CHAPTER 15
RECAPITALIZATION
Recapitalization
procedures

78.

(a)

A bank may be recapitalized using public funds by the
conservator appointed for the bank, under supervision
of the MMA, if the Minister of Finance and Treasury
decides, upon the recommendation of the MMA, that
the stability of the banking system of the Maldives
requires the recapitalization of the bank. Once the
Minister of Finance and Treasury has taken a decision
to recapitalize a bank, then the Minister may authorize
or make available financing in connection with the

59

transactions, costs and expenses referred to in
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(b)

The recommendation of the MMA to recapitalize a
bank using public funds shall be accompanied by a
recapitalization plan prepared by the MMA in
consultation with the conservator. The plan shall
identify the existing weaknesses in the administration
or operations of the bank, determine the corrective
measures required to remedy such weaknesses, and
provide a timetable and financing plan for the
proposed rehabilitation. The plan shall review and
evaluate strategies for transferring the core business
of the bank to another bank through one or more of
the transactions authorized by section 95 of this Act
and shall to the extent practicable preclude the
enrichment of shareholders at the expense of the
State. At any time during the execution of the plan,
the Minister of Finance and Treasury, after having
consulted the MMA, may:
(1)

terminate the rehabilitation plan; or

(2)

request the MMA to revoke the licence of the
bank if grounds for licence revocation exist
under section 55 of this Act; or

(3)

request the MMA to submit a petition to the
Court for the institution of bankruptcy
proceedings under section 83 of this Act.

(c)

For the purpose of conserving the assets and
managing the business of a bank under rehabilitation
on a going concern basis, the MMA may direct the
conservator to transfer all or part of the assets and
liabilities of the bank to a bridge bank established and
capitalized by the state and holding a banking licence
issued by the MMA. This transfer shall become
effective immediately. If some obligations of the bank
to creditors would be excluded from such a transfer,
the conservator shall take the interests of such
creditors into account. Such a transfer shall not
require the consent of the bank or any of its governing
bodies. The transfer of liabilities shall be published by
notice in the Government Gazette and in a newspaper
of general circulation designated by the MMA.

(d)

Upon the request of the conservator made in
accordance with the rehabilitation plan, and with the
concurrence of the Minister of Finance and Treasury
where appropriate, the MMA may:
(1)

authorize the conservator for the bank to carry
out one or more of the transactions authorized
by section 95 of this Act, which may include
financing provided by the State in the form of

60

deposits, loans, grants, the provision of
guarantees or infusion of capital;

(e)

(2)

order an increase in the authorized capital of
the bank or the issue of shares of capital stock
of the bank on such terms and conditions as the
MMA may determine; or

(3)

authorize the conservator to terminate all or
some current contracts of the bank for the
delivery of goods or services by analogous
application of the provisions of section 100 of
this Act. The costs of resolving any claims
resulting from termination of contracts may be
submitted to the MMA and treated as a cost of
rehabilitation of the bank.

The costs incurred on account of rehabilitation of a
bank shall be charged to the bank, and, to the extent
that the resources of the bank shall prove insufficient,
to the State.

CHAPTER 16
LIQUIDATION OF BANKS
Voluntary liquidation

Forced liquidation

79.

80.

(a)

A bank may be liquidated by the decision of its
shareholders after the voluntary termination of
operations has been approved by the MMA and the
licence has been revoked. The liquidation shall be
carried out by the bank, in compliance with the rules
specified or referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of
section 80 of this Act and under supervision of the
MMA.

(b)

The bank shall provide the MMA with such
documents and information as the MMA shall request
and shall grant the staff of the MMA access to the
buildings, books and records of the bank whenever
the MMA decides that such access is required to
discharge its supervisory responsibilities.

(c)

If the MMA determines that the bank does not ensure
an orderly liquidation or if the bank fails to comply
with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section,
the MMA shall appoint a receiver who shall carry out
or complete the liquidation of the bank under the
supervision of the MMA.

(a)

The decision of the MMA taken pursuant to section
55 of this Act to revoke the banking licence of a bank
against which no bankruptcy proceedings have been
opened, must provide for the liquidation of the bank
in accordance with the procedures prescribed by this
section by a receiver appointed for the bank by the
MMA. The MMA shall arrange for the prompt

61

publication of the decision by notice in the
Government Gazette and in a newspaper of general
circulation.
(b)

From the time of the decision of the MMA to revoke
the banking licence of a bank and to liquidate a bank:
(1)

acts performed by or on behalf of the bank are
legally void and unenforceable, except for acts
performed by or by authority of the receiver for
the bank, acts deemed beneficial to the bank by
the receiver and ratified by the receiver, and
money and securities transfer orders covered
by section 94 of this Act;

(2)

all restraints on the disposition of bank assets
and liens in aide of execution in favour of the
bank’s creditors or other restraints on the
bank’s assets shall be deemed removed by
operation of law;

(3)

the assets of the bank shall be immune from
attachment and execution, except for assets
encumbered by a mortgage or lien to the extent
of the debt secured by such encumbrance; and

(4)

no bankruptcy proceeding may be commenced
against the bank.

(c)

The liquidation shall be carried out by the receiver
under supervision of the MMA, in accordance with
procedures that are consistent with those set forth in
section 96 up to and including section 109 of this Act.

(d)

Upon the request of the receiver, the MMA may
authorize a bank to carry out one or more of the
transactions stated in section 95 of this Act.

(e)

The provisions of this section shall apply to the
domestic branch offices and domestic representative
offices of a foreign bank as if all these domestic
branch offices and domestic representative offices
together were to form a single legal entity. All assets,
liabilities, acts and omissions of domestic branches
and domestic representative offices of a foreign bank
shall be attributed to that single entity in applying the
provisions of this section. The receiver shall be
authorized to take all actions with respect to such
single entity as could be taken, were it to be a
domestic bank, by the authorized manager or by
shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.

(a)

the bank is not paying its financial obligations,
including deposit liabilities, as they fall due, and no
liquidity support acceptable to the MMA is available;

(b)

the core capital of the bank is less than 2% (two
percent) of the gross assets of the bank, and no
recapitalization plan acceptable to the MMA is
available; or

(c)

the bank is no longer viable, and the MMA
determines that that no realistic means exists, to return
the bank to a viable condition within a reasonable
time.

The MMA shall have sole authority and discretion to
determine whether a bank is bankrupt as provided in this
section, subject to judicial review of its decision by the
Court as provided in section 67.

proceedings

(a)

Petitions for opening bankruptcy proceedings against

against a bank may be granted by the Court only if the
following are satisfied:
(1)

the petition is presented by the MMA, together
with financial statements of the bank certified
by the MMA, showing the basis on which one
or more applicable statutory grounds for

served on the MMA by three or more creditors
of the bank with obligations aggregating more
than 10,000,000/- (ten million) Rufiyaa or

Grounds for rejecting 86.
the petition

As soon as a petition for opening bankruptcy proceedings
against a bank has been served on the MMA by creditors of
the bank under subparagraph (b) (2) of section 83 of this
Act, or the MMA has presented a petition to the Court
under subparagraph (b) (1) of section 83, a conservator shall
be appointed by the MMA pursuant to section 70 on the
ground that the bank is not paying its financial obligations
as they fall due. The conservator shall forthwith take control
of the bank in accordance with section 73. The provisions
of section 74 shall not apply to a decision of the MMA
appointing a conservator pursuant to this section, and such
decision of the MMA shall not be subject to review by the
Court.
(a)

Upon filing of a petition for opening bankruptcy
proceedings against a bank, the Court shall summon
the MMA and any other petitioner, the conservator
appointed for the bank, and the bank to attend a public
hearing to consider the petition. In exceptional
situations the Court may decide to conduct a nonpublic hearing. The hearing shall begin within 2 (two)
business days from the time of filing of the petition.

(b)

If the petition is filed by the MMA, the hearing shall
be concluded within 1 (one) week. If the petition is
filed by creditors of the bank, the hearing shall be
concluded within 2 (two) weeks. At the conclusion of
the hearing, the Court shall either reject the petition or
grant the petition.

(a)

A petition for opening bankruptcy proceedings
against a bank shall be rejected by the Court if:

(b)

(1)

the petition does not meet the requirements of
this Act; or

(2)

the MMA opposes or rejects the petition under
paragraph (b) of this section.

If the petition is made by creditors of the bank, the
MMA may oppose the petition only if:
(1)

the MMA has determined that no statutory
ground for opening bankruptcy proceedings
against the bank applies; the Court may require
the MMA to produce evidence supporting its
determination, including financial statements
of the bank certified by the MMA;

(2)

the MMA demonstrates to the Court that,
before a copy of the application for opening
bankruptcy proceedings against the bank was
served upon the MMA, the banking licence of

64

the bank had been revoked and a receiver had
been appointed to liquidate the bank; or
(3)

(c)

the MMA submits to the Court a decision of
the Minister of Finance and Treasury in
accordance with section 78 of this Act that the
stability of the banking system of the Maldives
requires the recapitalization of the bank.

At its request, the MMA shall be granted 2 (two)
weeks in which to submit such evidence or decision,
before the Court rules on the petition.

(d) In addition to the occurrence of the events stated in
paragraph (a) of this section, the Court may reject a
petition for opening bankruptcy proceedings against a
bank only if:

Rejection of frivolous 87.
petitions filed by bank
creditors

(1)

any document or other evidence submitted to
the Court in support of the petition is
manifestly false or inaccurate and without such
document or other evidence the petition does
not meet the requirements of this Act; or

(2)

the bank shows to the satisfaction of both the
Court and the MMA that payments of
supplemental subscriptions to the capital of the
bank have been received by the bank in
immediately available funds sufficient to
eliminate the grounds for opening bankruptcy
proceedings against the bank under section 82
of this Act.

(a)

At any time after the filing of a petition for opening
bankruptcy proceedings against a bank by creditors of
the bank, the Court may reject the petition in writing,
with or without a hearing, on the grounds that the
petition is frivolous, in which case the petitioners may
be held liable for monetary damages, including costs
and expenses resulting from filing of the petition
which the Court may award.

(b)

In exceptional circumstances, the filing of a frivolous
petition for opening bankruptcy proceedings against a
bank may constitute an offense that, upon conviction
in the Criminal Court, may be punished by
imprisonment for a period between 6 (six) months and
3 (three) years or by the payment of a fine between
75,000/- (seventy five thousand) Rufiyaa and
150,000/- (one hundred and fifty thousand) Rufiyaa or
both.

(c)

Anyone who is determined by the Court to have filed
a frivolous petition for opening bankruptcy
proceedings against a bank may be subject to
prosecution in the Criminal Court in a proceeding

65

initiated by the Prosecutor General based on the
request of the Court.
Forced liquidation if 88.
bankruptcy petition is
rejected

If a petition presented by the MMA for opening bankruptcy
proceedings against a bank is rejected by the Court on
grounds other than those specified in section 86 of this Act,
or if the Court fails to observe the time periods set forth
under this Act or to render a decision in a timely manner
under section 85 of this Act, the MMA shall revoke the
banking licence of the bank and liquidate the bank in
accordance with the procedures prescribed by section 80 of
this Act.

Bankruptcy decision 89.

receiver

By the order of the Court to grant a petition for opening
bankruptcy proceedings against a bank, the bank shall be
declared bankrupt, and a receiver shall be appointed in
order to carry out the bankruptcy related activities.

Service

bankruptcy decision

Immediately after the Court has issued a decision granting
or rejecting a petition for opening bankruptcy proceedings
against a bank, the decision shall be served by the Court on
the MMA and on the bank and the Court shall arrange for
publication of the decision in the Government Gazette and
in a newspaper of general circulation.

Receiver

(a)

The receiver appointed by a decision of the Court
opening bankruptcy proceedings against a bank, or as
a replacement receiver, shall be selected by the Court
from a list of candidates submitted to the Court by the
MMA, unless a deposit insurance scheme with
mandatory participation has been established in the
Maldives, in which case the deposit insurer or its
designee shall be appointed by the Court as receiver.
Only fit and proper persons shall be eligible to serve
as receiver or as replacement receiver for a bank. A
person serving as conservator for the bank, if
otherwise qualified, shall be eligible to serve as
receiver. The bankruptcy decision shall specify the
remuneration and other terms and conditions of
employment of the receiver. The remuneration and
other costs incurred on account of the receiver shall
be paid from the assets of the bank for which the
receiver is appointed.

(b)

The MMA shall indemnify the receiver of a bank for
all liabilities and all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the receiver on account of the receivership
to the extent that they exceed the assets of the bank
available to meet such liabilities, costs or expenses.

(c)

Receivers shall carry out their activities under the
direction and supervision of the MMA, which, on the
appointment of the receiver, shall provide the receiver
with written directions including a list of activities
that the receiver may undertake without the direction
of the MMA. Such directions shall include a

91.

66

delegation of authority to the receiver to enter into
individual transactions not to exceed a stated amount
for each such transaction, including, but not limited
to, sales of assets, individually or by bulk sale.
Although the receiver may at any time apply to the
MMA for directions, the receiver shall be obligated to
apply to the MMA for directions only where
specifically required to do so by a provision of this
Act.

Powers of the receiver

92.

(d)

A receiver may employ at the expense of the bank for
which the receiver has been appointed such
specialists, on such terms and conditions, as the
MMA shall approve.

(e)

The Court shall replace the receiver immediately upon
the request of the MMA in any of the following
circumstances:
(1)

upon the resignation, death or incapacity to act
of the receiver; or

(2)

in the event that the receiver does not diligently
perform the receiver’s tasks; or

(3)

in the event that the receiver shall no longer be
a fit and proper person; or

(4)

if for any other reason, the receiver becomes
ineligible to serve in that capacity.

(f)

Whenever a receiver is replaced, the person replacing
the receiver shall succeed to the powers of the
receiver, and the books, records and assets of the bank
in the custody of the receiver as well as the books and
records of the receivership shall be transferred into
the custody of that person.

(1)

Upon appointment the receiver shall become the sole
legal representative of the bank, and succeeds to all
rights and powers of the shareholders of the bank, the
board of directors of the bank, and the authorized
manager of the bank including the power to operate
and to liquidate the bank. Such rights and powers
shall include holding title to the books, records, and
assets of the bank; operating the bank; marshalling
assets and claims; transferring or disposing of assets;
and taking any other action necessary for the effective
liquidation of the bank. The official duties of a
conservator, if any, shall terminate upon appointment
of a receiver.

(b)

Monetary claims against the bank shall be served on
the receiver for the bank.

67

Effect of bankruptcy 93.
decision

(a)

The decision of the Court opening bankruptcy
proceedings against a bank shall take effect at the
time that the decision is taken.

(b)

Immediately upon the bankruptcy decision taking
effect, the bank shall cease to take deposits from the
public.

(c)

Acts performed by or on behalf of the bank after the
bankruptcy decision takes effect are legally void and
unenforceable, except for acts performed by or under
authority of the receiver for the bank and acts deemed
beneficial to the bank by the receiver and ratified by
the receiver.

(d)

As a result of the bankruptcy decision, all current
court proceedings against the bank are stayed and no
court proceeding against the bank shall commence
after the bankruptcy decision takes effect, except with
the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the
Court imposes.

(e)

As a result of the bankruptcy decision, all restraints
on the disposition of bank assets and attachments in
aid of execution on the bank’s assets in favour of
creditors shall be deemed removed by operation of
law. Attachments placed and acts of execution
performed after the bankruptcy decision takes effect
shall be void, except for execution in accordance with
section 102 of this Act of assets encumbered by a
mortgage or lien to the extent of the debt secured by
such encumbrance.

(f)

Neither interest nor any other charge shall accrue on
liabilities of a bankrupt bank after the bankruptcy
decision takes effect.

(g)

Transfers of shares made after the bankruptcy
decision takes effect, except for transfers made with
the prior consent of the MMA, shall be void.

(h)

All legal acts of the bank that are done within
90 (ninety) days before the time of the decision
whereby bankruptcy proceedings are opened against
the bank shall upon application of the receiver be
declared null and void by the MMA if the bank and its
counterparty in the act knew or should have known at
the time of the act that the act would damage the
interests of creditors of the bank. Such knowledge
shall be presumed whenever the act consists of:
(1)

a gift or other transfer without consideration to
any person;

68

Finality in payment 94.
and
securities
settlement systems

(a)

(2)

a payment or transfer to an owner,
administrator or employee of the bank, unless
such owner, administrator or employee shows
to the satisfaction of the Court that the payment
or transfer concerned his employment by the
bank or concerned an account maintained with
the bank, and was not unusual in size, or that
he did not know that the payment or transfer
would damage interests of creditors of the
bank;

(3)

a payment or transfer before its due date or the
transfer of collateral for a debt before the due
date of the debt;

(4)

the conclusion of a contract imposing
obligations on the bank that is significantly
more onerous than the obligations imposed on
the other party or parties to the contract;

(5)

an arrangement between the bank and one or
more other persons, other than an eligible
financial contract defined in section 99 of this
Act, permitting an offset between rights and
obligations of the bank that without such
arrangement would not have been permissible
before the time of the bankruptcy decision;

(6)

interbank transfers between a domestic branch
of a foreign bank and such foreign bank or its
branches or subsidiaries abroad.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of
section 72 of this Act, subparagraph (b) (1) of section
80, paragraph (g) and subparagraphs (h) (2) and (3) of
section 93, stating that certain transactions shall be
void, the validity of transactions made through
payment and securities settlement systems shall be
determined in the following manner:
(1)

irrevocable money and securities transfer
orders entered by a bank into a payment or
securities settlement system recognized as such
by the MMA shall be legally enforceable and
binding on third parties, even in the event of a
decision of the Court opening bankruptcy
proceedings against the bank, but only if the
transfer orders become irrevocable before the
bankruptcy decision takes effect; or

(2)

where a bank enters irrevocable money or
securities transfer orders into a payment or
securities settlement system after a court
decision opening bankruptcy proceedings
against the bank takes effect and the transfer
orders are carried out on the day of the decision

69

of the Court, the transfer orders shall be legally
enforceable and binding on third parties, unless
the receiver proves that the system operator
was aware of the bankruptcy decision before
the transfer orders became irrevocable.

Transfers of bank 95.
shares, assets and
liabilities

(b)

No law, regulation, rule or practice on the setting
aside of contracts and transactions concluded before
the decision of the Court opening bankruptcy
proceedings against a bank takes effect shall lead to
the unwinding of a netting by a payment or securities
settlement system recognized as such by the MMA
because of that decision.

(c)

For the purpose of this section a transfer order entered
into a money or securities settlement system becomes
irrevocable at the time defined by the rules of that
system.

(a)

In the interests of preserving the soundness of the
banking system and to maximize the value of a bank
for its creditors, in the event that the receiver, with the
concurrence of the MMA, determines that engaging in
a transaction or series of transactions set forth in
subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph is
necessary, the receiver shall then provide notice of the
intended action to the Court for its approval:
(1)

transfer all or substantially all of the shares in
capital stock of the bank; or

(2)

transfer all or substantially all of the assets, of
the assets of the bank, or all or substantially all
of the liabilities of the bank, or both.

The approval of the Court shall not be necessary for
transactions other than those referred to in
subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph.
(b)

If the Court does not disapprove the transaction
proposed within 15 days of its receipt of the notice
described in paragraph (a) of this section, then the
receiver may proceed to implement the proposal
without further delay.

(c)

A transaction pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section
may be proposed at any time after the filing of a
petition for opening bankruptcy proceedings against
the bank until the bank has been liquidated.

(d)

A transaction pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section
shall not require the consent of the bank or any of its
governing bodies. In reviewing a notice by a receiver
of intent to cause a transfer of part of the obligations
of the bank whereby some creditors would be
excluded from the transfer, the Court shall take the

70

interests of such creditors into account. A transfer of
liabilities shall become effective at the beginning of
the day following the day of publication of a notice of
the transfer in the Government Gazette.
Property report of the 96.
bank

Registration of claims

97.

(1)

Within 30 (thirty) days or within any extended period
given by MMA, from the date of the appointment of
the receiver, the receiver shall prepare and submit to
the MMA a property report of the bank. Such
property report shall include the following:
(1)

the assets of the bank, including claims of the
bank on account of unpaid subscriptions of
capital stock of the bank, loan and guarantee
agreements, and agreements of purchase or
sale, as well as the book values and estimated
liquidation values of the assets;

(2)

the contracts pursuant to which property of the
bank is held by other parties, including rental,
lease and collateral agreements;

(3)

the contracts pursuant to which the bank
receives services; and

(4)

the significant transactions entered into by the
bank during the period of 30 (thirty) days
immediately preceding the date of the
bankruptcy decision.

(b)

The report shall be updated quarterly and shall be
made available at the MMA for inspection by the
creditors of the bank whose claims are included on the
list of approved claims stated in section 98 of this Act.

(a)

Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
section 98, claims on a bankrupt bank shall be
registered with the receiver in writing within
60 (sixty) days from the date that the decision of the
Court opening bankruptcy proceedings against the
bank is published in the Government Gazette. At the
request of 3 (three) or more creditors submitted to the
Court at least 10 (ten) days before the expiration of
the period referred to in this paragraph, the Court may
once extend this term for all creditors by 30 (thirty)
days on grounds of equity.

(b)

Claims shall be registered together with documentary
evidence of the claim and the following information:
(1)

the name and address of the creditor;

(2)

the amounts of interest and other charges,
penalties and taxes included in the principal
amount of the claim; and

71

(3)

Admission of claims

98.

details concerning any mortgage, lien or
guarantee securing the claim, including the
name and address of any guarantor.

(c)

The decision of the Court opening bankruptcy
proceedings against a bank suspends the authority of
depositors to access their deposits recorded in the
books or records of the bank. However, the receiver,
acting pursuant to section 108 of this Act, and in order
to mitigate hardship to depositors, may authorize
depositors to access a limited amount of their funds as
may be necessary to meet living expenses.

(d)

Creditors shall be given a registration receipt by the
receiver on the registering of a claim, which shall be
conclusive evidence of registration.

(a)

Only claims that are registered in accordance with
section 97 of this Act may be admitted. However,
claims on account of deposits recorded in the books or
records of the bank shall be admitted for the amounts
so recorded without requiring registration.

(b)

Registered claims recorded in the books or records of
the bank shall be admitted by the receiver as recorded
without further proof. However, claims registered for
an amount that is less than the amount recorded by the
bank shall be admitted only for the lesser amount
claimed.

(c)

Claims secured by a mortgage or lien resting on assets
of the bank may be registered by creditors of the bank
for the amount by which the amount of the claim
exceeds the expected sales value of the asset in a
public auction. Any claim so registered shall not be
admitted until the auction has taken place or title to
the asset has been otherwise transferred pursuant to
section 102 of this Act.

(d)

Claims whose value is uncertain may be admitted for
a value estimated by the receiver.

(e)

After examining the registered claims, the receiver
shall record the claims admitted by the receiver on a
list of admitted claims and the receiver shall record
the claims contested by the receiver on a list of
contested claims specifying the reasons for the
opposition. Registered claims contested in part shall
be recorded on both lists for the admitted part and the
contested part respectively. Both lists shall for each
claimant specify name and address, the amounts of
the claims, and whether the claims are secured by
collateral. Claims shall be listed together, in the order
of their priority of payment.

72

Set off and netting

99.

(f)

Both lists specified in the paragraph (e) of this section
shall be completed and submitted to the Court for
approval within 30 (thirty) days after the deadline for
registration of claims. Thereafter, the receiver shall
submit quarterly updated lists to the Court for
approval. Before approving the lists, the Court may
move claims from one list to the other in consultation
with the receiver. The Court may specify the evidence
required for the approval of contested claims.

(g)

The Court shall set dates for hearings where creditors
whose claims are contested may submit evidence to
prove their claims to the receiver and the Court,
provided that such hearings shall be held not later
than 60 (sixty) days after the date on which the list of
contested claims is submitted to the Court. Creditors
shall be notified of the date of each hearing by a
written notice sent to the creditor’s address and by
notice placed by the receiver in the Government
Gazette. No creditor need be notified of a hearing in
writing more than once for the same claim. Following
the hearing, the Court shall decide whether the
contested claims shall be approved or rejected. Claims
for which the creditor fails to appear at the hearing of
which the creditor has notified in writing shall be
regarded as rejected by the Court. Creditors whose
claims have been rejected by the Court shall be
notified by the receiver in writing.

(h)

The approval by the Court of claims shall be final.
Claims approved by the Court shall be removed from
the list of claims admitted by the receiver or the list of
claims contested by the receiver, and be recorded on a
list of approved claims, a copy of which shall be kept
by the Court and the receiver. Creditors whose claims
have been approved by the Court shall be notified by
the receiver in writing.

(i)

No payment shall be made by the receiver on account
of claims that are rejected by the Court. The creditor
whose claim has been rejected by the Court may
appeal the decision of the Court to the High Court
within 2 (two) weeks after the date of receipt of notice
of the decision.

(a)

Except as otherwise stated in this section, no
provision of this Act and no decision made under this
Act shall prevent or prohibit the set off by operation
of law of obligations between a bankrupt bank and its
contractual counterparties. However, the receiver may
prohibit the following:
(1)

the set off of deposits against loan balances
where the effect, as determined by the receiver,
would be to unfairly prefer some depositors

73

over others, and
(2)
(b)

the set off of deposits by directors, officers and
employees of the bank.

In determining the financial obligations and rights
between a bankrupt bank and its contractual
counterparties, effect shall be given to the termination
and set off provisions of eligible financial contracts
between them. The net termination value determined
in accordance with an eligible financial contract
between them shall be a claim of the bank on the
counterparty or shall be admitted after its registration
as a claim of the counterparty on the bank. In this
paragraph, “eligible financial contract” means any of
the following agreements:
(1)

a currency or interest rate swap agreement;

(2)

a basis swap agreement;

(3)

a spot, future, forward or other foreign
exchange agreement;

(4)

an agreement providing for a cap, collar or
floor transaction;

(5)

a commodity swap agreement;

(6)

a forward rate agreement;

(7)

with respect to assets other than those set forth in
subparagraph (c) (1) of this section, the receiver may
satisfy the claim of any secured creditor by payment
to such creditor without need for a public auction. In
