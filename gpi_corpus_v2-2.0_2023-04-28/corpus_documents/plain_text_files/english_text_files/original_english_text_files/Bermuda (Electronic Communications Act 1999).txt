PART II
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS RESPECTING ELECTRONIC RECORDS
Legal recognition of electronic records
8
Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity, admissibility or enforceability
solely on the ground that it is—
(a) in the form of an electronic record; or
(b) not contained in the electronic record purporting to give rise to such legal
effect, but is referred to in that electronic record.
Writing
9
(1) Where information is required by law to be in writing or is described in any
statutory provision as being written, that requirement or description is met by an electronic
record if the information contained in the electronic record is accessible and is capable of
retention for subsequent reference.
(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement for the information to be in
writing is in the form of an obligation or the law provides consequences if it is not in writing.
Delivery
10
(1) Where information is required by law to be delivered, dispatched, given or sent
to, or to be served on, a person, that requirement is met by doing so in the form of an
electronic record provided that the originator of the electronic record states that the receipt
of the electronic record is to be acknowledged and the addressee has acknowledged its
receipt.

6

ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT 1999
(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement for delivery, dispatch, giving,
sending or serving is in the form of an obligation or the law provides consequences for the
information not being delivered, dispatched, given, sent or served.
Signature
11
(1) Where the signature of a person is required by law, that requirement is met by
an electronic record if—
(a) a method is used to identify that person and to indicate that the person
intended to sign or otherwise adopt the information in the electronic
record; and
(b) that method is as reliable as is appropriate for the purpose for which the
electronic record was generated or communicated, in the light of all the
circumstances, including any relevant agreement.
(2) An electronic record that meets the requirements of subsection (1)(a) and (b)
shall not be denied legal effect, validity and enforceability solely on the ground that it—
(a) is not an electronic signature; or
(b) is not associated with an accredited certificate.
(3) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement for a signature is in the form
of an obligation or the law provides consequences for the absence of a signature.
Original form
12
(1) Where information is required by law to be presented or retained in its original
form, that requirement is met by an electronic record if—
(a) there exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of the information from
the time it was first generated in its final form as an electronic record or
otherwise; and
(b) where it is required that information be presented, that information is
capable of being accurately represented to the person to whom it is to be
presented.
(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement for the information to be
presented or retained in its original form is in the form of an obligation or the law provides
consequences if it is not presented or retained in its original form.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a)—
(a) the criterion for assessing integrity is whether the information has
remained complete and unaltered, apart from the addition of any
endorsement and any change which arises in the normal course of
communication, storage and display; and
(b) the standard of reliability required is to be assessed in the light of the
purpose for which the information was generated and all the relevant
circumstances.

7

ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT 1999

13
(1) Where certain documents, records or information are required by law to be
retained, that requirement is met by retaining electronic records if the following conditions
are satisfied—
(a) the information contained in the electronic record is accessible and is
capable of retention for subsequent reference;
(b) the electronic record is retained in the format in which it was generated,
sent or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to represent

(c) any information that enables the identification of the origin and destination
of an electronic record and the date and time when it was sent or received
is retained.
(2) An obligation to retain documents, records or information in accordance with
subsection (1) does not extend to any information the sole purpose of which is to enable the
message to be sent or received.

services of any other person, if the conditions set out in subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c) are
met.

14
(1) In any legal proceedings, nothing in the rules of evidence shall apply so as to
deny the admissibility of an electronic record in evidence—
(a) solely on the ground that it is an electronic record; or
(b) if it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be
expected to obtain, on the ground that it is not in its original form.
(2) Information in the form of an electronic record will be given due evidential
weight and in assessing the evidential weight of an electronic record, regard shall be had
to—
(a) the reliability of the manner in which the electronic record was generated,
stored or communicated;
(b) the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was
maintained;
(c) the manner in which the originator was identified; and

ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT 1999
PART III
COMMUNICATION OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS
Formation and validity of contracts
15
(1) In the context of formation of contracts, unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of electronic records.
(2) As between the originator and the addressee of an electronic record, a
declaration of intention or other statement or delivery of a deed shall not be denied legal
effect, validity or enforceability solely on the ground that it is in the form of an electronic
record.
Attribution of electronic records
16
(1) An electronic record is attributable to a person if the electronic record resulted
from the action of the person, acting in person, by his agent, or by his electronic agent
device.
(2) Attribution may be proven in any manner, including by showing the efficacy of
any security procedure applied to determine the person to whom the electronic record was
attributable.
(3) Attribution of an electronic record by a person under this section has the effect
provided for by the law, regulation, or agreement regarding the security procedure.
Acknowledgement of receipt of electronic records
17
(1) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) apply where, on or before sending an electronic
record, or by means of that electronic record, the originator has requested or has agreed
with the addressee that receipt of the electronic record be acknowledged.
(2) Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the
acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an
acknowledgement may be given by—
(a) any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or
(b) any conduct of the addressee,
that is reasonably sufficient to indicate to the originator that the electronic record has been
received.
(3) Where the originator has stated that the electronic record is conditional on
receipt of the acknowledgement, the electronic record is to be treated as though it had never
been sent until the acknowledgement is received.
(4) Where the originator has not stated that the electronic record is conditional on
receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the
originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed,
within a reasonable time, the originator—

9

ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT 1999
(a) may give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has
been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the
acknowledgement must be received; and
(b) if the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in
paragraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the electronic
record as though it had never been sent or exercise any other rights the
originator may have.
(5) Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt, it is
presumed that the related electronic record was received by the addressee, but that
presumption does not imply that the electronic record corresponds to the record received.
(6) Where the received acknowledgement states that the related electronic record
met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is
presumed that those requirements have been met.
(7) Except in so far as it relates to the sending or receipt of the electronic record,
this section is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from
that electronic record or from the acknowledgement of its receipt.
Time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic records
18
(1) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the
dispatch of an electronic record occurs when it enters an information processing system
outside the control of the originator.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of
receipt of an electronic record is determined as follows—
(a) where the addressee has designated an information processing system for
the purpose of receiving electronic records, receipt occurs—
(i) at the time when the electronic record enters the designated
information processing system; or
(ii) if the electronic record is sent to an information processing system of
the addressee that is not the designated information processing system,
at the time when the electronic record comes to the attention of the
addressee;
(b) where the addressee has not designated an information processing system,
receipt occurs when the electronic record enters an information processing
system of the addressee or otherwise comes to the attention of the
addressee.
(3) Subsection (2) applies notwithstanding that the place where the information
processing system is located may be different from the place where the electronic record is
deemed to be received under subsection (4).
(4) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, an
electronic record is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has his place

10

ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT 1999
of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has his place of
business.
(5) For the purposes of subsection (4)—
(a) if the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the
place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the
transaction to which the electronic record relates or, where there is no such
transaction, the place of business is presumed to be the principal place of
business; or
(b) if the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, it is
presumed to be where the originator or the addressee ordinarily resides.
PART IV
ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES
Electronic signature associated with an accredited certificate
An electronic signature that is associated with an accredited certificate issued by
19

to provide accredited certificates.
(3) Subject to subsection (4), the Minister, if satisfied that an authorised
certification service provider no longer meets the relevant criteria, may by notice published
in the Gazette revoke an authorisation given under subsection (2).
(4) Before revoking an authorisation under subsection (3), the Minister shall give
notice in writing to the authorised certification service provider of his intention to do so and
indicating his reasons for the proposed revocation and shall invite the authorised
certification service provider, within 14 days of the notice, to submit representations in
writing as to why the authorisation should not be revoked, and the Minister shall consider
those representations.
(5) In this section the “relevant criteria” means such policy criteria as the Minister
may specify by notice published in the Gazette.

classes of certificates issued in, or certification service providers or classes of certification
service providers established in any other jurisdiction and, upon such recognition and on
payment of such fee as may be prescribed under the Government Fees Act 1965—
(a) those certificates or classes of certificates shall be deemed to be accredited
certificates; and
(b) those certification service providers or classes of certification service
providers shall be deemed to be authorised under subsection 20(2).
(2) In determining to accord recognition under subsection (1) the Minister shall
have regard to whether—
(a) the certificates or classes of certificates are required to, and do in fact, meet
obligations equivalent to those required for an accredited certificate; and

providers are required to, and do in fact, meet criteria equivalent to those
required for an authorised certification service provider.
(3) The Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, revoke any recognition
accorded under subsection (1), but, before doing so, the Minister shall advise the person
affected of his intention to do so and indicating his reasons for the proposed revocation and
shall invite that person, within 14 days of the notice, to submit representations in writing
as to why the recognition should not be revoked, and the Minister shall consider those
representations.
Pseudonyms
22
(1) Certification service providers may, at the request of a particular signatory,
indicate in the relevant certificate a pseudonym instead of the signatory’s name.
(2) Where a pseudonym is indicated pursuant to subsection (1), the certification
service provider shall, where necessary for the investigation of an offence involving the use
of electronic signatures or where otherwise required by law to do so, transfer personal data
relating to the signatory.
(3) Where personal data is transferred pursuant to subsection (2), the certification
service provider shall make a record of the transfer and as soon as possible thereafter give
notice to the signatory of the transfer.
Liability of authorised certification service provider
23
(1) By issuing an accredited certificate, an authorised certification service provider
is liable to any person who reasonably relied on the certificate for—
(a) the accuracy of all information in the accredited certificate as from the date

12

ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT 1999
(b) assurance that the person identified in the accredited certificate held, at
the time the accredited certificate was issued, the signature creation device
corresponding to the signature verification device given or identified in the
accredited certificate;
(c) if the authorised certification service provider generates both the signature
creation device and the signature verification device, assurance that the
two devices function together in a complementary manner,
unless the person who relied on the accredited certificate knows or ought reasonably to
have known that the authorisation of the certification service provider has been revoked.

information in an accredited certificate where—
(a) the information was provided by or on behalf of the person identified in the
accredited certificate; and

is not liable for damages arising from the use of the accredited certificate contrary to those
limits.
(4) The limits in subsection (3) may include a limit on the value of transactions for
which the accredited certificate is valid.

made on oath, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is in
possession of information or of a computer, computer program on any similar
device which is relevant to the interpretation of any thing seized under subsection
(1), then the magistrate or Justice of the Peace may direct that person to assist a
police officer in the manner provided in subsection (7).”.
(c) by the addition of the following:
“(6) If the thing seized under a warrant issued under subsection (1) is a
computer, computer program, or any other similar device, the magistrate may

any person arrested in connection with the warrant pursuant to which the
computer, computer program or other similar device was seized to disclose or
execute any procedure necessary to render the contents of the computer intelligible.
(7) If any other person is in possession of the devices, procedures or
information necessary to render intelligible the contents of a computer, computer

magistrate may by direction pursuant to subsection (1A), require such person to
surrender or provide copies of such devices or information or to execute such
procedures.
(8) Any person who fails to comply with a direction under subsection (1A),
(6) or (7) is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment
for 6 months or to a fine of $50,000, or to both.”.
