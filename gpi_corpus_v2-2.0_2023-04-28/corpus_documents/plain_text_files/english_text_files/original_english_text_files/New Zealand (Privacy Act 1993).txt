any international organisation; or

(c)

to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial; or

Trade secrets

(1)

Subject to subsection (2), an agency may refuse to disclose any information
requested pursuant to principle 6 if the withholding of the information is necessary to protect information where the making available of the information—

(2)

(a)

would disclose a trade secret; or

(b)

would be likely unreasonably to prejudice the commercial position of the
person who supplied or who is the subject of the information.

Information may not be withheld under subsection (1) if, in the circumstances
of the particular case, the withholding of that information is outweighed by
other considerations which render it desirable, in the public interest, to make
the information available.

Other reasons for refusal of requests

(1)

An agency may refuse to disclose any information requested pursuant to principle 6 if—
(a)

the disclosure of the information would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another individual or of a deceased individual; or

(b)

the disclosure of the information or of information identifying the person
who supplied it, being evaluative material, would breach an express or
implied promise—

(c)

(i)

which was made to the person who supplied the information; and

(ii)

which was to the effect that the information or the identity of the
person who supplied it or both would be held in confidence; or

after consultation undertaken (where practicable) by or on behalf of the
agency with an individual’s medical practitioner, the agency is satisfied
that—
(i)

the information relates to that individual; and

(ii)

the disclosure of the information (being information that relates to
the physical or mental health of the individual who requested it)
would be likely to prejudice the physical or mental health of that
individual; or

(d)

in the case of an individual under the age of 16, the disclosure of that
information would be contrary to that individual’s interests; or

(e)

the disclosure of that information (being information in respect of an
individual who has been convicted of an offence or is or has been
detained in custody) would be likely to prejudice the safe custody or the
rehabilitation of that individual; or

(f)

the disclosure of the information would breach legal professional privilege; or
35

Part 4 s 29

(g)

(3)

in the case of a request made to Radio New Zealand Limited or Television New Zealand Limited, the disclosure of the information would be
likely to reveal the source of information of a bona fide news media
journalist and either—
(i)

the information is subject to an obligation of confidence; or

(ii)

the disclosure of the information would be likely to prejudice the
supply of similar information, or information from the same
source; or

the disclosure of the information, being information contained in material placed in any library or museum or archive, would breach a condition
subject to which that material was so placed; or

(i)

the disclosure of the information would constitute contempt of court or
of the House of Representatives; or

(ia)

the request is made by a defendant or a defendant’s agent and is—
(i)

for information that could be sought by the defendant under the
Criminal Disclosure Act 2008; or

(ii)

for information that could be sought by the defendant under that
Act and that has been disclosed to, or withheld from, the defendant under that Act; or

the request is frivolous or vexatious, or the information requested is trivial.

An agency may refuse a request made pursuant to principle 6 if—
(a)

the information requested is not readily retrievable; or

(b)

the information requested does not exist or cannot be found; or

(c)

the information requested is not held by the agency and the person dealing with the request has no grounds for believing that the information is
either—
(i)

held by another agency; or

(ii)

connected more closely with the functions or activities of another
agency.

Interference with privacy

(1)

For the purposes of this Part, an action is an interference with the privacy of an
individual if, and only if,—
(a)

in relation to that individual,—
(i)

the action breaches an information privacy principle; or

(ii)

the action breaches a code of practice issued under section 63
(which relates to public registers); or

(iia) the action breaches an information privacy principle or a code of
practice as modified by an Order in Council made under section
96J; or
(iib) the provisions of an information sharing agreement approved by
an Order in Council made under section 96J have not been complied with; or
(iii)
(b)

(2)

in the opinion of the Commissioner or, as the case may be, the Tribunal,
the action—
(i)

has caused, or may cause, loss, detriment, damage, or injury to
that individual; or

(ii)

has adversely affected, or may adversely affect, the rights, benefits, privileges, obligations, or interests of that individual; or

(iii)

has resulted in, or may result in, significant humiliation, significant loss of dignity, or significant injury to the feelings of that
individual.

Without limiting subsection (1), an action is an interference with the privacy of
an individual if, in relation to an information privacy request made by the individual,—
(a)

54

the provisions of Part 10 (which relates to information matching)
have not been complied with; and

the action consists of a decision made under Part 4 or Part 5 in relation
to the request, including—
(i)

a refusal to make information available in response to the request;
or

(ii)

a decision by which an agency decides, in accordance with section
42 or section 43, in what manner or, in accordance with section
40, for what charge the request is to be granted; or

(b)

Privacy Act 1993

Part 8 s 68

(iii)

a decision by which an agency imposes conditions on the use,
communication, or publication of information made available pursuant to the request; or

(iv)

a decision by which an agency gives a notice under section 32; or

(v)

a decision by which an agency extends any time limit under section 41; or

(vi)

a refusal to correct personal information; and

the Commissioner or, as the case may be, the Tribunal is of the opinion
that there is no proper basis for that decision.

(3)

If, in relation to any information privacy request, any agency fails within the
time limit fixed by section 40(1) (or, where that time limit has been extended
under this Act, within that time limit as so extended) to comply with paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of section 40(1), that failure shall be deemed, for the
purposes of subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section, to be a refusal to make available
the information to which the request relates.

(4)

Undue delay in making information available in response to an information privacy request for that information shall be deemed, for the purposes of subsection (2)(a)(i), to be a refusal to make that information available.

Compliance with requirements of Commissioner

(1)

This section applies in every case where, during the course of an investigation
under Part 8 of any decision of any agency in relation to an information privacy
request, the Commissioner, pursuant to any power conferred on the Commissioner by section 91, requires that agency to furnish or produce to the Commissioner any information or document or thing which relates to that investigation.

(2)

In any case to which this section applies, the agency to which the requirement
is made shall, subject to section 93, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in
no case later than 20 working days after the day on which the requirement is
received by the agency, comply with the requirement.

(3)

If any agency (being a department or a Minister or an organisation) fails,
within the time limit fixed by subsection (2) (or, where that time limit has been
extended under section 93, within that time limit as so extended), to comply
with any requirement to which subsection (1) applies, the Commissioner may
report such failure to the Prime Minister.
Compare: 1982 No 156 s 29A(1), (6); 1987 No 8 s 17(3); 1987 No 174 s 29(1); 1991 No 126 s 25(1),
(6)

93

Extension of time limit

(1)

Where any requirement to which section 92 applies is made to any agency, the
agency may extend the time limit set out in subsection (2) of that section in
respect of that requirement if—
(a)

70

the requirement relates to, or necessitates a search through, a large quantity of information or a large number of documents or things, and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the agency; or

Reprinted as at

Privacy Act 1993

Part 9 s 94

(b)

consultations necessary before the requirement can be complied with are
such that the requirement cannot reasonably be complied with within the
original time limit; or

(c)

the complexity of the issues raised by the requirement are such that the
requirement cannot reasonably be complied with within the original time
limit.

(2)

Any extension under subsection (1) shall be for a reasonable period of time
having regard to the circumstances.

(3)

The extension shall be effected by giving or posting notice of the extension to
the Commissioner within 20 working days after the day on which the requirement is received.

(4)

The notice effecting the extension shall—
(a)

specify the period of the extension; and

(b)

give the reasons for the extension; and

(1)

Except as provided in section 119, every person shall have the same privileges
in relation to the giving of information to, the answering of questions put by,
and the production of documents and things to, the Commissioner or any
employee of the Commissioner as witnesses have in any court.

(1A) Nothing in subsection (1) prevents the Commissioner or any employee of the
Commissioner from—
(a)

requiring, under section 91, the furnishing of any information or the production of any document or thing which is the subject of a complaint
under Part 8 and in respect of which privilege is claimed by any person;
and

(b)

considering the information or inspecting any such document or thing—

for the purpose of determining whether the information, document, or thing
would be properly withheld, but not so as to give the Commissioner or
employee any information, or enable the Commissioner or employee to make
any use of the information, document, or thing, that he or she would not, apart
from this subsection, be entitled to.
(1B) On the production of any information, document, or thing pursuant to subsection (1A), the Commissioner or any employee of the Commissioner—
(a)

must not, without the consent of the producer of the information, document, or thing, and of any person who is the subject of the information,
document, or thing, release the information, document, or thing, or any

71

Part 9 s 95

Privacy Act 1993

Reprinted as at

information derived from the document or thing, to any person other
than—

(b)

(i)

the producer of the information, document, or thing; or

(ii)

any barrister or solicitor engaged by the Commissioner for the
purpose of providing legal advice as to whether the information,
document, or thing would be properly withheld by that producer
under subsection (1); or

(iii)

where the Commissioner gives his or her opinion on the claim of
privilege to the Director of Human Rights Proceedings under
paragraph (b), to the Director of Human Rights Proceedings:

may give his or her opinion only to the parties to the complaint or to the
Director of Human Rights Proceedings or to the Human Rights Review
Tribunal as to whether or not the claim of privilege is valid:
provided that nothing in this paragraph prevents the Commissioner or
any employee of the Commissioner from releasing, either generally or to
any particular person, the opinion in a form that does not identify either
the producer of the information, document, or thing or any person who is
the subject of the information, document, or thing:

(c)

(2)

must not take into account the information or any information in the
document or thing in forming any opinion concerning the release of any
other information.

No person shall be liable to prosecution for an offence against any enactment,
other than section 127, by reason of that person’s compliance with any requirement of the Commissioner or any employee of the Commissioner under section
91.

Disclosures of information, etc

(1)

Subject to subsection (2) and to section 94, any person who is bound by the
provisions of any enactment to maintain secrecy in relation to, or not to disclose, any matter may be required to supply any information to, or answer any
question put by, the Commissioner in relation to that matter, or to produce to
the Commissioner any document or thing relating to it, notwithstanding that

72

Reprinted as at

Privacy Act 1993

Part 9 s 96

compliance with that requirement would otherwise be in breach of the obligation of secrecy or non-disclosure.
(2)

Compliance with a requirement of the Commissioner (being a requirement
made pursuant to subsection (1)) is not a breach of the relevant obligation of
secrecy or non-disclosure or of the enactment by which that obligation is
imposed.

(3)

Where—
(a)

(b)

the Prime Minister certifies that the giving of any information, or the
production of any document or thing, might prejudice—
(i)

the security or defence of New Zealand, or the international relations of the Government of New Zealand; or

(ii)

any interest protected by section 7 of the Official Information Act
1982 (which relates to the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the
Ross Dependency); or

the Attorney-General certifies that the giving of any information, or the
production of any document or thing,—
(i)

might prejudice the prevention, investigation, or detection of
offences; or

(ii)

might involve the disclosure of proceedings of Cabinet, or any
committee of Cabinet, relating to matters of a secret or confidential nature, and such disclosure would be injurious to the public
interest,—

neither the Commissioner nor any employee of the Commissioner shall require
the information to be given or, as the case may be, the document or thing to be
produced.

(a)

provides a mechanism for the approval of information sharing agreements for the sharing of information between or within agencies; and

(b)

authorises exemptions from or modifications to—
(i)

96B Relationship between Part 9A and other law relating to information
disclosure
(1)

(2)

(3)

To avoid doubt, nothing in this Part—
(a)

limits the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information that is
authorised or required by or under any enactment; and

(b)

compels agencies to enter into an information sharing agreement if those
agencies are already allowed to share personal information—
(i)

by or under any other enactment:

(ii)

in circumstances where an exemption from or a modification to
any 1 or more of the information privacy principles or any code of
practice is not required to make the sharing of the information
lawful.

Without limiting subsection (1)(a),—
(a)

this Part does not limit section 7, 54 or 57; and

(b)

this Part does not limit Part 10, 10A, or 11.

An information sharing agreement may—
(a)

(b)

duplicate an information sharing provision by providing for an agency to
share the same personal information as specified in the information sharing provision—
(i)

with the same agencies specified in the information sharing provision; and

(ii)

for the same purposes specified in the information sharing provision; or

extend an information sharing provision that is not a restricted information sharing provision by providing for an agency to share the same personal information as specified in the information sharing provision—
(i)

with the same agencies specified in the information sharing provision for a purpose not specified in the information sharing provision; or

(ii)

Information matching guidelines
98

Information matching guidelines
The following matters are the matters referred to in section 13(1)(f) to which
the Commissioner shall have particular regard, in examining any proposed
legislation that makes provision for the collection of personal information by
any public sector agency, or the disclosure of personal information by one public sector agency to any other public sector agency, in any case where the Commissioner considers that the information might be used for the purposes of an
information matching programme:

94

(a)

whether or not the objective of the programme relates to a matter of significant public importance:

(b)

whether or not the use of the programme to achieve that objective will
result in monetary savings that are both significant and quantifiable, or
in other comparable benefits to society:

(c)

whether or not the use of an alternative means of achieving that objective would give either of the results referred to in paragraph (b):

(d)

whether or not the public interest in allowing the programme to proceed
outweighs the public interest in adhering to the information privacy principles that the programme would otherwise contravene:

(e)

whether or not the programme involves information matching on a scale
that is excessive, having regard to—
(i)

the number of agencies that will be involved in the programme;
and

(ii)

the amount of detail about an individual that will be matched
under the programme:

matching programme may charge each other fees for the services provided for
the purposes of the programme.

lawfully be made, by any specified agency, of any information produced by an
authorised information matching programme.

95

Part 10 s 102

Privacy Act 1993

Reprinted as at

information and made a decision to take adverse action against any individual
on the basis of that discrepancy.
(2)

Any adverse action commenced by a specified agency in accordance with subsection (1) shall be commenced not later than 12 months from the date on
which the information was derived or received by the agency.

(3)

matching programme, the agency shall as soon as practicable destroy the information.

(4)

When information produced by an authorised information matching programme is no longer needed by a specified agency for the purposes of taking

Extension of time limit
Where a specified agency derives or receives information produced by an
authorised information matching programme, the Commissioner may, either
generally or in respect of any case or class of cases, extend the time limit set
out in section 101 in respect of that information if the Commissioner is satisfied that,—
(a)

paid to an individual where the discrepancy arises in respect of departure information supplied to that department pursuant to section 308 of the Customs and

(a)

specifying particulars of the discrepancy and the suspension of benefit,

offence or the possible commission of an offence.

(2A) Nothing in subsection (1) prevents any constable or any bailiff from immediately executing a warrant to arrest an individual in respect of the non-payment
of the whole or any part of a fine if the discrepancy arises in respect of arrival

Schedule 4
Information matching rules
ss 97, 99, 107

1

Notice to individuals affected

(1)

Agencies involved in an authorised information matching programme shall
take all reasonable steps (which may consist of or include public notification)
to ensure that the individuals who will be affected by the programme are notified of the programme.

(2)

Nothing in subclause (1) requires an agency to notify any individual about an
authorised information matching programme if to do so would be likely to frustrate the objective of the programme.

2

Use of unique identifiers
Except as provided in any other enactment, unique identifiers shall not be used
as part of any authorised information matching programme unless their use is
essential to the success of the programme.

3

On-line transfers

(1)

Except with the approval of the Commissioner, information transferred
between agencies for the purposes of an authorised information matching programme shall not be transferred by means of on-line computer connections.

(2)

Any approval given under subclause (1) may be given either unconditionally or
subject to such conditions as the Commissioner thinks fit.

(3)

Any approval given under subclause (1) may at any time be withdrawn by the
Commissioner; and any condition subject to which any such approval is given
may from time to time be revoked, varied, or added to by the Commissioner.

4

Technical standards

(1)

The agency primarily responsible for the operation of an authorised information matching programme shall establish and maintain detailed technical standards to govern the operation of the programme.

(2)

The technical standards established by an agency in accordance with subclause
(1) shall deal with the following matters:
(a)

(b)

the integrity of the information to be matched, with particular reference
to—
(i)

key terms and their definition; and

(ii)

relevance, timeliness, and completeness:

the matching techniques to be used in the programme, with particular
reference to—
(i)

the matching algorithm:
143

Schedule 4

Privacy Act 1993

Reprinted as at
1 December 2020

(ii)

any use of unique identifiers:

(iii)

the nature of the matters being sought to be identified by the
matching process:

(iv)

the relevant information definitions:

(v)

the procedure for recognising matches:

(c)

the controls being used to ensure the continued integrity of the programme, including the procedures that have been established to confirm
the validity of matching results:

(d)

the security features included within the programme to minimise and
audit access to personal information, including the means by which the
information is to be transferred between agencies.

(3)

The technical standards established in accordance with subclause (1) shall be
incorporated in a written document (in this clause called a Technical Standards
Report), and copies of the Technical Standards Report shall be held by all
agencies that are involved in the authorised information matching programme.

(4)

Variations may be made to a Technical Standards Report by way of a Variation
Report appended to the original report.

(5)

The agency that prepares a Technical Standards Report shall forward a copy of
that report, and of every Variation Report appended to that report, to the Commissioner.

(6)

The Commissioner may from time to time direct that a Technical Standards
Report be varied, and every such direction shall be complied with by the
agency that prepared the report.

(7)

Every agency involved in an authorised information matching programme shall
comply with the requirements of the associated Technical Standards Report
(including any variations made to the report).

5

Safeguards for individuals affected by results of programmes

(1)

The agencies involved in an authorised information matching programme shall
establish reasonable procedures for confirming the validity of discrepancies
before any agency seeks to rely on them as a basis for action in respect of an
individual.

(2)

Subclause (1) shall not apply if the agencies concerned consider that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the results are not likely to be in error, and in
forming such a view regard shall be had to the consistency in content and context of the information being matched.

(3)

Where such confirmation procedures do not take the form of checking the
results against the source information, but instead involve direct communication with the individual affected, the agency that seeks to rely on the discrepancy as a basis for action in respect of an individual shall notify the individual

144

Reprinted as at
1 December 2020

Privacy Act 1993

Schedule 4

affected that no check has been made against the information which formed the
basis for the information supplied for the programme.
(4)

Every notification in accordance with subclause (3) shall include an explanation of the procedures that are involved in the examination of a discrepancy
revealed by the programme.

6

Destruction of information

(1)

Personal information that is disclosed, pursuant to an information matching
provision, to an agency for use in an authorised information matching programme and that does not reveal a discrepancy shall be destroyed as soon as
practicable by that agency.

(2)

Where—
(a)

personal information is disclosed, pursuant to an information matching
provision, to an agency for use in an authorised information matching
programme; and

(b)

that information reveals a discrepancy,—

that information shall be destroyed by that agency as soon as practicable after
that information is no longer needed by that agency for the purposes of taking
any adverse action against any individual.
(3)

Nothing in this clause applies in relation to the Inland Revenue Department.

7

No new databank

(1)

Subject to subclauses (2) and (3), the agencies involved in an authorised information matching programme shall not permit the information used in the programme to be linked or merged in such a way that a new separate permanent
register or databank of information is created about all or any of the individuals
whose information has been subject to the programme.

(2)

Subclause (1) does not prevent an agency from maintaining a register of individuals in respect of whom further inquiries are warranted following a discrepancy revealed by the programme, but information relating to an individual may
be maintained on such a register only for so long as is necessary to enable
those inquiries to be carried out, and in no case longer than is necessary to
enable any adverse action to be taken against an individual.

(3)

Subclause (1) does not prevent an agency from maintaining a register for the
purpose of excluding individuals from being selected for investigation, but
such register shall contain the minimum amount of information necessary for
that purpose.

8

Time limits

(1)

Where an authorised information matching programme is to continue for any
period longer than 1 year, or for an indefinite period, the agencies involved in

145

Schedule 4

Privacy Act 1993

Reprinted as at
1 December 2020

the programme shall establish limits on the number of times that matching is
carried out pursuant to the programme in each year of its operation.
(2)

The limits established in accordance with subclause (1) shall be stated in writing in an annex to the Technical Standards Report prepared in respect of the
programme pursuant to clause 4.

(3)

The limits established in accordance with subclause (1) may be varied from
time to time by the agencies involved in the programme.
