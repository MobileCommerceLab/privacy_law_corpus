National Data Governance Interim Regulations

1. Introduction
Government data represents a national asset that can enhance performance and productivity and facilitate public
services delivery. This can be achieved by instituting effective data management practices, establishing the highest
levels of data accountability and transparency, and leveraging data to extract insights and support strategic
decision making. Nations around the world are harnessing the value of data as a vital economic resource for
unlocking innovation, driving economic growth and transformation, and improving national competitiveness.
Government entities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia collect and process vast amounts of data that can contribute
to the national economic prosperity and leadership among global data-driven economies.
To drive full value realization from national data assets, data sharing is a foundational principle to establish
synergies across government entities and avoid data duplication, inconsistencies, and multiple sources in absence
of clarity regarding the single source of truth. This requires data classification against defined levels of
confidentiality for balancing between the benefits and risks associated with data sharing among entities in the
public, private, or third sector. Data classification is a pre-requisite for identifying and publishing open data,
making publicly classified information available, and exchanging protected data that includes personal data. This
increases the level of public scrutiny standards against the performance of public entities, enhances transparency,
fosters integrity and removal of unnecessary secrecy on public entities„ activities, supported by adequate
procedures for the right to access public information otherwise known as Freedom of Information.
With the technological advancement and ease of access and sharing of data, personal data protection is becoming
increasingly more critical which has instigated most countries around the world to release laws and regulations for
collecting, processing, and sharing of personal data to protect individuals„ right to privacy and to govern national
data sovereignty.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is paving towards a new era under the National Vision 2030, enhancing
Government effectiveness and transparency, fostering economic diversification powered by digital and data,
playing a larger role in the global economy, founded on public trust and international partnerships.
From this standpoint, the National Data Management Office (NDMO), as the national regulator of data in the
Kingdom, has developed the framework for national data governance to set the policies and regulations required
for data classification, data sharing, data privacy, Freedom of Information, open data and others in anticipation of
necessary legislation. Considering the relationship and interdependencies of these policies and regulations as
presented in Figure 1 below across the data lifecycle, NDMO has collated this Interim Regulations document to
cover rules and obligations related to data classification, data sharing, data privacy, Freedom of Information, and
open data.

4. Data Classification Interim Regulations
4.1. Scope
The Data Classification Interim Regulations applies to all data received, produced, or managed by public entities
regardless of its source, form, or nature. This includes paper records, emails, information stored on computers,
audio or video cassettes, microfiche, maps, photographs, handwritten notes or any other form of recorded
information.

4.2. Key Principles
Principle 1: Open by Default
Data should be accessible (in development sectors) unless its nature or sensitivity requires a higher level of
classification and protection; and top secret (in the political and security sectors) unless its nature or sensitivity
requires a lower level of classification and protection.
Principle 2: Classification Based on Necessity
Where data must be classified, the level of classification, and the safeguards and controls associated with the
classification level, should be based on the potential adverse impact as a result of unauthorized disclosure,
subject to the nature and sensitivity of the data.
Principle 3: Timely Classification
Data should be classified upon creation or upon being received from another entity and the classification
exercise should be timebound.
Principle 4: Highest Level of Protection
If information includes an integrated set of data with different classification levels, the highest classification
level should be applied to the aggregated data.
Principle 5: Segregation of Duties
Duties of participants in the classification process should not overlap in terms of classifying data, approving a
classification decision, granting authorization for access or usage of data, accessing data, protecting data, or
disposal of data – in a way that does not lead to overlapping specialization or dissipation of liability.
Principle 6: Need to Know
Access to data should be provided only if there is legitimate requirement for usage of the data based on
authorization and access controls and for the least number of people possible.
Principle 7: Least Privilege
Access to and use of data should be limited to the minimal access required to satisfy the needs of the assigned.

Data classified as “Confidential” can be further classified into one of the following sub-levels based on the impact
of unauthorized access or disclosure as follows:
- Confidential – Category (A): if the impact is at the scale of a sector or across a general economic activity
- Confidential – Category (B): if the impact cuts across the activities of multiple entities or the interests of
a group of individuals
- Confidential – Category (C): if the impact relates to the activity of a single entity or the interest of a
specific individual
In establishing the appropriate classification levels, any and all potential risks should be considered from
unauthorized access or disclosure of the data or its content and the table below illustrates many of the applicable
factors (for more information on the impact assessment process, the “Data Classification Process” section provides
further details).

Table 2: Data Classification Impact Assessment Categories and Levels

4.4. Data Classification Controls
Based on the data classification levels, appropriate data handling and protection controls shall be identified and
implemented by entities to ensure secure handling, processing, sharing and disposal of data. If data is not
classified at the time of creation or receipt as per the classification criteria, it shall be treated as “Confidential”
until correctly classified.
Data Classification controls include but are not limited to (refer to the data protection controls and guidelines
published by the National Cybersecurity Authority):
Protective Marking
 Protective marking – whether graphics or text – should be applied to paper and electronic documents
(including emails) as per each classification level to provide the appropriate protection.
Access
 Access to data – logical and physical – shall be provided based on principles of “Least Privilege” and
“Need-to-Know”.
 Access must be revoked as soon as an individual„s employment is terminated, reassigned, or suspended.
Usage
 Classified information shall be used as per the classification levels usage requirements. For example, “Top
Secret” information shall only be used within specified locations whether physical (e.g. offices) or virtual
(e.g. using cryptography or special applications).

21

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

Storage
 “Top Secret”, “Secret” and “Confidential” data, or a mobile device that processes, stores or communicates
“Top Secret”, “Secret” and “Confidential” data shall not be left unattended.
 Unattended “Top Secret”, “Secret” and “Confidential” data shall be protected while in storage either
physically or electronically through National Cybersecurity Authority approved encryption mechanisms.
Data Sharing
 Entities shall decide on the physical and digital means of data sharing that ensure security, minimization
of risk and compliance with Data Sharing regulations.
 Entities shall agree on the delivery model for Data Sharing, whether entities will utilize existing sharing
mediums, e.g. Government Service Bus, National Information Center Network, or Secured Government
Network, or will set up a new direct connection through wire, removable storage media, Wi-Fi, remote
access / VPN, API, etc.
Retention
 A schedule defining the retention period of all data shall be maintained.
 The retention period shall be defined considering the applicable business, contractual, regulatory and
legal requirements.
 The retention schedule shall be reviewed periodically – not less than annually – or when there are
changes in applicable requirements.
Disposal
 All data shall be securely disposed of – in conformance with applicable Data Disposal Regulations –
according to the retention schedule only after approval from the relevant Business Data Executive.
 “Top Secret”, “Secret” electronically controlled data shall be disposed using electronic media disposal
methods.
 All paper-based data shall be disposed of using cross shredder.
 A detailed log of all disposed of data shall be maintained.
Archival
 Data shall be archived in secure storage locations in the format recommended by the relevant Business
Data Executive.
 Archived data shall be backed up.
 Archived “Top Secret” and “Secret” data shall be protected using National Cybersecurity Authority
approved encryption mechanisms.
 A list of users authorized to access archived information shall be defined and documented.
Declassification
 Data must be declassified or downgraded when classification duration expires, or protection is no longer
required at the original level.
22

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

 In case data has been wrongly classified, the data user must notify the Business Data Executive regarding
the need to appropriately re-classify it.
 Data declassification triggers should be set when the initial classification is applied and should be
captured in the data register. Triggers may include:
o A set period after data creation or receipt (e.g. two years after creation)
o A set period after the last action on an asset (e.g. six months after last use)
o After a specific date has passed (e.g. to be reviewed on Jan 1st, 2021)
o After circumstances that have a direct impact on the data change significantly (e.g. a change of
strategic priorities or a change in government entities„ employees).
 Declassification or creation of lower classification versions of data, outside of clear triggers, requires a
sound understanding of both the sensitive data content and its context.

4.5. Data Classification Process
Step 1 – Identify all entity„s data
The first step is to inventory all the data controlled by the entity.
Step 2 – Assign responsible of performing data classification
Upon completion of an inventory, the Entity must assign responsibility for performing the classification. It is
usually the Business Data Executive, the person inside the organization who best understands the data, the one
that should be responsible of making the initial classification. As there could be several Business Data
Executives within the Entity, there could be more than one classifier.
Step 3 – Conduct impact assessment process
The Business Data Executive must follow an impact assessment process of the potential damages that could
arise from:
 The disclosure of or the unauthorized access to such data,
 And/or unauthorized amendment or destruction of such data,
 And/or lack of access to such data in a timely manner.
The impact assessment process shall be initiated with the mindset of the ‘Open by Default„ principle (in the
Development sector) unless its nature or sensitivity requires higher level of classification or protection; and
Top Secret (in the Political and Security sectors) unless the nature or sensitivity requires lower level of
classification.
Step 3.a – Identify the category impacted:
The first stage of the impact assessment process is to identify the impact that the compromise of the data
could have on any of the following categories and subcategories:
 The national interest
23

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

 The organizations
 The individuals
 The environment
Step 3.b – Identify the level of the impact:
The second stage implies that the Business Data Executive must assign to each potential damage identified a
level of impact. The impact level depends on:
 The impact duration and the difficulty to control the damage
 The time to recovery after the damage is caused
 The size of the impact (on a national level, regional, several entities, single entity, multiple individuals,
etc.)
These parameters define the four levels of impact:
 High Impact – The compromise of such data could to cause extremely grave or critical damage and longterm nonrecoverable distress.
 Medium Impact – The compromise of such data could cause considerable or serious damage difficult to
control or recover from in the short term.
 Low Impact – The compromise of such data could potentially lead to controlled or intermittent damages
in the short-term and which are easy to control.
 No Impact – The compromise of such data is unlikely to cause any damage in the long or short term.
All risks identified through the impact assessment process should be specific and evidence-based, trying to
limit the subjectivity of the person classifying the data .
Based on the identified impacts and their levels, the Business Data Executive shall assign a data classification
level:
 High Impact -> data shall be classified as “Top Secret”
 Medium Impact -> data shall be classified as “Secret”
 Low Impact -> further assessments need to be considered (refer to Step 4 and 5)
 None -> data shall be classified as “Public”
A detailed description of the key considerations for each impact category and level is outlined in Table 2 ‘Data
Classification Impact Assessment Categories and Levels.„
Consider step 4 and 5 whenever impact level identified is Low.
Go to step 6 if data has been classified as “Top Secret”, “Secret” or “Public.”
Step 4 – Consider compliance with existing regulations (only if impact level is Low)
When the impact level identified is Low and to maximize the data classified as “Public”, additional
assessments must be performed.
In this regard, the Business Data Executive must study whether the release of such data would conflict with
the Kingdom„s regulations including but not limited to the Anti-Cybercrime Law and the e-Commerce Law. If
24

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

the disclosure of the data would be against the laws and regulations, data should be classified as
“Confidential”, otherwise the Business Data Executive must continue to step 5.
Step 5 – Assess benefits of disclosure against potential negative impacts (only if the answer to step 4 is “NO”)
After assigning a low level of impact and ensuring the disclosure of the data will not imply the breach of any
existing law or regulation, entities must also assess the potential benefits of release of such data and consider
whether those would outweigh the negative impacts. Potential benefits include the usage of the data for the
development of new added-value services, an increased transparency of the government operations or
greater involvement of the citizens with the government.
 If benefits > negative impacts -> data shall be classified as “Public”
 If benefits < negative impacts -> data shall be classified as “Confidential”
Step 6 – Review of classification level
The data classification reviewer – from the entity„s data management office – must check all classified data to
ensure the classification level assigned by the Business Data Executive is the most appropriate one. The
review should take place within one month of the initial classification.
Step 7 – Apply controls
The last step of the data classification process is to ensure all data is protected as per its classification level by
applying the relevant controls (refer to section ‘Data Classification Controls„).
The classification exercise is presumed to be concluded when 100% of the data owned by the entity is
classified, its classification levels are verified, and the relevant controls are applied.
Post data classification, entities can share that data with other entities or make it available / publish it as open
data in case the classification level is “Public.”
The described process is illustrated in Figure 2.

Data Sharing
Interim Regulations

34

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

6. Data Sharing Interim Regulations
6.1. Scope
The Data Sharing Interim Regulations applies to all government data to share the data that is produced by these
entities – with other public entities, private sector, or individuals – regardless of its source, form, or nature. This
includes paper records, emails, information stored on computers, audio or video cassettes, microfiche, maps,
photographs, handwritten notes or any other form of recorded information.
These Interim Regulations do not apply to sharing of private sector or individuals„ data or data requests made by
a governmental agency for security or judicial purpose.

6.2. Key Principles
Principle 1: Data Sharing Culture
All Government entities act as a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for the data they produce. Hence, entities shall
request data from SSOTs directly to avoid its duplication, inaccuracy, and storage in multiple sources rather than
recreating it themselves or requesting from third parties. If the request to share data is submitted to the entity
that acts as a data custodian of Government data and is not its SSOT, then a permission to share from SSOT is
mandatory.
Principle 2: Clear Purpose for Data Sharing
The Data Requestor should clearly state the reason or legal basis behind the request for sharing data - except for
data and entities exempted by a Royal Decree. Data should only be shared when it delivers a public benefit and
would not inflict harm against national interests, organizations, individuals, or the environment.
Principle 3: Authorized Access
All parties involved in Data Sharing should have the appropriate authority (security clearance might be needed
based on the nature and sensitivity of the data), knowledge, and skills along with properly trained staff to
handle shared data.
Principle 4: Transparency
All parties involved in Data Sharing should make available all information that is necessary for the successful
delivery of the Data Sharing purpose including required data, purpose behind data sharing request, data transfer
and storage mechanism, data security controls, and data disposal mechanism.
Principle 5: Collective Accountability
All parties involved in Data Sharing should be held accountable for Data Sharing decisions, for processing it
according to the defined purposes, and for taking the necessary actions to ensure data quality and
implementation of security controls as defined in the Data Sharing agreement and as prescribed by relevant
national laws and regulations.

35

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

Principle 6: Data Security
All parties involved in Data Sharing should have an adequate set of security controls to protect and safeguard
data and enable a secure environment for Data Sharing in line with relevant national laws and regulations, and
in line with the National Cybersecurity Authority requirements.
Principle 7: Ethical Data Use
All parties involved in Data Sharing should apply ethical practices throughout the Data Sharing process to
ensure fairness, integrity, trust, and respect, and go beyond meeting data protection and security standards or
other regulatory requirements.

6.3. Data Sharing Process
The Data Sharing process has been designed to provide guidance to public entities on the standardization of
sharing practices to ensure all necessary controls and requirements are met . The Data Sharing Process,
graphically depicted in Figure 3 below, should be completed within three (3) month of the initial request, has
the following steps:
1. The Data Sharing process starts with a Data Sharing request from the data requestor – public sector,
private sector, or individual - submitted to the receiving entity„s data management office.
2. The receiving entity„s office forwards the Data Sharing request to the relevant Business Data Executive
who then assigns one of the reporting Business Data Stewards to manage and evaluate the Data Sharing
request.
3. The Business Data Steward first checks the classification level of requested data:
a. If the classification level is not assigned, then the entity„s office – that has received the data
sharing request - must get the requested data classified according to the Data Classification
Interim Regulations
b. When the classification level is assigned as ‘Public„, the Business Data Steward can release
requested data without assessing conformance to the Data Sharing principles
c. If the classification level is assigned as ‘Confidential„, ‘Secret„ or ‘Top Secret„, then the Business
Data Steward must assess conformance to the Data Sharing principles.
4. The Business Data Steward shall continue the data sharing process only if all Data Sharing principles are
satisfied.
5. If one or more Data Sharing principles are not fully satisfied, the Business Data Steward cannot proceed
with the Data Sharing. Nevertheless, the Business Data Steward should return to the data requestor with
the outcome of the evaluation reflecting the proper justification and give an additional chance to satisfy
all principles.
6. When all Data Sharing Principles are satisfied, the Business Data Steward must get the Business Data
Executive„s approval to proceed with the process.
36

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

7. The Business Data Steward defines and sets the required controls that satisfy Data Sharing principles and
meet the objectives set for each. The Business Data Steward must agree with the data requestor and all
other parties that might be involved in the Data Sharing process on implementing these controls.
8. After agreeing on the Data Sharing controls and their implementation, the Business Data Steward should
detail them in the Data Sharing Agreement that all parties involved in the sharing process should sign.
9. Finally, once the Data Sharing Agreement is signed, the entity„s office shares the data with the Data
Requestor.

Figure 3 – Data Sharing Process

6.4. Data Sharing Timeline
After receiving a Data Sharing request, the public entity has 30 days to evaluate it, assess if all Data Sharing
Principles are satisfied, formulate a written decision whether to share the data, and communicate it to the data
requestor along with the proper justification (steps 2-4 of the Data Sharing process presented above).
If the decision is not to share the data, the data requestor is entitled to improve on non-compliant principles and
appeal the Business Data Steward to re-evaluate the updated Data Sharing request. In that case, the Business
Data Steward has 14 days to re-assess the request and provide a final decision (step 5 of the Data Sharing
process).
After obtaining an approval from the Business Data Executive to proceed with Data Sharing (step 6 of the Data
Sharing process), the Business Data Steward shall govern the design and implementation of Data Sharing
controls which should not take longer than 60 days from the time the Business Data Executive provided the
approval (step 7 of the Data Sharing process).
37

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

After signing the Data Sharing Agreement (step 8 of the Data Sharing process), the Data Steward has 7 days
from the data of signing the Agreement to share the data with the data requestor (step 9 of the Data Sharing
process).

6.5. Data Sharing Controls
All parties involved in the process should agree on data sharing controls necessary to appropriately manage and
secure the shared data.
Legal Basis:
(Supported by Principle 1 – Data Sharing Culture, Principle 2 – Clear Purpose for Data Sharing, Principle 5 –
Collective Accountability, Principle 7 – Ethical Data Use)
o Clearly explain the lawful basis or need for sharing the data (e.g. entity mandate, royal decree allowing
entity to share data, signed agreements).
o State how Intellectual Property Rights, Data Classification, and Data Privacy regulations would be
preserved.
Authorization
(Supported by Principle 3 – Authorized Access, Principle 6 – Data Security)
o Define who are the individuals authorized to request and share data (check compliance with Data
Classification Interim Regulations for usage and access controls).
Data Type
(Supported by Principle 1 – Data Sharing Culture, Principle 2 – Clear Purpose for Data Sharing, Principle 4 –
Transparency)
o Check that the Sharing Entity is the SSOT for requested data (has the master data) to ensure data is being
requested from the right source.
o Specify the minimum volume of data needed to satisfy the purpose of the sharing request.
o Specify the type and format of the shared data and the requirements related to editing/changing them
(e.g. data format, level of detail, structured or unstructured, raw data, processed data).
Data Preprocessing
(Supported by Principle 6 – Data Security)
o Decide if any data preprocessing is required before sharing and if so, then agree and detail out the
processing techniques used e.g. masking, anonymization, aggregation (as long as this does not impact the
content of the data).
38

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

o Evaluate the quality of requested data and decide if it requires an improvement before sharing. If needed,
the entity„s office should prepare and cleanse the data before sharing it.
Means of Data Sharing
(Supported by Principle 6 – Data Security)

7.7. Freedom of Information and Open data
Open data programs and policies have been launched around the world to support growth of the national
economy and innovation agenda. Making specific datasets available for public access and use has benefited
researchers, innovators, other members of the public and even companies and helped create a conductive
environment for business growth, promoting an open and transparent government.
Driving an open data program also represents the proactiveness of a public entity in upholding the right to
access public information and making specific datasets open ahead of being requested. As such, it is expected
that effective open data programs can be correlated with less Freedom of Information requests, potentially
lowering government expenses.

8. Open data Interim Regulations
8.1. Scope
The scope of the Open data Interim Regulations covers all data and public information – unprotected –
produced by public entities regardless of source, form, or nature. This includes paper records, emails,
information stored on computers, audio or video cassettes, microfiche, maps, photographs, handwritten notes
or any other form of recorded information.

8.2. Key Principles
Principle 1: Open by Default
This principle ensures that the Government avail most of its data to the public by default unless there is
sufficient justification that non-disclosure of data is of greater public interest.
Principle 2: Open Format and Machine-Readable
Datasets should be made publicly accessible in a machine-readable format that allows automated processing.
Data should be stored in widely used file formats (such as CSV, XLS, JSON, XML) that facilitate machine
processing.
Principle 3: Up to Date
Open datasets should be regularly published in their most recent state and should be made available to the
public in a timely fashion. Whenever feasible, data collected by the Government should be released as quickly
as it is gathered. Priority should be given to data whose utility is time sensitive.
Principle 4: Comprehensive
Open datasets should be as complete and as granular as possible, reflecting what is recorded, in compliance
with the National Data Privacy Regulation. Metadata that defines and explains the raw data should be included
with explanations or formulas for how data was derived or calculated.
Principle 5: Non-discriminatory
Datasets shall be available to anyone without discrimination or requirement for registration. Any person should
be able to access open data published at any time without having to identify him/herself or to provide
justification for gaining access.
Principle 6: Free of Charge
Open data should be made available to the public free of charge.
Principle 7: KSA Open data License
Open data should be subject to the Kingdom„s Open data License that provides the legal basis for Open data
usage while defining the conditions, obligations, and restrictions applicable to the user. Any usage of Open data
indicates acceptance of the License terms.

50

National Data Governance Interim Regulations

Principle 8: For Improved Governance and Citizen Engagement
Open data should enable informed civic participation and reinforce governments„ transparency and
accountability to improve decision-making and enhance the provision of public services.
Principle 9: For Inclusive Development and Innovation
Entities should play an active role in promoting the reuse of Open data and providing the necessary supporting
resources and expertise. Entities should actively work on empowering a future generation of Open data
innovators and engaging individuals, organizations, and the general public in unlocking the value of Open data.

8.3. Assessing Data Value for Defining Open datasets
The key phases for assessing data value (or the data valuation process) to enable the publication of open
datasets at scale is presented as follows:
Step 1: Identifying the Data and Public Information Inventory
To assess data value, the public entity should classify data (in line with the Data Classification Interim
Regulations) and identify all “publicly” classified datasets that may constitute files or tables or specific records in
a database, etc. After, the benefits, applications, and potential usage for every dataset should be defined. It is
possible to consider the data domain or sector when analyzing potential use cases, for example, GIS data can
benefit the health sector. In addition, it is possible to consider data sources: data collected from users directly,
data automatically collected through recorded events such as electronic transactions, aggregated data, or data
developed from combining data, etc.
Step 2: Assessing Data Value
After identifying the datasets in the previous step, the main factors related to the usefulness of the data are
analyzed which play a critical role in assessing its value, such as data completeness, accuracy, consistency,
timeliness, restrictions, exclusivity, potential risks from publication, or ability to access and integrate with other
data.
Step 3: Identifying Potential Stakeholders
After assessing the data value in the previous step, potential stakeholders are identified whether entities or
individuals across the value chain, for example, it is possible to publish consumer trends to product
manufacturers not just to department stores. Therefore, it is important to understand the key drivers for
stakeholders, whether for example it relates to generating revenue by developing data products or
implementing services for the public benefit such as for improving quality of life.
After the data valuation process, the open data lifecycle may starts as described in what follows.
