Proclamation No.414/2004

THE CRIMINAL CODE OF
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
PREFACE
It is nearly half a century since the 1957 Penal Code entered into
operation. During this period, radical political, economic and social
changes have taken place in Ethiopia. Among the major changes are
the recognition by the Constitution and international agreements
ratified by Ethiopia of the equality between religions, nations,
nationalities and peoples, the democratic rights and freedoms of
citizens and residents, human rights, and most of all, the rights of
social groups like women and children. After all these phenomena have
taken place, it would be inappropriate to allow the continuance of the
enforcement of the 1949 Penal Code.
Another discernible gap in the Penal Code is its failure to properly
address crimes born of advances in technology and the complexities of
modern life. The Penal Code does not incorporate crimes such as the
hijacking of aircraft, computer crimes and money laundering. Besides,
as regards crimes related to corruption and drugs although they are
nowadays,
attracting attention both in legislation and follow-up not only within
national frontiers but also on the regional and international levels, due
to the grave crises they are using, the Penal code does not adequately
deal with such crimes with the degree of seriousness they deserve.
Another point that should not be overlooked is the penal Code's failure
to acknowledge the grave injuries and sufferings caused to women and
children by reason of harmful traditional practices. Surely, the
constitution guarantees respect for the cultures of peoples, but it does
not buttress up those practices scientifically proven to be harmful. It is
also futile to issue a law that does not have the trust and support of the
people for it usually remains impracticable. But it is well recognized in
the philosophy of criminal legislation that the legislature should, by
adopting progressive laws at times, educate and guide the public to
dissociate itself from harmful traditional practices.
Furthermore, it is desirable to adopt a comprehensive code by
assembling the various criminal provisions published in the Negarit
Gazeta in a disintegrated manner. Similarly, since the parallel
application, of the regular Penal Code and the Revised special Penal
Code in respect of similar matters disregards equality among citizens,

the existence of a comprehensive Criminal Code will put an end to such
practice.
In order to eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings and adopt a
comprehensive Criminal code, substantial activities have been
undertaken throughout the entire Country. Discussions have been held
on the draft Criminal Code prepared by the Ministry of Justice and the
Justice and Legal System Research Institute. Legal and medical
professionals, psychiatrists, different institutions of higher education
and professional associations have made significant contributions
through the opinions they gave to the enactment of the law.
Representatives of the people selected from different sectors and
associations have forwarded important views in discussion forums on
the draft laws conducted in Addis Ababa and the regions. It is mainly
on the basis of public opinion that punishments have increased in
respect of crimes like rape and aggravated theft. Moreover, the opinions
of legal scholars and the laws and experiences of foreign countries have
been consulted to enrich the content of the Criminal Code.
Finally, one point that must not be left unmentioned is the matter
concerning the determination of sentence. Since it is essential to
facilitate the method by which Courts can pass similar punishments on
similar cases, some major changes have been made in the provisions of
the
Code.
Provisions of the Penal Code that used to make sentencing complicated
and difficult have been amended. Provisions have been inserted which
enable the Courts to pass the appropriate penalty for each case by
carefully examining from the lightest to the most severe punishment. A
sentencing manual will also be issued to ensure and control the
correctness and uniformity of sentencing.
Another point which must be raised in connection with the
determination of sentence is that the purpose of Criminal Law is to
preserve the peace and security of society. It protects society by
preventing the commission of crimes, and a major means of preventing
the commission of crime is punishment.
Punishment can deter wrongdoers from committing other crimes; it can
also serve as a warning to prospective wrongdoers. Although
imprisonment and death are enforced in respect of certain crimes the
main objective is temporarily or permanently to prevent wrongdoers
from committing further crimes against society. And in such cases with
the exception of the death sentence even criminals sentenced to life
imprisonment can be released on parole before serving the whole term;
in certain crimes convicts can be released on probation without the
pronouncement of sentence or without the enforcement of the sentence
pronounced. This helps wrongdoers to lead a peaceful life and it
indicates the major place, which the Criminal Law has allocated for
their rehabilitation.
The fact that wrongdoers, instead of being made to suffer while in
prison, take vocational training and participate in academic education,
which would benefit them upon their release, reaffirms the great

concern
envisaged by the Criminal Code about the reform of criminals.
It must be noted that, by laying down in the Code express provisions
concerning these cases, it is intended that Courts should, on passing
sentence, take into account the purpose of the law and the different
aims of punishment.
It is hoped that this Criminal Code, which has been revised through all
these persistent efforts, will ensure respect for the order, peace and
security of the State and its peoples as well as respect for the rights
and freedoms of its citizens and inhabitants.
Being convinced that this Code will enable to accelerate the economic
progress of the State, that it will strengthen a steady order of free
market and that it will, above all, contribute towards the promotion of a
fair judicial system, in our country, pursuant to Article 55 (1) of the
Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia it is hereby
proclaimed as follows:
1. Short Title:
This Proclamation may be cited as "The Criminal Code of the
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia 2004."

Administration Council 1982, Proclamation No. 214/1982, are
hereby repealed as from the 9th of May, 2005.
3. Special Case:
As provided in Article 3 of this Code, nothing shall affect the
application of special laws and regulations.

Federal Negarit Gazeta under Proclamation No. 414/2004, shall

Article 1.- Object and Purpose.
The purpose of the Criminal Code of the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia is to ensure order, peace and the security of
the State, its peoples, and inhabitants for the public good.
It aims at the prevention of crimes by giving due notice of the
crimes and penalties prescribed by law and should this be
ineffective by providing for the punishment of criminals in order
to deter them from committing another crime and make them a
lesson to others, or by providing for their reform and measures to
prevent the commission of further crimes.
Article 2.-

Principle of Legality.

(1) Criminal law specifies the various crimes, and the penalties and
measures applicable to criminals.
(2) The Court may not treat as a crime and punish any act or
omission which is not prohibited by law. The Court may not
impose penalties or measures other than those prescribed by
law.
(3) The Court may not create crimes by analogy,
(4) The above provisions shall not prevent the Court from
interpreting the law. In cases of doubt the Court shall interpret
the law according to its spirit, in accordance with the meaning
intended by the legislature so as to achieve the purpose it has in
view.
(5) Nobody shall be tried or punished again for the same crime for
which he has been already convicted, punished or subjected to
other measures or acquitted by a final decision in accordance
with the law.
Article 3.- Other Penal Legislation.
Nothing in this Code shall affect regulations and special laws of a
criminal nature:
Provided that the general principles embodied in this Code are
applicable to those regulations and laws except as otherwise
expressly provided therein.

Criminal law applies to all alike without discrimination as
regards persons, social conditions, race, nation, nationality,
social origin, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
opinion, property, birth or other status.
No difference in treatment of criminals may be made except as
provided by this Code, which are derived from immunities
sanctioned by public international and constitutional law, or
relate to the gravity of the crime or the degree of guilt, the age,
circumstances or special personal characteristics of the criminal,
and the social danger which he represents.

TITLE II
THE CRIME AND ITS COMMISSION
CHAPTER I
THE CRIME
Article 23.- Crimes.

(1) A crime is an act, which is prohibited and made punishable by
law.
In this Code, an act consists of the commission of what is
prohibited or the omission of what is prescribed by law.
(2) A crime is only completed when all its legal, material and moral
ingredients are present.
(3) Notwithstanding the provision of sub-article (2) of this Article, a
juridical person shall be criminally liable to punishment under
the conditions laid down in Article 34 of this Code.
(4) A crime is punishable where the Court has found the crime
proved and deserving of punishment.
Article 24.-

Relationship of Cause and Effect.

(1) In all cases where the commission of a crime requires the
achievement of a given result, the crime shall not be deemed to
have been committed unless the result achieved is the
consequence of the act or omission with which the accused
person is charged.
This relationship of cause and effect shall be presumed to exist
when the act within the provisions of the law would, in the
normal course of things, produce the result charged.
(2) Where there are preceding, concurrent or intervening causes,
whether due to the act of a third party or to a natural or
fortuitous event, which are extraneous to the act of the accused,
this relationship of cause and effect shall cease to exist when the
extraneous cause in itself produced the result.
If, in such a case, the act with which the accused person is
charged in itself constitutes a crime he shall be liable to the
punishment specified for such a crime.
(3) Relationship of cause and effect shall be presumed to exist
between each cause specified under sub-article (2) above and the
result achieved, when the result is the cumulative effect of these
causes, even though each cause cannot independently produce
the result.
Article 25.- Place and Time of the Crime.
(1) A crime is committed at the place where and at the time when
the criminal performed or failed to perform the act penalized by
criminal law.
An attempt is committed at the place where and at the time when
the criminal performed or failed to perform the preliminary acts:
which constitute such an attempt.
(2) With regard to non-instantaneous crimes where the act and the
criminal result do not coincide the crime is deemed to have been
committed both at the place of the unlawful act and that of its
result.

Similarly, an attempt is deemed to have been committed both at
the place where the criminal attempted the crime and the place
he intended the result to be produced.
For purposes of prosecution, the jurisdiction of the place where
the result was achieved is subsidiary to that of the place of
commission.
(3) When a combination or repetition of criminal acts is an element
of an ordinary or aggravated crime as provided under Article 61,
or when the act is pursued over a period of time, the place where
and the time when the crime is committed shall be the place
where and the time when one of the combined or repeated acts
or part of the acts pursued is committed.

Article 123.-

document, to be an expert witness or to serve as assessor;
or

apply the following provisions having regard to the circumstances and
requirements of the case.
Article 130.- Confinement.

applying the ordinary provisions of the law (Art. 56) may reduce
the penalty within the limits it specifies (Art. 179), if the
circumstances of the case seem to justify such a reduction.

In no case may death sentence be passed upon a criminal who
had not attained his eighteenth year of age at the time of
commission of the crime (Art. 117).
In the carrying out of penalties entailing loss of liberty the rule of
segregation until majority (Art. 110(2)) shall be strictly observed.

it necessary, in particular where it is appropriate to order detention
in a penitentiary establishment (Art. 168(2)) upon release from the
corrective institution.

Section I.- Determination
Article 178.- Assessment of the Penalty in Case of Mitigation or
Aggravation Provided by Law.
Apart from ordinary cases of determination of the penalty in
conformity with general principles (Art. 88) and where, by virtue
of the law, a case arises of compulsory or optional mitigation or
aggravation of the penalty the Court shall apply the following
provisions.
Sub-section I.- Rules Governing Mitigation and Exemption
Article 179.- Ordinary Mitigation.

In all cases where the law provides that the Court mitigate the
penalty under this Article, it shall, if it deems the mitigation
justified, pronounce:
(a) instead of capital punishment, rigorous imprisonment from
twenty years to life;
(b) instead of rigorous imprisonment for life, rigorous
imprisonment from ten to twenty years;
(c) instead of rigorous imprisonment for a specified minimum
period, rigorous imprisonment for not less than the general
minimum period of one year;
(d) instead of rigorous imprisonment of at least one year, simple
imprisonment from six months to five years;
(e) instead of simple imprisonment for a specified minimum
period laid down in the Special Part of this Code, simple
imprisonment for not less than the general minimum period of
ten days;
(f) instead of simple imprisonment for not less than the general
minimum period of ten days, compulsory labour or a fine.
Article 180.-

Free Mitigation.

In cases where the law provides the mitigation without restriction
of the penalty under this Article, whether compulsorily or
optionally, the Court shall have power to determine it in
accordance with the following principles:
The Court shall not be bound by the Kind of penalty provided in
the Special Part of this Code for the crime to be tried, nor by the
minimum which the provision provides; it-may without
restriction impose a sentence for a term shorter than the
minimum period prescribed of substitute a less severe sentence
for the sentence provided; however the Court shall be bound
solely by the -genera} minimum provided in the General Part,
(Arts. 90, 106 and 108) as regards the penalty it imposes,
whatever its nature may be.
Article-181.-Common Provisions.
In exercising its power of mitigation under the conditions and
within the limits provided by law the Court shall always
determine the nature of the sentence in accordance with the
general principles governing criminal guilt (Art. 57).
In case of mitigation, whether ordinary (Art. 179) or free: (Art.
180), reparation of the damage caused (Art. 101) may always be
ordered. The same applies to secondary penalties (Arts,-121-128)
and to the various preventive, corrective and safety measures
(Arts. 134-153) which the Court may deem necessary.
Article 182.- Exemption from and Waiving of Penalty.

The Court may exempt a criminal from any penalty whatever or
waive the penalty in whole or in part, only in such cases as are
expressly provided by law.
Sub-section II.- Rules Governing Aggravation
Article 183.- Ordinary Aggravation.
In general cases of aggravation provided by law (Art. 84) the
Court shall determine the penalty without going beyond the
maximum limit of the penalty specified in the relevant provision
of the Special Part of this Code, taking into account the nature
and the multiplicity of grounds of a aggravation, as well as the
degree of guilt of the criminal.
Article 184.Crimes.

Aggravation of Penalty in Case of Concurrent

(1) In case of material concurrence of crimes (Art. 85) the Court
shall determine the penalty on the basis of the general rules set
out hereafter, taking into account, for the assessment of the
sentence, the degree of guilt of the criminal:
(a) where capital punishment or life imprisonment is determined
for one of the concurrent crimes punishable with deprivation of
life or liberty or where the maximum term of imprisonment
provided under the provisions of this General Part (Arts. 106 and
108) is imposed for one of the concurrent crimes punishable
with imprisonment of the same kind, this penalty shall, subject
to the provisions of sub-article 1 (c) and (e) of this Article override
any other penalties that would have been imposed on the other
concurrent crimes.
However if, instead of one of the penalties specified above, a
sentence of imprisonment below the maximum laid down in the
General Part of this Code has been passed for the most serious
crime, the Court shall aggravate the sentence on account of the
other concurrent crimes in accordance with sub-article (1) (b) of
this Article.
(b) in case of two or more concurrent crimes entailing loss of
liberty the appropriate penalty for each crime shall be determined
and added. However, the duration of the total penalty may not go
beyond the general maximum fixed in the General Part of this
Code for the king of penalty applied.
In case of concurrent crimes entailing simple imprisonment and
rigorous imprisonment, simple imprisonment of two years shall,
for purposes of this Article, be deemed to be equivalent to
rigorous imprisonment of one year.
(c) in case of concurrence between a penalty entailing loss of
liberty and a fine the Court may impose both penalties. When

imposing the sentence it shall apply the provision of sub- article
(1)(b) in case of imprisonment, and the provision of sub-article
(1 )(d) in case of fine.
(d) in case of two or more concurrent crimes entailing fine the
appropriate penalty for each fine shall be determined and added.
Without prejudice to cases where the criminal acted for gain
(Art.92), the total amount may not, exceed the general maximum
prescribed in the General Part of this Code.
(e) where the Court orders the forfeiture of the criminal's property
in case of one of the concurrent crimes, it may not impose a fine
on account of the other crime.
(2) Where there exists concurrence of crimes as defined in Article
60(c) of this Code the punishment shad, unless otherwise
provided, be determined in accordance with the provisions of
sub-article (1) of this Article.
(3) Any secondary penalty or preventive, corrective or safety
measure may be applied even though its application is justified
under only one of the relevant provisions or in respect of only
one of the concurrent crimes.
Article 185.- Special Case.
(1) In case of related crimes, when one of them was committed with
the intent of making possible, facilitating or cloaking another
crime, the Court shall aggravate to the maximum permitted by
law the penalty determined under the preceding Articles.
(2) Where such concurrence constitutes a special aggravated crime
such as aggravated murder or robbery according to the Special
Part of this Code, the appropriate provisions shall apply.
Article 186.-

Retrospective Concurrence.

(1) Where it is discovered that another concurrent crime had been
committed before judgment by a criminal while serving or after
having served a sentence for a crime for which he was convicted,
the Court shall assess sentence, so that the criminal is not
punished more severely than if all the crimes had been tried
together.
(2) The Court, taking into account the penalty already imposed,
shall determine the appropriate penalty in accordance with the
preceding Articles.
(3) Where different penalties have been imposed in separate trials
before different Courts or divisions on charges which should
have been tried together the aggregate sentence shall be
determined
in
accordance with the preceding Articles.
Article187.Aggravation of Penalty in Case of Notional
Concurrence.
(1) Where by one and the same act the criminal committed a breach
of several criminal provisions (notional concurrence Article 65),

the Court may aggravate the penalty according to the provisions
of Article 184 particularly where the criminal's deliberate and
calculated disregard for the law or the clear manifestation of the
criminal's bad character so justifies aggravation.
In other cases the Court may only impose the maximum penalty
prescribed by the most severe of the relevant provisions.
(2) In case of notional concurrence resulting in crimes with different
material consequences, the Court shall aggravate the penalty as
follows:
(a) where at least one of the concurrent crimes committed by
the criminal is intentional (Art. 66(1 )(a) and (b)), the
penalty shall be determined in accordance with the
provision of Article 184.
(b) where the concurrent crimes are committed negligently
(Art. 66(1)(c), a penalty shall be imposed without exceeding
the maximum penalty prescribed in the Special Part of this
Code for the most serious crime.
(c) where the criminal intentionally committed crimes
endangering public security or interest (Art. 66(2)), the
penalty shall be aggravated in accordance with the
provision of Article 184.
Article 188.- Aggravation in Case of Recidivism.
(1) Where a fresh crime is committed in the circumstances specified
under Article 67 of this Code, the Court shall aggravate the
penalty, and may pass a sentence exceeding the maximum
penalty laid down in the Special Part of this Code for the fresh
crime.
It may double the penalty provided in the Special Part of this
Code for the fresh crime or for the most serious fresh crime in
case of concurrence.
(2) Having regard to the nature and multiplicity of crimes, the degree
of guilt and the danger represented by the criminal, the Court
may, without being bound by the maximum penalty provided in
sub-article (1) above, aggravate up to the maximum penalty laid
down in the General Part of this Code for the kind of punishment
applied.
Where the criminal is a persistent recidivist the Court shall
aggravate the sentence by going beyond double the penalty
prescribed for the fresh crime.
(3) The penalty to be determined under the provisions of sub-article
(1) or (2) of this Article shall in no case exceed the maximum
penalty prescribed in the General Part of this Code for the kind of
penalty applied (Arts. 106 and 108).

Sub-section III.- Cumulation of Extenuating and Aggravating
Circumstances
Article

189.-

Cumulation of Different
Aggravating Circumstances.

Extenuating

and

In case of different extenuating and aggravating circumstances,
the Court shall determine the penalty as provided below:
(1) In the event of concurrent general aggravating and
extenuating circumstances the Court shall first fix the penalty
having regard to the aggravating circumstances (Art. 183)
and then shall reduce the penalty in light of the extenuating
circumstances (Arts. 179,180).
(2) Where in a case of recidivism the criminal has at the same
time been convicted of concurrent crimes the Court shall first
assess sentence for the concurrent crimes and then increase
it having regard to recidivism.
(3)

When there exist different types of aggravating and
extenuating circumstances specified in sub-article (1) and (2)
above, the Court shall first fix the penalty having regard to the
aggravating circumstances and then shall reduce the penalty
in light of the extenuating circumstances.

Section II. – Suspension of Penalty
Sub-section I.- Conditional Suspension of Penalty
Article 190.- Principle.
When the Court, having regard to all the circumstances of the case,
considers that conditional suspension of the penalty will promote the
reform and reinstatement of the criminal, it may order conditional
suspension of the sentence as provided hereinafter.
Such an order implies an appeal to the cooperation of the criminal for
his own reform and may at any time be revoked if circumstances show
that it is not justified.
Article 191.- Suspension of Pronouncement of the Penalty;
Suspended Sentence.
When the criminal has no previous conviction and does not appear
dangerous and where his crime is punishable with fine (Art. 90),
compulsory labour (Arts. 103 and 104) or simple imprisonment for not
more than three years (Art. 106), the Court, after having convicted the
criminal, may suspend sentence and place the criminal on probation,
where it is of the opinion that such decision will lead to the reform of
the criminal.
No conviction shall be entered when a criminal is placed on probation
and does not break the conditions of his probation.
Article 192.-

Suspension of Enforcement of the Penalty.

When the Court considers that the criminal, whether previously
sentenced or not (Art.194), shall receive a warning it shall enter a
conviction and pass sentence but may order that the
enforcement of the sentence be suspended for a specified period
of probation. The Court may not, however, suspend the
enforcement of measures (Arts. 127-159).
If the probation is successfully undergone the sentence shall be
remitted, but the conviction entered in the Judgment register
shall remain with all its other consequences.
Article 193.-

Cumulation of Penalties, Divisibility of Suspension.

If there is a cumulation of penalties, in particular when
secondary penalties are imposed, the Court may, for public
securities or general interest, decide not to extend the measure of
suspension to some of the penalties on account of their
preventive nature and the interest attaching to their
enforcement.
Article 194.- Disallowance and Withdrawal of Suspension.
(1) Suspension of the enforcement of a penalty shall not be allowed:
(a)
where the criminal has previously already undergone a
sentence of rigorous imprisonment or a sentence of simple
imprisonment for a term exceeding three years and where
he is sentenced again to one of these penalties for the
crime for which he is tried, without prejudice to the
provisions regarding recidivism (Arts. 67 and 188).
(b)
where the criminal, having not been sentenced previously,
is sentenced to a term of rigorous imprisonment exceeding
five years for the crime for which he is now tried.
(2) Similarly the Court may revoke the suspension granted:
(a)

(b)
(c)

where, after having been granted a suspension of penalty,
it is discovered that the criminal had committed a crime
and where the nature and extent of the penalty, that
would be imposed for the crime, satisfy the requirement
under sub-article (1)(a) above; or
where the criminal, having been granted suspension of
penalty, intentionally commits a fresh crime during the
period of probation Article 200 (2); or
where the Court is of the opinion that the conditional
suspension in the previous case will not produce good
results.

Article 195.-

Enquiry.

Where the Court is of the opinion that previous enquiry is
necessary for the purpose of deciding whether suspension should
be granted, it shall
require information as to antecedents,
character, living and working conditions of the criminal applying
for suspension.

Information may be given by a supervisor or a reliable welfare
worker or an officer of a charitable organization.
Article 196.-

Common

Provisions:

Period

of Probation.

(1) In choosing either of the two forms of suspension (Arts. 191 and
192), the Court shall give grounds for its decision.
It may not give an order of suspension unless the antecedents,
character and attitude of the accused afford a reasonable
presumption that the suspension will produce good results.
(2) The Court shall fix the probation period imposed upon the
criminal taking into account the gravity of his crime, the risk of a
relapse and his reliability.
The probation period shall be of at least two years and may not
exceed five years.

Article 197.- Conditions of the Probation.
(1) Conditional suspension shall follow upon the criminal entering
into a formal undertaking to be of good conduct, to accept the
requirements laid down, as well as to repair, to the fullest extent
possible, the damage caused by the crime or to pay the
indemnity to the injured person (Art. 101) as well as to pay the
judicial costs within the time therefor.
(2) The Court shall require a security for the undertaking. It may
consist in a guarantee of a personal or material nature. It shall
determine it having regard to the circumstances and the
possibilities of the case.
Article 198.- Rules of Conduct to be Imposed upon the Criminal.
(1) The Court shall specify the rules of conduct, protection and
supervision, which appear to it to be necessary.
Such rules may prescribe, in particular, the requirement of
learning a trade, residing, working or living in a particular
place, refraining from consorting with certain people or
consuming alcoholic beverages, remitting to the probationer's
family, guardian or protector part of his earnings, undergoing a
requisite treatment or subjecting himself to any other similar
measure for securing the success of the probation.
(2) Rules of
criminal's
nature of
reform, in

conduct shall take into account the individual
needs, according to the circumstances and the
the risk run and shall be famed with a view to his
accordance with the provisions of the law.

They must not be inconsistent with the aims of the institution
of suspension, nor prescribe requirements which are
incompatible with the provisions of the law.
(3) The rules of conduct laid down may be varied at the request of
the probationer, his protector, guardian or guarantor, or on the
application of the Attorney General where the necessity is
apparent.
Article 199.-

Control and Supervision.

(1) Upon granting suspension the Court shall, if it is necessary,
place the criminal under the supervision of a protector,
guardian, probation officer or a charitable organization in general
(Art. 208).
The protector or supervising officer shall keep in touch with the
probationer: he shall visit him at home or at his place of work,
make arrangements for his leisure hours, give him guidance and
facilitate to the best of his ability his readjustment in life and his
reform.
The protector or supervising officer shall exercise over the
probationer a regular but unobtrusive control and report at least
every three months and at more frequent intervals when
necessary to the appropriate probation commission.
(2) The organization and the duties of the probation commissions
and probation officers shall be regulated by law.
Article 200.- Effect of Failure of Probation.
(1) If during the period of probation the probationer infringes one of
the rules of conduct imposed upon him, evades supervision or
the authority of the charitable organization to which he is
entrusted, commits a crime by negligence or in any other
manner betrays the confidence placed in him, subject to his
being prosecuted for the crime he negligently committed, a
formal warning shall be addressed to him by the Court.
If necessary, fresh rules of conduct or the extension of the
probation period originally fixed may be imposed within the
limits permitted by law.
(2) If the probationer persists in his attitude or has conduct despite
this formal warning or if he intentionally commits a fresh crime
during the probation period the measure of suspension shall be
revoked by the Court but not before the probationer has been
given an opportunity of being heard.
A second suspension cannot be awarded for a new crime
intentionally committed.

(3) In such a case the Court shall pronounce the penalty which it
had suspended and order its enforcement or order the
enforcement of the penalty which it has imposed.
If the measure of suspension is cancelled on the ground of a
fresh and intentional crime, subject to the provisions regarding
recidivism (Art. 188), the penalty shall be aggravated by adding
the penalty for the fresh crime to the penalty pronounced or to
be pronounced.
Sub-section II.- Conditional Release
Article201.- Principle.
In all cases where a penalty or measure entailing loss of liberty
provided by this Code is imposed anticipatory conditional release
may be awarded by way of probation at the end of the period of
enforcement provided by law, when the general requirements
therefore are satisfied (Art. 202).
Conditional release must be regarded as a means of reform and
social reinstatement. It must be deserved by the criminal to
whom it is applied and must be awarded only in cases where it
affords a reasonable chance of success.
Article 202.- Conditions for Release.
(1) Where a prisoner has served two-thirds of a sentence of
imprisonment or twenty years in case of life imprisonment, the
Court may, on the recommendation of the management of the
institution or on the petition of the criminal, order conditional
release:
(a) if, during the requisite period of performance of the
penalty or the measure entailing loss of liberty, the
criminal, by his work and conduct, gave tangible proof of
his improvement; and
(b) if he has repaired, as far as he could reasonably be
expected to do, the damage found by the Court or agreed
with the aggrieved party; and
(c) if the character and behaviour of the criminal warrant the
assumption that he will be of good conduct when released
and that the measure will be effective.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, conditional release
shall not be granted to persistent recidivists.
Article 203.- Information Concerning Conditional Release.
(1) Prisoners shall be informed upon their conviction and when
entering the institution to which they are committed of the
possibility and conditions of their anticipatory release.
(2) The Director of the institution shall recommend release of the
criminal where the conditions for granting release appear to have

been fulfilled or shall submit the petition of the criminal to be
released together with his opinion.
Article 204.- Period of Probation.
Upon ordering conditional release the Court shall fix a period of
probation which unless otherwise ordered, shall expire at the end
of the sentence or the measure which remains to be undergone.
This period shall in no case be of less than two years nor, subject
to any provision to the contrary, of more than five years. In the
case of a criminal sentenced to life imprisonment the period of
probation shall not be less than five years and not more than
seven years.
Article 205.- Rules of Conduct and of Supervision.
(1) Appropriate rules of conduct to be observed by the probationer
during the period of probation shall be laid down in accordance
with the foregoing general provisions (Art. 198).
They shall, in particular, take into account the age and character
of the released prisoner, the risk to which he may be exposed and
the degree of the reliability of his family, employment and social
circumstances upon leaving the institution.
The fulfillment of these conditions shall, as far as possible, be
prepared prior to release with the assistance of the management
of the institution and the protection, guardianship or the
competent public authority.
(2) The released probationer shall, unless otherwise ordered, be
subject to the supervision, direction and guidance of a protector
or charitable organization (Art. 208). However, this measure may
not be passed in cases where it cannot be enforced or where its
enforcement is unnecessary.
Article 206.- Result of Probation.
(1) The requirements for probation and conditions under which it
can be revoked shall be governed by the forgoing general
provisions (Art. 200).
(2) When the conditional release has been revoked the released
person shall be sent back to the institution from which he had
been released.
The time spent in conditional liberty shall not be deducted from
the term of the sentence or duration of the measure still to be
undergone.
If a fresh crime has meanwhile been committed, subject to the
provisions regarding recidivism (Arts. 67 and 188), the penalty to
be pronounced for the new crime shall be added to the remaining
penalty

(3) If the released person is of good behaviour until the expiration of
the period, of probation his release shall be final and his penalty
extinguished.
Article 207.- Effect of Prohibitions and Other Measures.
(1) When, in addition to a penalty entailing toss of liberty, a
prohibition to practice a trade or profession (Art- 123(c)), to
resort to certain places or there to reside, or obligatory residence
or
expulsion
(Arts.
145-150)
has been ordered, the Court may, in the event of conditional
release and upon such release, order by way of probation, the
suspension of the prohibition (Art. 152) if having regard to all the
circumstances it seems desirable.
It shaft be guided by the degree of reform of the released person,
the disappearance or diminution of his dangerous disposition
and the favourable effect that suspension may be expected to
produce
on
his
reinstatement.
(2) The Court shall so decide after enquiry (if any) and on the
recommendation of the penitentiary authority and the
appropriate supervisory authority and the appropriate
supervisory authorities.
It shall determine the conditions, limitation or guarantees
(security, control, etc.) upon which the attempt at resumption of
normal life shall be conditioned.
(3) When a conditionally released criminal has behaved himself in
accordance with the rules of conduct imposed upon him without
any blame and appears to be reformed such that it is not likely
that he will again commit the crime for which a penalty
restricting liberty or entailing expulsion was imposed, the
additional penalty or measure that was imposed upon him shall
no longer be applied.
Sub-section III.- Supervision by a Charitable Organization
Article 208.- Principle.
Supervision by a charitable organization is an essential feature of
the system aiming at obtaining good results from the
enforcement of penalties and measures and the various methods
whereby such enforcement is carried out.
The placing under the supervision of a charitable organization is
compulsory in all cases where the law so provides. In all other
cases a criminal either conditionally or finally released may at all
times voluntarily have recourse to the help or assistance of such
an organization. The responsible charitable bodies shall be
bound to afford him their assistance.
Article 209.- Purpose and Duties.

(1) The duties of the charitable organizations consist in affording
criminals who have to readjust themselves to life in the
community, either during a period of suspension or after their
conditional or final release from a penalty or a measure entailing
lost of liberty, counsel, guidance and moral and material
assistance with a view to achieving the purpose of reinstatement
which is aimed at, and forestalling a future relapse.
The appointed charitable organization may, in particular, place
the protected
persons
in employment or find for them, or
assist them in finding, work, an employer, lodgings or relief,
direct them as to the proper use of their savings or earnings and,
generally, give them every other support necessary to enable
them to lead an honest life.
(2) It shall exercise regular supervision over them but with such
discretion as is proper so as not to, risk impairing their
rehabilitation, and report to the Court and to the competent
authorities whenever necessary.
Article 210.- Organization.
(1) The aforesaid duties shall be carried out by the association or
groups, of a public or private character, which devote their
activity thereto, with the assistance and under the control of
the State.
They may be entrusted to a qualified protector or probation
officer of unimpeachable morality, to be appointed from
case to case.
Unless otherwise necessary they shall not be entrusted to
police authorities.
(2) The detailed conditions shall be regulated in law concerning
the enforcement of penalties and orders dealing with this
matter.

of lodging a complaint or accusation to the competent public
authorities.
Article 212.- Crimes Punishable upon a Formal Complaint.

Article 216.- Principle and Effect.
(1) Unless otherwise provided by law, in all criminal cases the
prosecution and the criminal action shall be barred and may no
longer be instituted or brought upon the expiration of the legal
period of time stated below.

Limitation extinguishes the liability to punishment in respect to
any of the participants. As soon as the limitation period has
elapsed neither a conviction nor penalties or measures may be
pronounced.
(2) Even where .the defendant fails to raise the barring of the charge
by a period of limitation the Court or the Prosecutor shall, at any
time, consider the barring of the charge by limitation.

the concurrent crimes are different.
Article 218 Special Periods.
Subject to the provision of Article 213, the period of limitation of
any crime punishable upon complaint shall be two years.
Article 219 Calculation of Periods.
(1) Limitation periods shall be determined on the basis of the
maximum penalty provided by the provision of the Special Part
without regard to the extenuating or aggravating circumstances
involved in the case.
Where the law penalizes the act with several penalties to be
applied either alternatively or concurrently the periods shall be
calculated on the basis of the most severe penalty.

(2) The limitation period shall begin to run from the day on which
the criminal first exercised his criminal activity.
If the criminal act was committed repeatedly the period shall
begin to run from the day on which the last act was performed; if
it was pursued over a period of time the period shall begin to run
from the day on which it ceased.
Where achieving a given result is one of the constituents of the
crime the period shall begin to run on the day on which this
result occurred.
Article 220.- Suspension of Period of Limitation.
(1) Limitation shall be temporarily suspended as long as there
subsists a bar in law or in fact.
It shall also be suspended where a charge has been instituted
and the case is undergoing a judicial proceeding, or where the
decision in the criminal case against the defendant cannot be
given until other proceedings have been completed.
Upon removal of the bar the period of limitation shall revive and
continue its course.
(2) In all cases where the law requires the lodging of a complaint for
the institution of a prosecution the absence of this formality
shall not prevent the limitation period from running.
Similarly, any act of the criminal voluntarily done to hinder the
institution or continuation of the prosecution shall not prevent
the limitation period from running.
Article 221.- Interruption of Period of Limitation.
The limitation period shall be interrupted by any order, act or
decision for purposes of search, summons, prosecution or
investigation in relation to the crime or the criminals.
Upon each interruption the whole period of limitation shall begin
to run afresh.
The interrupting act shall be absolute as to its effect; it is
effectual towards all the participants in the crime, whether
known or unknown.
Article 222.- Absolute Limitation.
Whatever the circumstances may be the prosecution and the
criminal action shall be barred in all cases when a period equal
to double the ordinary period of limitation provided by law (Art.
217) has elapsed or, in cases where a special period applies (Art.
